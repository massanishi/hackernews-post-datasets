Clearly free market has failed here.<p>Again just imagine: 1 bank that nothing to sell to you, no fees, instant actions.<p>I feel whole loan money industry is riding on top of neutral and crucial service of being able to store and transfer money.<p>Institutional problems shouldn&#x27;t be solved with complicated technologies until last resort, so no blockchains.","time":1525460040,"title":"Ask HN: Is there a reason there isn't just one bank?","type":"story"},{"by":"gldalmaso","descendants":82,"id":16997059,"kids":[17001746,17002105,17001559,16999398,17000596,17000569,17000052,17003177,16999095,17000189,17002616,17000919,17000232,17000290,17003075,17000450,17005608,17000328,17001500],"score":169,"time":1525458812,"title":"Version 6 of Angular Now Available","type":"story","url":"https://blog.angular.io/version-6-of-angular-now-available-cc56b0efa7a4"},{"by":"stuck_in_a_rut","descendants":3,"id":16997050,"kids":[16997384,16997146],"score":6,"text":"This is hard to even talk about.<p>I&#x27;m a software engineer.

My reasoning is that, while I know of some people who have gotten in, it would seem there is a tipping point where the odds are so low that there really is no point in making the attempt. It&#x27;s the lottery ticket problem - the payoff is large, however the odds of winning are infinitesimal.<p>So, is there a metric of how many developers there are currently divided by how many open positions there are at MSFT, AWS, Facebook etc somehow adjusted for the skill level of the average developer?

I transferred because the CS degree program I was in wasn’t challenging, and the department was severely underfunded and understaffed. I felt miserable, despite having a small but close friend group there. I couldn’t get into classes, the ones I were in were terribly taught, and I just felt like my life wasn’t going anywhere.<p>However, now that I am in this top program, I feel even more miserable. The CS major is GPA capped, and at this point there is a good chance I won’t make it into the major. The classes I have been taking to get into the major alternate between boring review of concepts I previously learned, and unbelievably challenging material that I can barely comprehend. As a result, my grades in those classes have been steadily declining. I feel very demotivated and stressed, especially since finals are coming up.<p>Additionally, this school is all the way across the country from where I grew up. I knew nobody in this city before I came here, and even now I only really know my roommate and 1 other friend.<p>Finally, to top it all off, I didn’t get a tech internship this summer despite applying to around 90 companies. I even got to the final round of interviews at 2 companies, but still got rejected. I signed up for a summer class during the second half of the summer, but I’m worried that it will just stress me out even more. Plus I have no idea what to do for the first half of summer! I really don’t want to bum around my parents house, as they are already disappointed that I didn’t get an internship. Last summer I helped create a startup, but I left due to issues with the other founders.<p>Really I’m just writing this post to ask for advice. What to do if I don’t get into the CS major?

Through the following link you can enter your ideas in an online padlet (no registration necessary and completely anonymous).\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;padlet.com&#x2F;tvanorsouw&#x2F;f7wbwyn2o9es<p>More information about the RFID technology, the development that we’ve made, the purpose of the brainstorm and explanation about padlet can be found via the following

They primarily invested other people’s money, not their own. This ultimately drove the business into the ground, as they had software that barely did anything and no money left for anything else.

seen a recurring theme on HN lately of engineers who are looking for jobs talking about how daunting the interview process is these days--several intense rounds of technical interviews and days of take home projects for several companies, followed by dozens of rejections even for good engineers. I think this is a symptom of the most desirable jobs having a daunting number of qualified applicants. In many ways it makes a lot of sense that you should have to work your ass off and be competitive to get the most desirable jobs. But as an individual it often doesn&#x27;t make sense for an experienced engineer to spend hours, days and weeks to prove and reprove themselves when their education, experience, existing projects and references should be able to prove that they&#x27;re a good engineer with a lot less effort.<p>It seems like traditional tips for efficiently navigating a job search apply less and less these days. You can be a great engineer, have a great resume, connections at the company, get lots of interviews, and have great interviewing skills but it&#x27;s still a lot of work to land a good software engineering job these days.<p>So my question is, what are some strategies you use to interview with multiple companies, prove yourself and get competitive offers that you can compare without exhausting yourself with all of the parallel interview processes? Job search burnout is real. How do you avoid it while still pursuing the jobs you want?","time":1524780351,"title":"Ask HN: How do you navigate a software engineering job search?","type":"story"},{"by":"josephscott","descendants":5,"id":16936248,"kids":[16936990,16936765,16936662],"score":19,"time":1524779868,"title":"Exploit/bypass PHP escapeshellarg/escapeshellcmd functions","type":"story","url":"https://security.szurek.pl/exploit-bypass-php-escapeshellarg-escapeshellcmd.html"},{"by":"econner","descendants":60,"id":16936363,"kids":[16936897,16937374,16937453,16937205,16936865,16937310,16936907,16937673,16937555,16937602,16937716,16937005,16938481,16937538,16937094,16938483,16937620],"score":61,"time":1524780689,"title":"Think about Equity","type":"story","url":"http://foundersatwork.posthaven.com/think-about-equity"},{"by":"lechiffre10","descendants":62,"id":16936192,"kids":[16936387,16936351,16936305,16936408,16936704,16936367,16936566,16936436,16936468,16936563,16936300,16936413,16936308,16936415,16936339,16936281,16936262],"score":34,"time":1524779451,"title":"Amazon to increase fee of prime from $99 to $119 in U.S","type":"story","url":"https://www.recode.net/2018/4/26/17287476/amazon-prime-new-price-increase-119-99-dollars"},{"by":"athesyn","descendants":24,"id":16936169,"kids":[16936726,16937482,16937318,16937719,16936772,16938888,16937156,16937890,16937270,16941544],"score":43,"text":"And where can I find ones that aren&#x27;t?

Much of the surplus savings people in high-paying jobs are accruing will be garnished by colleges in the form of increased tuition + room and board down the road. In a weird way, you could argue this affects the decisionmaking about the number of kids you can have.<p>(2) High salary + need enough space =&gt; moving away from the city, a massive detractor from wellbeing. The obvious problem is the commute; the less obvious one is becoming disconnected from friends, which is particularly acute in &#x27;transient cities&#x27; like SF and NYC. Marginal commuting costs also somewhat offset the marginal gains of a high-paying job that&#x27;s further away.<p>(3) High-paying jobs generally mean longer hours, increased stress, and are often higher risk. Vacation in the US tends to be very low. These days there&#x27;s also an increasing obligation to be &#x27;always on&#x27;.<p>(4) Some costs tend to scale with salary: prop taxes near high-salary regions, insurance. Home ownership itself (arguably unrelated to being upper middle) is usually net losing or poor ROI vs renting.<p>So it seems like a surprisingly bad game to be upper middle class: you work harder to make not that much more marginal wealth, with less time to live well and (likely) fewer enriching social connections.<p>What are some ways to hack around this?

Some &#x27;pros&#x27; include: it can reduce repetitive tasks, cut down on workplace injury, and offer greater efficiency a majority of the time. It&#x27;s no surprise more companies are looking towards automation.<p>However, I believe there is a mismatch in terms of benefit to society and benefit to the corporations. Aside from initial capital and maintenance costs, automation provides businesses a way to profit without having to deal with the costs of paying and managing people. Assuming the role of the business is individualistic, the incentive is to pull in as much profit as possible, and work towards reducing costs. My takeaway from this is that self-interest also creates a lack of employee-interest.<p>For example, with low-skill, low-reward jobs such as cashier, most people may not care if they get automated (as we sort of have today with self-checkout&#x2F;kiosks) since they were not very desirable jobs to begin with. Yet, what is to stop a business from automating other more &quot;desirable&quot; jobs that employees may actually want and enjoy doing, such as software developer, strategist, manager, etc. - the higher paying jobs that people train for and aspire for to put their productivity to good use. If it saves the business (or executives at the top) money by axing those jobs, my guess is that they will do it, regardless if it hurts their employees (or impacts greater society).<p>So with this in mind, where is the moral limit for automation?<p>Should we protect employees from having their jobs taken away for a more profitable alternative?<p>(I&#x27;m not counting on things like UBI in this instance because, sticking with the presumption of corporate self-interest, I&#x27;m not assuming that more profit = more paid in taxes for society, if taxes are another undesirable &quot;cost&quot; that businesses would want to reduce).","time":1524762041,"title":"Ask HN: Is it morally right to automate jobs people want?","type":"story"},{"by":"arctux","descendants":198,"id":16933736,"kids":[16935012,16935247,16935439,16935094,16934430,16934190,16934627,16940185,16934878,16934168,16934178,16934333,16937196,16962842,16937312,16938623,16934692,16934219,16935823,16934665,16936135,16934279],"score":738,"time":1524762980,"title":"Matrix and Riot Confirmed as the Basis for France’s Secure Instant Messenger App","type":"story","url":"https://matrix.org/blog/2018/04/26/matrix-and-riot-confirmed-as-the-basis-for-frances-secure-instant-messenger-app/"},{"by":"rco8786","descendants":2,"id":16933652,"kids":[16935428,16933945],"score":1,"text":"I&#x27;ve gotten email notifications from 6-8 tech companies recently about privacy policy updates.

Caelum is a digital therapeutic for Irritable Bowel Syndrome. We optimize your diet and figure out which foods are driving your stomach problems.<p>Lauren is an MD from UPenn who saw how patients with stomach problems (IBS alone affects 15-20% of people) couldn’t get the care they need. The best treatments - diet and lifestyle changes -  work in clinical trials, but are extremely hard to execute in the real world without continuous expert guidance. Very few patients have the resources to afford this type of guidance.<p>Our app fixes this by providing 1-on-1 digital coaching (via messaging). We guide patients through the leading IBS diet (the Low-FODMAP Diet) with turn-by-turn directions and daily lessons&#x2F;exercises.<p>Currently, the diet requires several stages of eliminating food groups and then adding them back in to see whether symptoms change - forcing each patient to “start from scratch” even though many other patients have gone through the same process. We leverage user data to personalize each patient’s program based on their eating habits, past food trials, and demographics (age, gender, ethnicity, etc).<p>We’re launching our consumer-facing product and will be starting our clinical trial soon.<p>We’re a sibling team and have wanted to start a company together since we were kids. When Luke went into tech and then business school, and Lauren into healthcare investing and then medical school, we thought it probably wouldn’t happen. We were obviously wrong. We became pretty obsessed with bringing data to medicine and applying it to the treatments right in front of us: food, exercise, sleep, stress-reduction.","time":1524678108,"title":"Launch HN: Caelum  Health (YC S17) – Digital Therapeutic for Stomach Problems","type":"story"},{"by":"tosh","descendants":16,"id":16923900,"kids":[16925295,16924204,16927835,16924954,16924315,16927060,16925199],"score":39,"time":1524677473,"title":"WeWork documents reveal it owes $18B in rent","type":"story","url":"https://www.businessinsider.de/wework-500-million-bond-sale-financials-analysis-2018-4"},{"by":"willvarfar","descendants":23,"id":16923655,"kids":[16929542,16925502,16925743,16926992,16926140,16926251,16924624],"score":81,"time":1524676062,"title":"Swedish archaeologists reveal 5th Century massacre at Sandby borg","type":"story","url":"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43899393"},{"by":"moultano","descendants":294,"id":16923609,"kids":[16923797,16923903,16923942,16923867,16924001,16925197,16923915,16924393,16923971,16924083,16923877,16924644,16924248,16924270,16924610,16923919,16924166,16924230,16923834,16924400,16923950,16923937,16923849,16924951,16924491,16923820,16923848,16925043,16923883,16923898,16924812,16924458,16924419,16925460,16929104,16924104,16924433,16924562,16923939,16923928,16924267,16923782],"score":127,"time":1524675821,"title":"90-minute ‘super commutes’ more common as Bay Area housing shortage intensifies","type":"story","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/04/25/nightmare-90-minute-super-commutes-more-common-housing-shortage-intensifies/"},{"by":"juliosueiras","descendants":3,"id":16923598,"kids":[16925428,16924142],"score":3,"text":"the current top trending repo on github is https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sikaozhe1997&#x2F;Xin-Yue, which is regarding a sensitive case in China.<p>A portion on the issues is arguing whether should this kind of repo use Github as the discussions platform","time":1524675775,"title":"Ask HN: Should GitHub use as a political discussion platform?","type":"story"},{"by":"jcwayne","descendants":6,"id":16923521,"kids":[16923992,16923809,16924191],"score":48,"time":1524675440,"title":"NYSE suspends trading in Amazon, Alphabet due to pricing issue","type":"story","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/25/nyse-suspends-trading-for-amazon-alphabet-due-to-pricing-issue.html"},{"by":"prokes","descendants":4,"id":16923439,"kids":[16923459,16926258,16930853],"score":6,"text":"I have received many emails in the past week from companies updating their Privacy Policy and Terms of Service, far more than normal.

brought it up mostly since my mom and her cousin suggested that I go with a speech therapist to help me get job offers. I am a software engineer with experience, having worked in 4 past jobs as a SWE. But I have never had to look for jobs for so long before. In the past, I usually get an offer within a few months. But after 2014 it&#x27;s been different. I was laid off from a full-time job and I haven&#x27;t been able to get anything full-time since.<p>I am a self-taught programmer. have entered the industry 11 years ago but I don&#x27;t believe ageism is playing a part here. Still getting no adverse feedback on that as I look young for my age.<p>I have a few projects on Github and more recently I&#x27;m too burned out to do another programming project. But I continue to read articles and posts on the software industry, chat with others to stay abreast of local events.<p>My greatest bottleneck would be with the interviewing process. My resume is not the main problem, as I&#x27;ve gotten into many interviews with it. I have been able to get several phone interviews, but hard to pass them. My last on-site was in 2017.<p>Despite that, I have landed three contracts for freelance work, one from a former employer who already is familiar with me and my work, and the other two from Redditors who were seeking game developers. They were convinced by my projects and was able to deliver a good job to them.<p>So while I&#x27;m able to get some freelance work through unconventional means, what I am really looking for in the long run is a steady full-time job. Jobs applied through Indeed, StackOverflow, LinkedIn, etc. net me no offers.<p>A few family members have said that I show traits that might put me on the autism spectrum. I don&#x27;t have unemployed insurance. But my family wants me to go through a service that treats people with social disabilities in order to start working again. So is three years long enoug reason for doing so? Or is it approaching the norm for programmers?","time":1524624097,"title":"Ask HN: Been job searching for 3 years.

For some of you this may be silly, but I&#x27;ll give my story a try. I applied for this software developer engineer internship 3 years in row (sounds pretty bad, huh?). The first time I applied, I was in my first year as a student. I was rejected as there were better suited candidates for the positions. A year later, I applied for the job early, passed a test and waited to be called for an interview after a recruiter told me I did well on my written test. I got an answer a month later, saying that the positions were filled, but that there were other positions available, but not as software developer engineer intern. For example, there was a position as a system developer engineer intern. I refused the offer, as I found another job in the meanwhile and was in the process of signing the contract. Third year, this year, the recruiting techniques changed. There is no written test. There is only one interview where a software engineer interviews you for about an hour. I went to the interview and noticed, from the beginning, that the interviewer did not know that I had a job. I found that thing strange, as it was listed in my CV on the first page. How could he have missed it? Taking a glimpse at the CV made me notice it was not the latest one: he had an older version of my CV. I offered to send him the CV from my phone, but he refused. The rest of the interview consisted of solving some pretty easy exercises. In the last few minutes, he prompted me to ask him anything about the internship. I took this opportunity to talk, asked a few questions, and then tried to share more about what my experience is in the field. He did not seem to be very interested in my background. What if he made a bad impression reading my old version of the CV? I have gained a lot of experience and practiced more this past year or so and the old version did not do me justice.","time":1524294891,"title":"Ask HN: Could an old CV ruin my chances?","type":"story"},{"by":"randomdrake","descendants":29,"id":16890274,"kids":[16890478,16892444,16890542,16891075,16891644,16890388,16891538,16892257,16890627,16923012,16891382,16890769,16893981,16890522],"score":218,"time":1524293126,"title":"Mapping the internet with Hilbert curves","type":"story","url":"https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/scan-ping-the-internet-hilbert-curve"},{"by":"_o_","descendants":118,"id":16890243,"kids":[16890440,16890497,16890261,16892719,16890494,16891936,16890375,16891180,16891769,16890362],"score":225,"time":1524292188,"title":"Google's Project Zero exposes unpatched Windows 10 lockdown bypass","type":"story","url":"https://www.zdnet.com/article/googles-project-zero-reveals-windows-10-lockdown-bypass/"},{"by":"hammerbrostime","descendants":7,"id":16890172,"kids":[16890600,16894347,16891252,16893526,16890233],"score":6,"text":"If you code, get computer glasses.

We&#x27;re Ed and Jeremie, the founders of SharpestMinds in YC&#x27;s W18 batch. We&#x27;re building a free online community for ML&#x2F;AI developers through which they can access job opportunities. (You can apply to join it at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sharpestminds.com&#x2F;members\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sharpestminds.com&#x2F;members</a>)<p>We&#x27;re ML developers from non traditional backgrounds. Ed did a PhD in biological physics, and Jeremie studied quantum optics before dropping out of grad school to work on SharpestMinds. We started looking for ML jobs after school, thinking it shouldn&#x27;t be too hard to get one. We found to our naive surprise that we fell short on a number of skills that are needed to do good work in industry. You just don&#x27;t learn much devops in grad school.<p>As a result we decided to build something that would make it easier for ML devs to develop (and discover!) skills they might be missing, and then get their first jobs or internships. From the outset we also wanted to build a community around the process, since looking for your first job is usually a pretty lonely experience. Because we monetize directly through hiring, we can afford to create a space for discussion without ads or algorithmic distractions :)<p>Our typical users so far have been grad students who know ML material well, but don&#x27;t yet have much, or any, practical experience. However, you don&#x27;t need a degree at all (a few of our users are self-taught high school dropouts), and anyone who knows the material is welcome. In fact, that&#x27;s one of the advantages of our system: we test directly for knowledge, so it doesn&#x27;t matter how you got that knowledge or how long it took you to get it. One of our goals is that by the time we present you as a candidate, things that would otherwise be holes in your resumé don&#x27;t matter so much, and we can make that case to companies that are hiring.<p>To qualify for joining, you do an online deep learning quiz (here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sharpestminds.com&#x2F;members&#x2F;apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sharpestminds.com&#x2F;members&#x2F;apply</a>), followed by a technical interview. If you pass both, we invite you aboard. It&#x27;s possible to retake the quiz a month later if you don&#x27;t pass it, and we&#x27;ll send you tips on what to study in the meantime.<p>Once you join you get access to a job board with exclusive (i.e., not scraped) internship and full-time opportunities on it. We&#x27;ve created an application system where your profile gets customized to the job you&#x27;re applying for, to maximize the odds that you&#x27;ll get an interview. We also have lists of common interview questions, mentors that you can practice interviewing with, and periodic AMAs with ML hiring managers from companies like Skydio and Airbnb.<p>The hardest part about building this has been figuring out the best way to present our users to employers. Early on we found that hiring managers were passing on qualified people, because their eyes would glaze over from reading too many CVs. We ended up building application profiles that let our users display their most relevant personal projects prominently in their application. The interview rate has increased significantly as a result.<p>If our approach works for the ML&#x2F;AI field, we&#x27;d like to build communities like this for other fields too.<p>We&#x27;re looking forward to getting feedback and hearing ideas from HN! We know there are lots of ML devs &#x2F; enthusiasts on here, and we&#x27;d also be very interested in hearing about your own experiences making the transition, or similar programs you might know about. We&#x27;d also be interested in hearing about what, in your experience, are the most important programming skills needed by someone with a good knowledge base but little practical experience to be a strong contributor at their first job or internship.","time":1524156536,"title":"Launch HN: SharpestMinds (YC W18) – Online Community for AI

We achieve scale for this by solving the fundamental economic problems with the proof-of-work and proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms. If you look into the network design, we think we&#x27;ll blow your mind!<p>Anyway, we&#x27;ve been reading the discussions here for the past several months about whether blockchains are useful and... well... hopefully Saito is going to end that debate! So if you&#x27;re interested in blockchain technology or just open-minded, I really hope you&#x27;ll check us out and let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions or questions. Right now we have an online demo, downloadable code on Github, and some resources explaining how Saito works and how to get started building apps with it.<p>Also, I should probably also mention that we&#x27;re hiring, with the caveat that we&#x27;re in Asia so anyone interested in joining the team should either be in this part of the world already or happy to work remotely.","time":1524145266,"title":"Show HN: A new blockchain that can do email on-chain","type":"story"},{"by":"SoapSeller","descendants":169,"id":16875730,"kids":[16876520,16876048,16876343,16875982,16876088,16876234,16875979,16876830,16876682,16876005,16882646,16875997,16875941,16876403,16876132,16875962,16876705,16878746,16876802,16876279,16876254,16876502,16876315,16882608,16878164,16876585,16877606,16877761,16876453,16876533,16876152,16876209,16876111,16875988,16876931,16876387,16876149],"score":125,"time":1524144655,"title":"Widescreen laptops are dumb","type":"story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/4/19/17027286/laptop-widescreen-aspect-ratio"},{"by":"okmeyou","descendants":3,"id":16875682,"kids":[16879944,16876964],"score":30,"time":1524144219,"title":"A Great User Onboarding Process Flow Creates Happy Users","type":"story","url":"https://hackernoon.com/a-great-user-onboarding-process-flow-creates-happy-users-8e4e730aa627"},{"by":"bratao","descendants":83,"id":16875587,"kids":[16876313,16876275,16875807,16876035,16877598,16876042,16876499,16877038,16876850,16886366,16876817,16876212],"score":205,"time":1524143373,"title":"AMD 2nd Gen Ryzen Deep Dive","type":"story","url":"https://www.anandtech.com/show/12625/amd-second-generation-ryzen-7-2700x-2700-ryzen-5-2600x-2600"},{"by":"afshinmeh","descendants":4,"id":16875577,"kids":[16879384,16877472],"score":14,"time":1524143307,"title":"One red paperclip","type":"story","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_red_paperclip"},{"by":"spooneybarger","descendants":7,"id":16875517,"kids":[16877948,16875538,16877263,16878398],"score":91,"time":1524142921,"title":"Designing a Userspace Disk I/O Scheduler for Modern Datastores (2016)","type":"story","url":"https://www.scylladb.com/2016/04/14/io-scheduler-1/"},{"by":"cher14","descendants":29,"id":16875497,"kids":[16875793,16877480,16875934,16875766,16875902,16876508,16875914,16879211,16877353,16881918,16883445,16882095,16877181,16879268],"score":360,"time":1524142744,"title":"Flow chart of cognitive biases","type":"story","url":"https://www.breakdown-notes.com/makemap/load/biases"},{"by":"fahd777","descendants":56,"id":16875293,"kids":[16875924,16876639,16877015,16876742,16881717,16879523,16879527,16875582],"score":257,"time":1524141117,"title":"A manufacturing process that produces long strips of high-quality graphene","type":"story","url":"https://news.mit.edu/2018/manufacturing-graphene-rolls-ultrathin-membranes-0418"},{"by":"deadcoder0904","descendants":3,"id":16875208,"kids":[16876721,16875706],"score":2,"text":"Sometimes crowd-sourcing takes time &amp; if you already have a market you can get a lot of data for free via scraping.<p>So what should I know regarding Web Scraping?<p>Not all websites provide API, so many people scrape content.<p>What are the legal implications?<p>Have you scraped any?

This is not the very first time in my 5 years plus career that I am facing this situation. However , this time and probably the very first time I feel paralyzed and almost defeated by this feature that am trying to build since almost a week (including the weekend). Every solution I build fails to achieve one or more core scenarios or unit tests. I am almost at the end of my estimated schedule without a stable feature that I am to deliver and demo this week to end users. I am extremely passionate about the software development craft (with a big thanks to the HN community for that!). I love solving such problems and have done so from the very moment I took my first software dev role right out of college. I really don&#x27;t know why am feeling unusually stressed out due to this one seemingly unconquerable feature. Inspite of having put in extra hours at work I see no perfect solution on the horizon . What makes me even more disappointed in myself is that as a senior developer I am unable to solve this , and I aspire to work in companies like Microsoft , Amazon etc. Seeking advice from this wonderful community. How do I deal with this and what are some steps I could follow to get through this without losing my mind? What can I do to prevent myself from having a nervous breakdown like this in future? How did you deal with such situations in your career and get out of it still standing tall? Thanks!","time":1523907074,"title":"Ask HN: Developer's Block.

Over the last few years I began to dabble in web development, loved it and can see myself moving more towards software development - within the book publishing world (that is heading towards software-driven workflows anyway) or completely separate from it.\nFor every project so far I&#x27;ve basically laid the tracks while riding the train with full speed behind and I&#x27;ve now come to a point where I need to decide how to move forward. I&#x27;ve built a nice project for work in Node&#x2F;Express&#x2F;React, but it&#x27;s certainly no masterpiece and makes heavy use of third-party libraries and frameworks, abstracting away a lot of stuff that I don&#x27;t understand.<p>My question is: do I push forward in that fashion or do I take a step back and really learn how to program first?<p>The reason why I ask is because I do not feel confident in my programming skills. Often I find myself bruteforcing code until it finally works, not really being able to answer why it does. I was thinking about enrolling in http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.launchschool.com to get a solid understanding of core programming principles and gain the confidence to move forward in any direction in software development. It would force me to follow an organized path toward learning software development and not get ahead of myself as I currently do.\nYet a part of me says: you already built stuff, why go back and start over? Just keep coding and you&#x27;ll get more comfortable. Being 34 years old I feel like I&#x27;m already behind the curve in software development. And since most of my learning happens in my free time, shouldn&#x27;t I keep on having fun with it and not make it feel like I&#x27;m going back to university?<p>What would you recommend? Is it possible to be a software&#x2F;web developer by just learning as you go?

I consider myself very broadly skilled, having designed high-performance electronics (board level, never IC level),done FPGA development, including DSP, and programming from embedded up in a few programming languages, even occasionally contributing to some open-source projects. I also oversaw several short-run manufacturing and deployment, which is a skill set by itself.<p>However, I have some anxiety on which path to follow. Should I focus on:<p>* learning a particular set of board-level design tools for getting my foot in SV consumer electronics companies?<p>* try to get a PhD and learn analog IC design?<p>* using my current experience to get a decent paying job in a FAANG (all of them seem to be doing HW now, except maybe Netflix) and set foot on the door?<p>As you see, I have some anxiety and maybe people here could help. Maybe my software skills could put me in a better track, but I first want to check if I can make better use of my 10+ hardware-focused career.<p>Thank you.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=16811454\n[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=16811968","time":1523804347,"title":"Ask HN: Which hardware careers can be high-paying?","type":"story"},{"by":"infokiller","descendants":2,"id":16842745,"kids":[16847366,16847713],"score":9,"time":1523802295,"title":"Show HN: Google Search Navigator – navigate Google like a boss","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/infokiller/google-search-navigator"},{"by":"askmr","descendants":13,"id":16842587,"kids":[16860085,16854845,16843093],"score":6,"text":"Are all the YouTube videos submitted not viewed as a part of the application?

originally wanted to build an email client fully in the browser, but realized I can&#x27;t do TCP connections (for IMAP) directly inside the browser.<p>I came up with a few alternative:<p>&quot;Hosted&quot; version:<p>Hosted service that runs IMAP on a back-end, and roughly &quot;proxies&quot; IMAP over a WebSocket. This is the best for the user, because no download&#x2F;setup, just a web page. This also enabled easy push notification (IDLE process on back-end -&gt; push notifications). It would make it very easy adapt to mobile too.<p>Con: the service must store&#x2F;see email credentials for the users, and all their data being ran through a service they don&#x27;t control. Although it wouldn&#x27;t actually store any email data or use it in anyway, I don&#x27;t think everyone is comfortable with this idea.<p>&quot;Desktop&quot;&#x2F;bridge version:<p>A program that you run on your computer, which acts as the bridge between your browser and the IMAP server. Like the hosted one, but directly on your computer. This would mean the users have full control over their data.<p>Con: must be downloaded&#x2F;installed on desktop&#x2F;server. This could also be prepackaged with the actual interface inside an Electron-type of application, basically a normal desktop email client.<p>Mobile version:<p>With Flutter, TCP connections are possible, making it so an app could be made.<p>My problem with mobile is that this client would be focused for &quot;busy people&quot;, and mobile isn&#x27;t the best way to manage emails. Push notifications are essential and could be unreliable since it wouldn&#x27;t be using a third-party to use Google&#x2F;Apple&#x27;s push notifications, but would instead run as a background process.<p>The first version is the best for users, but the worse for privacy.

I like stuff like continuous integration, containerization etc but more from the development perspective (so I guess what you&#x27;d call devops, as much of a buzzword as that is).<p>I liked all the engineers I met with, and they made a point that operations works closely with development, but obviously don&#x27;t write any production code, just the scripting&#x2F;general automation coding around it.<p>I&#x27;m kind of rambling now but I think experience with AWS, kubernetes, network administration etc would help round out my skills, but I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s a better idea to focus on development and learn those skills as part of development rather than sort of separated from it.<p>Thanks for any advice","time":1523661530,"title":"Ask HN: Do I risk getting “pigeonholed” by accepting an Operations Engi. role?","type":"story"},{"by":"dbasedweeb","descendants":6,"id":16834698,"kids":[16834859,16834770,16835147],"score":28,"time":1523660860,"title":"Russian Court Bans Telegram App After 18-Minute Hearing","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/13/world/europe/russia-telegram-encryption.html"},{"by":"DiabloD3","descendants":114,"id":16834509,"kids":[16834925,16834603,16835438,16834831,16834693,16834939,16837285,16836606,16835212,16836958,16834798,16836420,16834836,16834834,16844538,16834630,16834826],"score":290,"time":1523659083,"title":"European Copyright Law Could Soon Get Worse","type":"story","url":"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/04/european-copyright-law-isnt-great-it-could-soon-get-lot-worse"},{"by":"DrScump","descendants":11,"id":16834401,"kids":[16834680,16835028,16836525],"score":39,"time":1523658180,"title":"Today’s Oceans and a 94M-Year-Old Catastrophe","type":"story","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/01/suffocating-oceans/550415/?single_page=true"},{"by":"ricksnyke","descendants":2,"id":16834243,"kids":[16834715,16834295],"score":7,"time":1523656740,"title":"The Real History of Programming Languages","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/p/cd93ec806124"},{"by":"ricksnyke","descendants":96,"id":16834181,"kids":[16835052,16834553,16834679,16834877,16834522,16835777,16834626,16837672,16834599,16838385,16834622,16834358,16834389],"score":217,"time":1523656188,"title":"Go gets preliminary WebAssembly support","type":"story","url":"https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/102835"},{"by":"rajnathani","descendants":21,"id":16834240,"kids":[16834533,16834513,16834521,16834652,16834592,16836338,16834514],"score":30,"text":"Few points relevant to a discussion around this question:<p>- While most users use pseudonyms, there are some users who do not, and most users (hypothesis from my side here) use their actual email address, and not a throw away email address or an email address exclusively created for HN.<p>- Hacker News has an API, though they (obviously) do not disclose the email addresses of any of its users in the API, they do however include HN usernames which alongwith the public posts also available in the API are attributable to given users, and therefore is indirectly personal information.<p>- Hacker News doesn’t support the deletion of comments and posts after a certain 24-48 hour period. Upon research I’ve learnt that one can contact PG or the HN News mods to have your content deleted on the platform, however this delete wouldn’t be enforceable on API consumers of HN, who may have a cache or a permanent archive of the data in any location (analogous to how FB is getting Cambridge Analytica to delete any of the user data which CA still has).<p>- HN’s severs with all user data is (I believe) located in California. Data residency in the EU doesn’t seem the case. Even if the case is made that all HN user information is in public forum, personal data such as users’ email addresses and favorites are private information stored on HN.<p>- Finally, the point about consequences. All the above points would seem null if HN really doesn’t have any revenue for it to be charged the 2-4% of global revenue as penalty for violating GDPR. However to this point I would like to issue a reminder that Hacker News is by all legal matters owned by Y Combinator (also on the company domain name *.ycombinator.com), and YC sure does rake in the revenue. Would HN legally be argued as some sort of a free non-profit forum, and thus not connected to YC for any GDPR violation? Currently YC companies have their hiring posts artificially promoted on HN’s front page, so there’s that thorn.","time":1523656705,"title":"Ask HN: Is Hacker News GDPR Compliant?","type":"story"},{"by":"sethbannon","descendants":57,"id":16834051,"kids":[16834241,16834271,16834562,16834590,16834445,16834405,16835268,16834457,16834172,16834184,16834301],"score":71,"time":1523654949,"title":"PullRequest pulls in $8M Series A just months after scoring seed round","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/13/pullrequest-pulls-in-8m-series-just-months-after-scoring-seed-round/"},{"by":"dsr12","descendants":2,"id":16833985,"kids":[16833996,16835111],"score":5,"time":1523654331,"title":"Excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake.

We&#x27;ve rented a bicycle to ride to Teuflesberg, and on the way back we took the train (with the bike). Little did we know - one must pay an extra fee to get bikes unto the train, so we were fined.\nThe whole encounter consumed too much precious time, and we were about to be late to return the bike.\nA hasty apologetic call to the bike owner, and 30 minutes of intense bike riding forward - and we were there.<p>While we were about to leave the store, the daughter of the owner (~50 years, or so) asked us where we were from. After we&#x27;ve told her we were Israelis, she offered us a ride to our motel.<p>During the ride, we&#x27;ve got to talk about everything - politics, history, and whatnot. And somewhere around the Jewish graveyard, she has told us about her father.<p>She told us about her father, as she remembered him - a kind, gentle, and loving man. \nAnd that he also served in the Wehrmacht.\nThat reading about the war, and remembering the man her father was to her was almost oxymoronic. And that he had never talked about the war.\nThe two of us read and hear testimonies by the survivors, and talked with them. But that was our first time hearing something close to a testimony of someone from &quot;the other side&quot;.<p>That story resonated with me.\nThe Israeli holocaust memorial day was held yesterday, and that story came back to me.

The issue is that my CEO has been a mentor who has helped me build an invaluable skill set and a friend but is pushing back on my ask to purchase my options.<p>He is extremely set in his view and feels that by me wanting to purchase my options I&#x27;m somehow am personally taking advantage of him or his business.

It&#x27;s hard to find that off the street, and training generally takes 12+ months to become independently capable.<p>I&#x27;ve generally heard feedback that this work isn&#x27;t interesting, or is overly complex, and the developers will seek to avoid it or minimize their work with it.<p>Has anyone come across this before, and if so - how did you get a team of developers to be interested and motivated to learn this field?","time":1523288741,"title":"Ask HN: How do I get developers to be interested?","type":"story"},{"by":"rmason","descendants":16,"id":16793983,"kids":[16795458,16794419,16797005],"score":42,"time":1523288639,"title":"Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak says he's left Facebook over data collection","type":"story","url":"https://www.freep.com/story/tech/2018/04/08/apple-co-founder-steve-wozniak-says-hes-leaving-facebook/497392002/"},{"by":"bgdam","descendants":4,"id":16793935,"kids":[16798689,16796185,16802720],"score":43,"time":1523288314,"title":"Show HN: Mocktastic – Simple, Offline mock REST APIs for your entire team","type":"story","url":"https://mocktastic.com"},{"by":"pavel_lishin","descendants":11,"id":16793886,"kids":[16797372,16796949,16799494,16795148,16797382,16794688,16795407,16797032],"score":127,"time":1523288026,"title":"Finding Dmitry: The Magical Story of a Russian Boy's Photos","type":"story","url":"https://flashbak.com/finding-dmitry-magical-story-russian-boys-photos-396364/"},{"by":"nothrows","descendants":159,"id":16793888,"kids":[16794227,16794475,16794209,16795417,16794482,16794263,16794629,16796086,16794648,16794779,16803555,16796668,16794469,16794529,16796964,16794849,16794320,16794703,16795192,16795626,16795593,16795120,16795110,16794476,16794213,16796037,16795718],"score":316,"time":1523288038,"title":"Microplastics found in 93% of bottled water tested in global study","type":"story","url":"http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/bottled-water-microplastics-1.4575045"},{"by":"pavel_lishin","descendants":148,"id":16793884,"kids":[16794750,16794367,16795684,16794544,16794494,16797606,16794872,16796241,16795321,16798404,16794513,16798253,16794445,16795378,16795923,16797963,16797248,16794408,16799585,16794571,16798815,16799592,16796051,16796937,16798177,16794407,16803421,16799062,16797995,16797443,16796478,16794415,16794905,16798403],"score":249,"time":1523288021,"title":"Project from Hell (2008)","type":"story","url":"https://projectfailures.wordpress.com/2008/06/24/project-from-hell/amp/?__twitter_impression=true"},{"by":"ohjeez","descendants":103,"id":16793804,"kids":[16794356,16794606,16794302,16794334,16794915,16794936,16797454,16794740,16796638,16795294,16794467],"score":166,"time":1523287643,"title":"ACE Submarine Cable Cut Impacts Ten Countries","type":"story","url":"https://dyn.com/blog/ace-submarine-cable-cut-impacts-ten-countries/"},{"by":"navigaid","descendants":135,"id":16793749,"kids":[16794160,16794292,16794651,16795166,16794956,16794174,16795038,16794946,16796948,16799274,16793980,16795800,16796587,16794473,16795891,16798397,16802883,16800604],"score":376,"time":1523287316,"title":"Android container in Chrome OS","type":"story","url":"https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform2/+/master/arc/container-bundle/"},{"by":"type12","descendants":22,"id":16793673,"kids":[16795213,16848162,16806142,16819242,16800355,16807833,16795461,16794054,16799511,16795909,16794549],"score":12,"text":"I&#x27;m working on a self-service product for SaaS that predicts which users will churn, are ready to buy or upgrade.

Using the efficient market framework, crypto mining can be seen as conversion of electricity (and the amortized value of hardware) into cryptocurrency.<p>Because of Venezuela&#x27;s currency collapse (as well as standard issues of the government propping up electricity prices), there&#x27;s a huge gulf between electricity prices and the value of USD.

A problem is file-io: The JSON model would have to be loaded into a React browser app using a input-file dialog. Afterwards the updated JSON would have to be downloaded and copied over the previous version of the JSON. The upside is that it &#x27;just runs&#x27;. No node.js installation or anything needed on developer systems. The downside is, that it can be unintuitive to use, e.g. the application state is lost, when the user hits F5 or the back-button.<p>An alternative to a browser app would be to use Electron, but the overhead of the binary version is a bit frightening due to embedded chrome&#x2F;nodejs. Open question (I should try that out): Is it possible to commit the binaries once, such that users just have to update the webapp part (html+js) from version control subsequently to get an up-to-date app?<p>Are there alternative approaches that I&#x27;m missing?<p>TLDR: Need a versionable GUI approach to transform a JSON document, which is readily runnable after syncing the GUI source and JSON-file from version control.

Now that my initial excitement has passed I have to soon make a difficult decision: which school?<p>I haven&#x27;t felt entirely comfortable asking acquaintances and colleagues for their opinions for fear of sounding conceited, so I decided to turn to HN to crowd-source some help. Hoping to get an aggregate opinion and&#x2F;or maybe find some specific points I haven&#x27;t considered from folks here.<p>- The case for Harvard - \nPros - The program is entirely case-method and discussion based. I&#x27;ll learn how to speak&#x2F;think under pressure. The students are from extremely diverse backgrounds. I can bring a unique perspective coming from a technical background. There is a lot of emphasis on &quot;big-picture&quot; thinking (ie. &quot;Reimagining Capitalism&quot;), though I&#x27;m not sure how practical this is. Access to VC funding. Strong bio&#x2F;healthcare activity (which will be a HUGE opportunity in the coming years).<p>Cons - The program is almost entirely skewed to business - 17 business classes &#x2F; 4 engineering. Many of the students come off as very elitist. The culture is somewhat... aggressive... I find a lot of type-A personalities. I&#x27;m fine in social situations, but I don&#x27;t particularly enjoy it. I listen to Bluegrass music and usually spend my weekends rock-climbing in NH. I don&#x27;t get that feel at HBS, but hey, maybe that&#x27;s an opportunity.<p>- The case for MIT -\nPros - I know I will be more comfortable at MIT. However, I don&#x27;t know if that is a good thing. The classes are taught with an analytical foundation and most people come from a technical background. I&#x27;ll be at the ground-floor for a lot of new tech that could be ready for commercialization.<p>Cons - I feel like I will be a techie among techies. Of course, the program will be hard, but very similar to how am used to operating.

The game has RPG elements, so getting the game design right means balancing a lot of numbers. Now I&#x27;m wondering how we can collect this data while being GDPR compliant.<p>We need to answer questions like:<p><pre><code>  - How many enemies has the player defeated when he reached level 5? \n  - What&#x27;s the win&#x2F;loss ratio for his fights? \n  - In which cities are the most players?\n</code></pre>\nThe game doesn&#x27;t have user accounts, there is no registration. I plan to collect the data by sending events like &quot;Player $X has found 250 gold&quot; where X is a randomly generated ID that is stored only on the device and cannot be seen by the user. The server that receives these events can tie the string of events together to answer the questions above.<p>Here&#x27;s the challenge:<p>Is this personal data? I think so, as the ID of the user uniquely identifies the user.<p>What if a user requests a copy of the data collected about him? I&#x27;d like to say that we cannot provide it, as it has been anonymized. However, in theory it would be possible to &quot;de-anonymize&quot; the data by retrieving the ID from the installed app.<p>So are we forced offer the option to retrieve the ID from the installed app, just to make it possible to de-anonymize the data, so that a user can retrieve a copy?<p>Technically it looks like the collected events are personal data. But in reality, it&#x27;s nothing &quot;personal&quot; like names, payment details, whatever online shops and social networks collect, just a log of game events.

Should I setup a karma&#x2F;money system for allowing users to post based on community engagement or would that stifle engagement? Should I review each post myself?

All I need is to practice for next 20 days.<p>Please help me with some resources or challenges type project that aims to make you better at CSS.","time":1522691682,"title":"Ask HN: Any step by step guide to get better in CSS with projects?","type":"story"},{"by":"uptown","descendants":1111,"id":16737072,"kids":[16738090,16738024,16737254,16738266,16737325,16737477,16737522,16737939,16740596,16737242,16737802,16740163,16737549,16737606,16740340,16738399,16740883,16737176,16737680,16737496,16738243,16737490,16744767,16737488,16740933,16739880,16737600,16739633,16737246,16737584,16739856,16738118,16738295,16742789,16740654,16737097,16737586,16738062,16741137,16738634,16737569,16747223,16737166,16738570,16740223,16741312,16737234,16737986,16738942,16738654,16739702,16737711,16739370,16737763,16740973,16737837,16737938,16738400,16742463,16738735,16738674,16740235,16741553,16739051,16738019,16739661,16738097,16740794,16741075,16747335,16740640,16737401,16737601,16740479,16738829,16737686,16737425,16738589,16739735,16741192,16737567,16738058,16737224,16739341,16737147,16743923,16737201,16739454,16737389,16737543,16737181,16744856,16738728,16740892,16737960,16737287,16737256,16743703,16741521,16741055,16740196,16743676,16742397,16738976,16739225,16740865,16741105,16738484,16753056,16737572,16737682,16742979,16737139,16737103,16741439,16740033],"score":1302,"time":1522691452,"title":"Apple Plans to Use Its Own Chips in Macs from 2020, Replacing Intel","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-02/apple-plans-to-move-from-intel-to-own-mac-chips-from-2020"},{"by":"leeale10","descendants":3,"id":16736887,"kids":[16737353,16737664],"score":12,"time":1522690639,"title":"How I would build Uber","type":"story","url":"https://airdev.co/post/how-i-would-build-uber-1522267669199x775452761445194600"},{"by":"stevekrouse","descendants":69,"id":16736913,"kids":[16739750,16739206,16742288,16738222,16738246,16738573,16738507,16741965,16742007,16739959,16739343],"score":165,"time":1522690755,"title":"A Visual History of Eve: 2014 -

This is largely driven by hopes to tackle some of the more fundamental challenges of our world, the idea that small firms offer a better ground to contribute to&#x2F;enjoy a positive working culture, and some idea to have more time for my family (compared to a lot of traveling and 70+h&#x2F;w at the moment). While not working in tech, I do have an engineering background  and some limited dev skills and good industry insights. I’m also confident to be able to execute projects&#x2F;products in agile environments and with challenging customers. I’m lucky to have accrued enough savings to sustain my family’s down-to-earth lifestyle for ~4yrs, but still wary about long-term implications of disrupting my career.<p>I’m wondering how to best go about it:<p>1.) Find a CTO role at a startup of interest. However, early stage startups often require more hands-on dev skills than I’d be comfortable with. Later stage roles are exceedingly rare in Europe. Career risks would be a bit more limited<p>2.) Take a non-exec role at a startup and use it to test the waters and grow from there. Easy to get but a huge break for my career<p>3.) Found. The two ideas I have would be very heads-on against established players. I’d risk my capital. Alternatively, take time off and find other ideas (how to best go about it?)<p>4.)

law school, I created oregonlaws.org which makes the Oregon Revised Statutes (the &quot;laws&quot;) much easier to read and link to. It&#x27;s very popular, and it serves its audience well even though it&#x27;s a &quot;.org&quot; because 99% of visitors enter via web search to a leaf node page. They don&#x27;t type the domain name. People in Oregon call the site, &quot;Oregon Laws&quot;. So I think it&#x27;s important that each state site have some identity, and not be generic.<p>Now I&#x27;m making instances for the rest of the U.S. states, and some foreign countries. And I&#x27;m unsure about how to use domains for this &quot;version 2&quot;. SEO is very important to this project. And so I may be overthinking the domain name strategy, but I want to avoid pitfalls. I&#x27;ve come up with these ideas:<p>* Since oregonlaws.org is a success, I can follow that example and register a unique name for every jurisdiction, whatever&#x27;s available. E.g., `virginialaw.online`, `washingtonlaws.org`, etc.<p>* Come up with a new app name and use sub-paths for each jurisdiction. I prototyped that route with `weblaws.org`. I.e., `weblaws.org&#x2F;newyork&#x2F;law...`<p>* Use a new app name and sub-domains for each geographical area. This is what I&#x27;m currently going with. I registered `public.law`. The &quot;.law&quot; domain is restricted to attorney&#x2F;law-firm use. I see this as a good thing. And so I&#x27;m prototyping e.g., `newyork.public.law`.<p>Generally, a person at one of these geographical&#x2F;jurisdiction sites will never want to see info from another. Although, in the future, I will add cross-area search.<p>The tension for me is e.g. Paul Graham&#x27;s advice to always use a .com: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;name.html<p>Also, the decision to use subdomains might negatively impact SEO.<p>Thanks for any feedback!","time":1522372305,"title":"Ask HN: Domain name strategy when expanding a regional app?","type":"story"},{"by":"smacktoward","descendants":2,"id":16712702,"kids":[16712825,16712739],"score":17,"time":1522371161,"title":"“I found a hard drive in my garage with the original Reddit Lisp code from 2005”","type":"story","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8830oa/and_now_a_word_from_reddits_engineers/dwhg6vi/"},{"by":"JumpCrisscross","descendants":32,"id":16712719,"kids":[16713669,16717363,16714454,16714432,16715106,16715896,16714781,16713407],"score":125,"time":1522371309,"title":"Facebook-Linked Marketer Acxiom Plunges After Policy Shift","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-29/facebook-linked-marketer-plunges-as-policy-shift-may-sap-profit"},{"by":"mkempe","descendants":5,"id":16712684,"kids":[16715316,16712925],"score":15,"time":1522371002,"title":"Toyota executive: Self-driving cars could kill 100s but save tens of thousands","type":"story","url":"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2018/03/29/self-driving-cars-uber-crash-toyota/468804002/"},{"by":"aetherson","descendants":3,"id":16712564,"kids":[16712570,16712602,16712655],"score":6,"time":1522369783,"title":"Authorize.net rejects customer emails containing “+”","type":"story","url":"https://community.developer.authorize.net/t5/Integration-and-Testing/Create-Customer-Profile-requests-with-emails-containing-a-symbol/m-p/62394"},{"by":"tysone","descendants":141,"id":16712574,"kids":[16712982,16712912,16713283,16713059,16713443,16713004,16712978,16713024,16713394,16713036,16713313,16713522,16713013,16713413,16714257,16713122,16713703,16713372],"score":103,"time":1522369877,"title":"Tesla Looked Like the Future, Now Some Ask If It Has One","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/business/tesla-elon-musk.html"},{"by":"sabanasa","descendants":5,"id":16712196,"kids":[16712468,16714089,16712317],"score":13,"time":1522366204,"title":"Delivering world-class healthcare to everyone by using blockchain","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@gliabase/using-blockchain-to-save-lives-and-deliver-world-class-healthcare-to-third-world-countries-df81c07ad21c"},{"by":"mudil","descendants":74,"id":16712179,"kids":[16712363,16712495,16712589,16712392,16712945,16715687,16713400,16712872,16712590,16714004],"score":133,"time":1522365978,"title":"Walmart in Early-Stage Acquisition Talks with Humana","type":"story","url":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/walmart-in-early-stage-acquisition-talks-with-humana-1522365618"},{"by":"fagnerbrack","descendants":3,"id":16712151,"kids":[16713420,16713281,16713497,16722274],"score":60,"time":1522365755,"title":"How React Increased Animation Performance Using Fiber","type":"story","url":"https://engineering.hexacta.com/didact-fiber-incremental-reconciliation-b2fe028dcaec"},{"by":"blondie9x","descendants":156,"id":16712038,"kids":[16713751,16713918,16713831,16713463,16714840,16713902,16714092,16713848,16717128,16715418,16713924,16715642,16713759,16714592,16715743],"score":124,"time":1522364768,"title":"E.P.A.

They all turn me down.<p>Half of them are judgmental turn-downs - they won&#x27;t return my call and never get back to me, because they think poorly of me.<p>Half are policy - Goldman Sachs made me an offer last month, but withdrew it this morning due to their policy against hiring felons.<p>I only have enough money to last us through April, and that&#x27;s literally because our local parish gave us a $1,000 check out of nowhere, which adds to what&#x27;s left over from our tax return.<p>I&#x27;m a hard worker with a wife and 5 kids to support.

This was the second offense (the other was years ago). They are inexcusable and disgusting offenses, but they are permanently on my background.<p>EDIT #1: my crime was in 4 local major newspapers, and all 4 online news articles show up when you google my name, so hiding my background is not really a possibility here. About 4 months ago, a small local software firm, which would have been an amazing job, said &quot;I know you said you&#x27;re looking for 70k, but we&#x27;d like to offer you 75k&quot;, and I asked them to give me a few days to think it over, which he was happy to do.

I&#x27;m quite skillful in several languages&#x2F;fields within Computer Science, and have taken a few products from concept to production as a technical lead. I hate to sound like I&#x27;m bragging - I don&#x27;t mean to. I just want to set the stage a bit.\nI&#x27;m 18 now and I&#x27;m in my first year of college. I love Computer Science: my only hobby is programming, and I love doing it professionally. However my career has always been in between school. At first middle school, then high school, and now college. Each step gives me more free time to work, which is great. Over the summers and during breaks I work a normal 9-5. And I love it. Even after a 90 minute commute each way each day, for months during the hot summers, I love what I do at work and I find developing new technologies is always exciting. But thats in between school. I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that most classes are just incompatible with my personality. For whatever irrational reason, when I&#x27;m forced to learn something (as opposed to learning it on my own terms), even a subject which I love dearly, becomes a drudgery for me. Tests make me dread even thinking about a subject, and when I inevitably (no matter how hard I study) get a poor test grade, it makes me despise the subject entirely until the feelings from the class subside and I can develop my own joy for the subject again.<p>And of course, there&#x27;s the money. However I make a pretty serious salary at my current job. If I was able to work full time, I&#x27;d be earning ~$100k&#x2F;yr. College however, is ~$55k&#x2F;yr. If I had to take out student loans it wouldn&#x27;t even be a question for me, however my parents are paying for college.<p>So HN, help me out here. Is it worth staying in college?

I&#x27;m curious if it&#x27;s possible to build a startup that tries to eradicate this problem in the most efficient way possible that is <i>not</i> non-profit. Or does something like this already exist?<p>I know that the city is spending $241m&#x2F;year to try to tackle the problem. However, as I understand it most of the funds go toward providing housing for the homeless. This might seem counter-intuitive, but I don&#x27;t think providing housing today is the best long-term solution. I think the best solution would be to do everything we can to enable the homeless to start generating money for themselves again. The fundamental problem arises because the healthcare and social welfare system are so bad in the US on a federal level (and not primarily because of the increasing housing prices in SF, like many think it is). But I think we can build a for-profit, hyperlocal system that helps a city&#x27;s population.<p>I also don&#x27;t think that non-profits are the solution. With non-profits, often there is no pressure to make the best possible product because income is only loosely coupled with how good the product is.<p>Unlike other social causes, this is something that touches SF residents every day and makes their lives worse. This may sound harsh, but it&#x27;s the reality. And therefore I think people would pay even they have zero altruistic tendencies.<p>How would I solve this issue and is it possible to get enough subscribers to tackle this issue quickly?

It&#x27;s been a terrific experience in general, except for one issue: dating.<p>South Bay gender ratio is <i>heavily</i> skewed towards men. It was virtually impossible to meet single young women anywhere near Mountain View. After several fruitless months I started looking all the way up in San Francisco, and when I finally scored a first date there, the lady told me she&#x27;s been out with five different men over the past 10 days, two of whom were millionaire startup entrepreneurs.<p>As the years went by, the dating scene seemed to only get worse, until it ended up being a major factor in my decision to leave the area. I relocated to the East Coast, which was a step down from the technological epicenter of Silicon Valley, but a <i>huge</i> step up dating-wise. I got a lot of dates with attractive young women who seemed genuinely happy to date me.<p>Fast-forward five years. An old co-worker recently reached out about a senior engineering role at a new startup he co-founded. I flew in to meet the rest of the team and they&#x27;re all incredibly talented. The issued a formal offer and it looks like an amazing opportunity. However, I am very concerned about getting back to the dating scene there.

This is a different level of scrutiny, and while I&#x27;m confident the principle of open-sourcing my code is sound, I&#x27;m not so confident if the code itself will live up to the reputation of the services it provides.<p>Any thoughts?","time":1521815241,"title":"Ask HN: Embarrassed to open-source code because of code quality?","type":"story"},{"by":"dgacmu","descendants":120,"id":16658400,"kids":[16659853,16659120,16662574,16661893,16661149,16658740,16658839,16661302,16662529,16659040,16659475,16663830,16659355,16658709,16659673,16663699,16659420,16662629,16661433,16661894,16664520,16661763,16659483,16658668,16667851,16671546,16659435,16671011,16663187,16658706],"score":471,"time":1521814781,"title":"Listening for illegal logging chainsaws using TensorFlow","type":"story","url":"https://www.blog.google/topics/machine-learning/fight-against-illegal-deforestation-tensorflow/"},{"by":"Mononokay","descendants":74,"id":16658399,"kids":[16659270,16659494,16662535,16659952,16661373,16663492,16664626,16660863,16662802,16659269,16662907,16661247,16659363,16662881,16662783,16659108,16663906],"score":206,"time":1521814767,"title":"Largest Animal Study on Cell Tower Radiation Confirms Cancer Link","type":"story","url":"http://www.sbwire.com/press-releases/worlds-largest-animal-study-on-cell-tower-radiation-confirms-cancer-link-953696.htm"},{"by":"VuongN","descendants":4,"id":16658310,"kids":[16660462,16658617],"score":13,"time":1521814219,"title":"Tech Friends, Let's Get Rid of Workplace Bullies","type":"story","url":"http://www.vuongnguyen.com/tech-friends-lets-get-rid-of-workplace-bullies/"},{"by":"zaphodq42","descendants":7,"id":16658339,"kids":[16659748,16664149,16689572,16659725],"score":6,"text":"We have been using Google App Engine flexible for our backend since Feb 17. In Jan 18 we started getting 502 errors because of an issue in the load balancer. This issue was internal to GCP, our code was not at fault.<p>When the issue first appeared we were using the free support plan. To raise a support ticket I upgraded to silver plan which costs USD150&#x2F;month. I explained my issue in detail that we have not changed anything at our end and suddenly 502 errors have appeared. It took me 15 days and a lot of back and forth emails to get an answer from GCP support. They gave a mysterious answer that there is an issue at GCP&#x27;s end and they will reply back when it gets resolved. No ETA, no workaround, no information on why it happened.<p>I gave a lot of thought about moving to Heroku but it being so closed and locked in didn&#x27;t feel right. AWS needs devops to keep it going. For our other app we have been using app engine standard without issues for 3 years, so I decided to go along with GAE for the time being. The issue got resolved in by Feb 1st week.<p>Today on 23rd March 502 errors appeared suddenly. I decided to speak to tech support. To do this I had to upgrade to gold support which costs USD400&#x2F;month. I spoke to a support staff who said he doesn&#x27;t have any information on this issue and I will get a reply back in 24hrs. No other reponse or help was provided.<p>I have finally decided to move away from GCP. Getting errors suddenly for 15 days and no workaround is too dangerous.\nAnd the support is too hard to get. Google it seems will always stay away from human interaction. They just don&#x27;t want to deal with people directly. Getting support is hard.<p>I need help from the community to suggest some other managed services.

Name it and I&#x27;ll see if I can do it. Prices of games will be anywhere from $0.05 to $0.25 per hour, depending on the required resources. Minecraft, for example, is $0.25&#x2F;h because of it&#x27;s heavy memory requirements.

I started off with everything on Linode using 4 separate application servers to manage everything. After a suggestion from an old work colleague I made the switch to AWS and Docker which has made things an order of magnitude simpler! I managed to dump about half of my existing codebase and drop all but one application server because of the switch to AWS.<p>I&#x27;d love to answer some questions about the tech stack I&#x27;m using if anyone&#x27;s interested.

My goal more or less is to become good at bug hunting and maybe someday develop useful defensive security software.","time":1521676692,"title":"Ask HN: Coding choices for a security professional","type":"story"},{"by":"paulashbourne","descendants":4,"id":16643491,"kids":[16643838,16643990,16644011,16643904,16643935,16643954,16643955,16643841],"score":86,"time":1521675217,"title":"Police Release Video of Fatal Uber Autonomous Car Collision","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-21/police-release-video-of-fatal-uber-autonomous-car-collision"},{"by":"mindprince","descendants":50,"id":16643461,"kids":[16644334,16644091,16643772,16644397,16645027,16643972,16646035,16646247,16645747,16649737,16647640,16643719,16650946,16646482,16643673,16648966,16655566,16648296],"score":179,"time":1521674975,"title":"Google Cloud Armor","type":"story","url":"https://cloud.google.com/armor/"},{"by":"paulashbourne","descendants":2,"id":16643439,"kids":[16645055,16643740],"score":10,"time":1521674786,"title":"Tempe Police release fatal Uber crash video","type":"story","url":"https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2018/03/21/tempe-police-release-fatal-uber-crash-video.html"},{"by":"samstave","descendants":2,"id":16643367,"kids":[16645700,16644381],"score":3,"text":"When you are raising a seed&#x2F;angel round - what are the do-s don’t-s for a seed round?","time":1521674203,"title":"Ask HN: How do you structure a seed round?","type":"story"},{"by":"prostoalex","descendants":4,"id":16643306,"kids":[16645983,16645658,16645664,16645939],"score":20,"time":1521673716,"title":"Jack Dorsey believes Bitcoin will be the world’s sole currency within 10 years","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/21/bitcoin-jack-dorsey-quote-single-currency/"},{"by":"danso","descendants":7,"id":16643308,"kids":[16643851,16643433,16643429],"score":28,"time":1521673732,"title":"Tempe Police posts video from March 18 Uber AV fatal accident","type":"story","url":"https://twitter.com/TempePolice/status/976585098542833664"},{"by":"losvedir","descendants":15,"id":16643191,"kids":[16644538,16645440,16643237,16647617,16643880,16645450,16644815,16644564],"score":31,"time":1521672737,"title":"New highly unpopular Reddit policy bans popular beer, cigar, and gun communities","type":"story","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/"},{"by":"sizzle","descendants":59,"id":16643176,"kids":[16644504,16646888,16644675,16643418,16645177,16644912,16644994,16644330,16646864,16647539,16645777,16644390,16644068],"score":96,"time":1521672595,"title":"Wyoming Passes Forward-Thinking Computer Science Education Bill","type":"story","url":"https://edscoop.com/wyoming-passes-forward-thinking-computer-science-education-bill"},{"by":"IronWolve","descendants":714,"id":16643040,"kids":[16643446,16647919,16643199,16643127,16646735,16646041,16643806,16646528,16647961,16647947,16643556,16643860,16648213,16647702,16649201,16645845,16645897,16647260,16647293,16649034,16646854,16643205,16650975,16661058,16656983,16643292,16647050,16649316,16649021,16661148,16650659,16647782,16650996,16647409,16646718,16648620,16648313,16647082,16647365,16648090,16648536,16648346,16649267,16647649,16644015,16648981,16646816,16657937,16655109,16648257,16647570],"score":448,"text":"Today Youtube has started to roll out bans on gun sales, accessories and howto channels.

The IRS is one of the most powerful and terrifying government agency, so I am having fears that may be unfounded.  I plan on talking to an tax authority of some sort, but wanted to get some feedback from the community who&#x27;ve been through this.<p>Here is my dilemma:<p>I have promising code I&#x27;d like to start trialing, but when I do the math, it only makes money assuming no taxes per trade, which I haven&#x27;t factored in.  That&#x27;s because I can&#x27;t grok the taxes, and how they will be calculated.<p>Given my naive understanding of how it is <i>supposed</i> work, it&#x27;s possible even though I might gain fractions of a bitcoin by end of day, I could owe the IRS thousands of dollars I didn&#x27;t make.<p>Here is a toy scenario (numbers are fake to keep it simple):<p>1) 10:00 am: 1.0 BTC -&gt; 1.1 LTC (trade 1 bitcoin for 1.1 litecoin)<p>2) 11:00 am: 1.1 LTC -&gt; 1.2 BTC<p>3) 12:00 pm: 1.2 BTC -&gt; 1.3 LTC<p>If the value of BTC, is <i></i>$1000 at 10 am<i></i>, then rises  to <i></i>$2000 at 12 pm<i></i>, that is a gain of $1000.  By buying the LTC at 12 pm, it seems I would owe taxes on the &quot;gain&quot; in BTC of <i>$1000</i>, even if I only gained 0.2 BTC ($400).  As I understand it, the taxes are owed based on the relative gain in <i>dollar value</i>, not on absolute <i>bitcoin gain</i>.<p>The taxes could easily wipe out any gains, or worse, cause me to owe money I didn’t make. I can’t decide whether even to  test the code, as I fear accidentally incurring a high tax bill.<p>1) Are my fears unfounded?<p>2) If I make thousands of these tiny trades per day, could I potentially owe more in dollars than I virtually gained, or am I seriously mistaken?<p>3) In practice, I’ll be trading other currencies too which are not traded against the dollar.

HN,<p>We are Phaedra and Diana of Promise (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;joinpromise.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;joinpromise.com&#x2F;</a>). We provide a cost-effective, more humane alternative to incarceration.<p>We work for government agencies to monitor and support individuals who would otherwise be in jail or who are under some form of community supervision.<p>There are almost 2.3 million people behind bars in the US and another 4.5+ million people on probation or parole. Almost 450,000 people are in jails pretrial, meaning they have not been convicted of the crime for which they were arrested. The majority of these individuals remain in custody because they cannot afford to pay for their release. This is costly for governments and devastating for the individuals who remain in jail who can lose their job, housing, children and more while incarcerated. Believe it or not, many of these people never even end up being charged with or convicted of a crime.<p>Phaedra had a background in politics (she ran the South Bay Labor Council) and Diana had a background in law (as a criminal defense attorney and co-founder of the Ella Baker Center). We then worked together at a non-profit (Green For All), in the music industry (for the musician Prince) and in technology (at Honor). We decided to start Promise because we saw a huge need for innovation in the criminal justice system and wanted to use what we had learned in tech to build something that actually helps change lives for the better and can scale.<p>Here&#x27;s how Promise works: We work in partnership with governments who release people from jail on condition that they work with Promise as an alternative to being in custody. We also provide support to people under community supervision. We use an intake assessment to create an individualized plan that is based on the risks and needs of each participant. We provide each participant with an app and a wearable tracking device (only when required). Our goal is to always use the least restrictive means necessary and to use a step-up, step-down approach: that is, we reduce restrictions when possible and increase only when needed. While there are still restrictions on freedom, participants will no longer be in custody so that they can return to their jobs, families, and communities until their case is resolved or they no longer have any required supervision.<p>We then monitor and support participants to help them succeed with their plans. We provide an intelligent calendar of their obligations (court appearances, drug testing, substance abuse treatment, etc.) and adaptive reminders to help them meet these obligations. Research and experience have shown that simple intervention like this does work: for example, it makes people more likely to get to court. We also provide referrals and support so participants can receive services that may help (job training&#x2F;placement, housing, counseling, etc.). We provide reports to courts or other involved parties as needed. We also allow the participants to easily view their upcoming obligations, overall plan and progress on their plan.<p>We believe this approach can support participants&#x27; needs, keep communities safer, and provide a cost-effective and more humane alternative to incarceration in the US. Our business model is simple: we charge governments a fee. Incarceration is so expensive that we can make a profit and still save governments—and ultimately tax payers—money.<p>We would love to get feedback on Promise and in particular to hear about your ideas and experiences in this area, whether working in government agencies, selling to such agencies or as individuals who have been impacted by this system. There is a huge amount of work to be done here!<p>Thank you!!","time":1521569000,"title":"Launch HN: Promise (YC W18) – Cost-effective, more humane alternative to jail","type":"story"},{"by":"crazyoscarchang","descendants":25,"id":16630828,"kids":[16631750,16631020,16633130,16632134,16633496,16635908],"score":138,"time":1521568059,"title":"Neural Network Quine","type":"story","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05859"},{"by":"dlgeek","descendants":3,"id":16630811,"kids":[16630988,16631801],"score":11,"time":1521567942,"title":"Operator of self-driving Uber vehicle that killed pedestrian was felon","type":"story","url":"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/03/20/operator-self-driving-uber-vehicle-killed-pedestrian-felon/441051002/"},{"by":"tzury","dead":true,"id":16630760,"kids":[16630840,16630836],"score":7,"time":1521567620,"title":"Elon Musk Secretly Visits Jerusalem to See Israeli Self-Driving Car Technology","type":"story","url":"http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking-news/report-elon-musk-secretly-visits-jerusalem-to-see-israeli-self-driving-car-technology/2016/03/30/"},{"by":"billpg","descendants":38,"id":16630748,"kids":[16630885,16631128,16631164,16631089,16636010,16634661,16631102,16631535,16633679,16634599,16633913],"score":98,"time":1521567574,"title":"Online flag waver","type":"story","url":"https://krikienoid.github.io/flagwaver/"},{"by":"carv-io","descendants":4,"id":16630722,"kids":[16630846,16631929,16631239],"score":2,"text":"We have a stable alpha SaaS product, but our warm customer leads are saying they won&#x27;t sign up until X feature is in place.

can use Facebook to connect with other people.

In such a case, the user himself approves sharing his data on Facebook with the app. This is what happened in the case of Cambridge Analytica. Users used a 3rd party app which collected data. They voluntarily did it. The app then shared it with Cambridge Analytica. The app developer got data from users and used it in ways he didn&#x27;t disclose to his users.<p>Facebook makes close to no money from these third party apps. I have written apps in the past which ended up collecting user information which just sits in my database.

I have been applying for entry level positions all over the place for nearly a year and have had very little interest back. It wouldn&#x27;t be half as bad if I had a stack of rejections, but the vast majority of positions don&#x27;t even respond and checking back on their career sites just says &quot;accepting applicants&quot; after months.<p>I&#x27;m not even sure if it&#x27;s a remotely good idea or not, but I&#x27;ve taken the rather drastic step of booking a plane ticket to Santa Clara, with the intent of wandering around for two weeks and trying to talk to actual people at some of the companies headquartered there, the likes of Intel, GlobalFoundaries, Applied Materials, LAM Research etc and trying to hand off some CVs. As I said, it might be a terrible idea and I might end up wasting a whole lot of money being escorted out of buildings by security for two weeks, but I&#x27;m hoping that by making myself available to talk to, it might help me get past that first hurdle of being Johnny Foreigner.<p>Just wondering if there&#x27;s anyone here working in the area who might have either some advice or even a contact I can ask for at any of the semiconductor companies in Santa Clara?","time":1521499151,"title":"Semiconductor job hunting trip to Santa Clara","type":"story"},{"by":"cppdesign","descendants":10,"id":16623794,"kids":[16624027,16624182,16624036,16624096],"score":35,"time":1521497934,"title":"What made John Carmack a legend in C++ programming?","type":"story","url":"http://cppdepend.com/blog/?p=744"},{"by":"aaronbrethorst","descendants":395,"id":16623835,"kids":[16623965,16624607,16623890,16624115,16623981,16624290,16624057,16624098,16623926,16623914,16625807,16624375,16625833,16624405,16624178,16624936,16623964,16623885,16623948,16623908,16624395,16624002,16626406,16624475,16625053,16624390,16624764,16625350,16624364,16624542,16624373,16624406,16624424,16625205,16624799,16627071,16625165,16623893,16624370,16624550,16630080,16623895,16624578,16625572,16624829,16624943,16624476,16626281,16625462,16627943,16625441,16624025,16627279,16624601,16624961,16624062],"score":1074,"time":1521498221,"title":"Facebook Security Chief Said to Leave After Clashes Over Disinformation","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/facebook-alex-stamos.html"},{"by":"TwoFactor","descendants":3,"id":16623664,"kids":[16623762,16627404],"score":18,"time":1521497068,"title":"NYC hotel wants to use a $400M cryptocoin offering to sell ownership like stock","type":"story","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/19/kevin-oleary-new-york-city-hotel-hopes-to-launch-400-million-dollar-coin-offering.html"},{"by":"rsweeney21","descendants":36,"id":16623641,"kids":[16635017,16624622,16623799,16628801,16624084,16624199,16626500,16626828,16631335,16625950,16629031,16627579,16628381,16633192,16624166,16630744,16624539,16640528,16634148,16626429,16626846,16626644,16627063,16626997],"score":46,"text":"I thought this would get better with docker, but it seems to always be a multi-day process to get up and running.

HN,<p>My name is Cameron Sadler, and I&#x27;m one of the founders of TrapFi (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.trapfi.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.trapfi.com</a>). Our service makes it easy for freelance developers to get paid per pull request. Instead of waiting months after work is complete to get paid, freelance devs use us to generate payouts as they work.<p>Nigel, Eric and I have been freelancing on and off for the last five years. It was undoubtedly feast or famine. Late or slow payments from clients made this more difficult. With TrapFi you know precisely when you&#x27;ll get paid next.<p>Before TrapFi, I ran a co-work space for freelance developers. Here I connected with people who loved freelancing but eventually went back to corporate because cash flow was unpredictable. This was due to most of their contracts having net 30&#x2F;60&#x2F;90 terms or clients just flat out paying late (or not paying at all). We searched for tools to solve this problem, but none triggered payouts from clients automatically at the point of work approval.<p>Here&#x27;s how we solve this:<p>1. Freelancers add clients<p>2. Clients receive a project link where they can connect their bank and track pull request submissions in real-time<p>3. Freelancers complete work, submit a pull request and add an hours&#x27; tag (or flat rate) to the PR body (i.e. {TF10} for 10 hours)<p>4. As soon as the client or a repo admin approves your pull requests, we charge the client the amount specified by the tag<p>You can still bill clients for the non-code work that went into a PR using TrapFi&#x27;s tagging system. Your clients don&#x27;t have to do anything special to set up this process; they simply receive a link to pay and track the project. When you complete work and they approve it, you get paid automatically. It&#x27;s money you&#x27;ve earned, delivered instantly.<p>We also automatically generate invoices with line items that link to your PRs for you and your clients. You never have to leave git to get paid. Like most payment tools, we earn a % of each transaction (1.5%). We expect additional revenue to come from a marketplace, where we connect developers with solutions to developers who need work done.<p>We look forward to hearing feedback, ideas and experiences from the HN community. We know there are a lot of freelancers here so our goal is to learn from your experiences and knowledge of the freelance space.","time":1521478894,"title":"Launch HN: TrapFi (YC W18) pays freelance developers by the pull request","type":"story"},{"by":"_drew_","descendants":85,"id":16620016,"kids":[16620312,16620324,16623565,16620822,16620470,16621469,16620437,16639540,16620255,16620489],"score":112,"text":"With over 227 million active paypal accounts why is there seemingly no pressure on them to stop enforcing a password length limit?","time":1521478482,"title":"Ask HN: Why is PayPal's password length limit still a thing?","type":"story"},{"by":"chollida1","descendants":19,"id":16619963,"kids":[16620378,16620863,16623651,16620677,16621080,16623680,16620433,16621685],"score":75,"time":1521478305,"title":"Trump Issues Action Blocking Venezuelan Government Cryptocurrencies","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-19/trump-issues-action-blocking-venezuelan-government-cryptocurrencies"},{"by":"chmaynard","descendants":3,"id":16619994,"kids":[16626861,16625293],"score":24,"time":1521478403,"title":"MacOS Unified Log: why, what and how","type":"story","url":"https://eclecticlight.co/2018/03/19/macos-unified-log-1-why-what-and-how/"},{"by":"kgwgk","descendants":1766,"id":16619917,"kids":[16623308,16620170,16621507,16624133,16620241,16621164,16620057,16620042,16621505,16620024,16624910,16620092,16620801,16624001,16626272,16626094,16620971,16623089,16621615,16621519,16624321,16620056,16624104,16620829,16620609,16625025,16621207,16620421,16620590,16621601,16620497,16620059,16620368,16623044,16623831,16620301,16620266,16624871,16620105,16621577,16623139,16623875,16624452,16620125,16621667,16621724,16621447,16623679,16620558,16621932,16621144,16620722,16620087,16621809,16625430,16622239,16621876,16621070,16622494,16620173,16620817,16620580,16621866,16624156,16622481,16621603,16622056,16621816,16625582,16622472,16622894,16620951,16623451,16620211,16622500,16622486,16624454,16620322,16623159,16624263,16623199,16621140,16620127,16626346,16621970,16623226,16623587,16624207,16621512,16622857,16622409,16624048,16621384,16624026,16620557,16620859,16623103,16622991,16621356,16626499,16622655,16620392,16622374,16622885,16624546,16622499,16628853,16622338,16623601,16622628,16621362,16622165,16624854,16621982,16623614,16623109,16620086,16625998,16623631,16621805,16623206,16622794,16623387,16620029,16620760,16623755,16621335,16621773,16623726,16635707,16623418,16620725,16620021,16623809,16622482,16620698,16624655,16622796,16620692,16621111,16621959,16620132,16620862,16624515,16621361,16620417,16620376,16620100,16621223,16625596,16621426,16620436,16620886,16625099,16626437,16623187,16620418,16625388,16620435,16621027,16619936,16620156,16620260,16623747,16620361,16620532,16623502,16620345,16622196,16624890,16622177,16620045,16620037],"score":2361,"time":1521478042,"title":"Self-driving Uber car kills Arizona woman crossing street","type":"story","url":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-selfdriving-uber/self-driving-uber-car-kills-arizona-woman-crossing-street-idUSKBN1GV296"},{"by":"oneeyedpigeon","descendants":78,"id":16619857,"kids":[16619895,16620075,16620259,16619987,16620613,16620124,16620157,16624092,16620251,16621007,16620412,16620386,16620507,16666487,16627604,16627372,16620544,16622965,16625418],"score":81,"time":1521477714,"title":"Windows 10: Microsoft is looking to force people to use its Edge browser","type":"story","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/19/windows-10-microsoft-force-people-edge-browser-windows-mail-chrome-firefox"},{"by":"techsin101","descendants":3,"id":16619876,"kids":[16619986,16619900],"score":1,"text":"In DB migrations you write SQL statements so database can be modified to a new state.

A place where you — either by yourself or with a few friends — can broadcast to an audience. With a few friends, it reads like a conversation.<p>A few months ago, we wanted to create a music blog together. We started to look at our options for creating a music blog, and realized that there weren’t any good ones. We didn’t want to create our own website, because people would have to remember to visit our domain and wouldn’t get notified when we posted. We looked at other music blogs on the internet, but it seemed like most of them were dying or have already died. We wanted a place where we could both share and bounce music off each other, and have our friends subscribe. And we couldn’t find an easy way to do this. We realized that this same issue arises not just in music, but in many other areas.<p>So we created Rhythmm — a place where you can create a Slack-like channel that people can subscribe to. Do whatever you want with it.

Most of them have good things going for them but there hasn&#x27;t been a clear winner in the decade or so I have been playing with this.<p>So, I thought I would ask what people use and what you liked about it.","time":1521224679,"title":"Ask HN: Do you keep a personal knowledgebase?

Our product lets anyone create a cryptocurrency (an ERC20 token on Ethereum). You don&#x27;t sell it or do an ICO, you just create it and start using it right away. It&#x27;s supposed to be fun!<p>Cryptocurrency is still in a very experimental phase, but most cryptocurrencies out there seem aimed at a serious, large-scale technical problem (not to mention the get-rich-quick schemes). We&#x27;re helping people create currencies for interesting things they actually want to try using now.<p>So far, we&#x27;ve seen some cool use cases. To name a few:\nA gaming streamer is rewarding his most loyal viewers with tokens they can redeem for shoutouts or merchandise.\nA hip hop website is giving tokens to content curators and using them for giveaways.\nA few Discord channels have created tokens to use as a form of upvotes in their communities (and we think this could be cool for subreddits too).<p>We also provide tools for managing and tracking the token you make. This is free, but we plan to make money by charging for advanced features in the future. Right now on Hexel, you can do the following:<p>1.) Mint tokens and airdrop them to anyone with an Ethereum address<p>2.) Share a public page for your token, with information and a UI for sending that token to others<p>3.) Explore other tokens created on Hexel, subscribe to the ones you like, and request tokens from the creator<p>4.) Message your token&#x27;s subscribers with updates or info about things you&#x27;re doing with your token<p>5.) View a feed of payments made using your token<p>Although the ICO bandwagon and hype have left many people feeling cynical about cryptocurrencies (we feel that way ourselves), we&#x27;re optimistic that there are many more potential applications and cool use cases out there. Our goal is to widen the space, make it interesting again, and make other use cases easy to explore. We&#x27;d love for anyone to poke holes in the use cases you see on the site, and even better would be feedback on use cases were you think this could be really useful.

I&#x27;m the most senior person in my team (at 4 years of experience!!!) and for the past six months I&#x27;ve been doing nothing but writing documents, presentations and coaching junior devs (that&#x27;s actually the most enjoyable part). What contributes to me feeling burned out is the management micromanaging everything I do and undermining most of my decisions (even though they don&#x27;t have engineering background and and are quite open about not knowing much about technicalities). I brought those facts up to my manager attention lately but it didn&#x27;t change anything.<p>The only way I grow my technical skills is through learning at home or making side projects but I feel I can&#x27;t catch up properly with any technologies after hours.<p>I&#x27;ve been trying to find some alternative job but find it quite difficult because of language barrier, not having a CS degree and the fact that there are not many robotics companies in the area.

Piccolo is a smart camera that lets you control your TV, lamps, fans, speakers, and other devices with simple gestures. For example, you can point at your lamps with your hand to turn them on or off.<p>The two of us have had an interest in computer vision for a long time and were in Udacity’s first self-driving car nanodegree cohort in 2016. We started this as a side project to control one lamp and soon had our entire house connected. For some actions, we found gestures to be much faster and more intuitive. For example, pointing at a lamp to turn it on is way more natural than saying “Hey Alexa, can you turn on my left living room lamp?”<p>To set up Piccolo, you can place it anywhere (near the TV is usually best), and then on the app you can indicate with bounding boxes where the devices are. After that, you connect those same devices (Chromecast, Hue lights, smart plugs, etc.), and you’re good to go. Some processing happens on-device, but the more complicated models are run in the cloud. Since we’re not a security camera, there’s no need to store video and so no image&#x2F;video data is ever stored.<p>We’re excited about the experiences you can build when you have a camera and apply computer vision techniques. With recent progress in human pose estimation, object classification, and object tracking, there’s really a lot you can do. We’re starting out with gestures, but our goal is to build a platform that lets anyone create and deploy vision apps. Here&#x27;s a few things we&#x27;re excited about:<p>- New apps. For example an app that detects medical emergencies (like an elderly person falling). We&#x27;d also love an app that can tell you where you left your phone and keys.<p>- App integrations. For example, letting Netflix know which people are in the room to get tailored recommendations for everyone vs. just the person signed in.<p>- Smarter hardware. For example, an Espresso machine that, with one click, makes your favorite drink because it knows who pressed the button.<p>- Voice-vision fusion. You should be able to trigger Alexa just by gazing at the Alexa device instead of saying &quot;Alexa&quot;. You should also be able to hold something and say &quot;Order 5 more of these&quot;.<p>We&#x27;re giving away 20 pre-release units next month to anyone that joins the waitlist. We’re happy to answer any questions and look forward to your feedback.

We also like to employ forking in some software implementations.<p>I love to hear what your stories are.","time":1521051545,"title":"Ask HN: Why and from/to what VCS did you switch?","type":"story"},{"by":"manol74","descendants":2,"id":16587013,"kids":[16587067,16589750],"score":2,"time":1521051479,"title":"Why Is the Cyber Security Industry Addicted to Marketing?","type":"story","url":"http://petercohen.me/cyber-security-industry-addicted-marketing/"},{"by":"oicu812","descendants":62,"id":16587072,"kids":[16588552,16587367,16587528,16587927,16587513,16591136,16587819,16588065,16588609,16588955,16591657,16591793,16587795],"score":69,"time":1521051823,"title":"Navy Medics Get Prepared for Combat with Tour of Duty in Chicago","type":"story","url":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/navy-medics-get-prepared-for-combatwith-tour-of-duty-in-chicago-1521028800"},{"by":"kkoehncke","descendants":5,"id":16586907,"kids":[16587162,16587133],"score":21,"time":1521050845,"title":"Microsoft translates Chinese to English with the same accuracy as a person","type":"story","url":"https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai/machine-translation-news-test-set-human-parity/?wt.mc_id=74788-mcr-fb&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=referral"},{"by":"ChrisSD","descendants":77,"id":16586939,"kids":[16587754,16587712,16587644,16590109,16590064,16588148,16589675,16589829,16588799,16588724,16588468,16588614,16587740,16588601,16590110],"score":105,"time":1521051073,"title":"Fallout 3 in Fallout 4 mod cancelled due to voice acting copyright","type":"story","url":"https://capitalwasteland.com/#cancellation-announcement-section"},{"by":"radicaldreamer","descendants":18,"id":16586872,"kids":[16587897,16588097,16587527,16589377],"score":70,"time":1521050583,"title":"First Detection of the 21cm Cosmic Dawn Signal","type":"story","url":"https://astrobites.org/2018/03/14/first-detection-of-the-21cm-cosmic-dawn-signal/"},{"by":"ingve","descendants":182,"id":16586811,"kids":[16587174,16587659,16587043,16588110,16587275,16587325,16587417,16587170,16588053,16590090,16590094,16591168,16589936,16594050,16587448],"score":361,"time":1521050184,"title":"Key Git Concepts Explained the Hard Way","type":"story","url":"https://zwischenzugs.com/2018/03/14/five-key-git-concepts-explained-the-hard-way/"},{"by":"bthornbury","descendants":35,"id":16586613,"kids":[16595695,16586685,16596352,16595924,16595561,16596896],"score":41,"time":1521048950,"title":"Show HN: Coherence API – Modern Serverless Code.

Pathrise is an online replacement for career services that helps students get better jobs and make more money. If and only if they get hired during our program, students pay us back a tuition fee of 7% of their income for 1 year.<p>For more context, you can read about us here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;venturebeat.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;09&#x2F;pathrise-wants-to-be-the-y-combinator-for-tech-students&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;venturebeat.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;09&#x2F;pathrise-wants-to-be-the-...</a>.<p>The problem: universities aren&#x27;t directly incentivized to get students good jobs since they make all their money in upfront tuition. As a result, college career services centers aren&#x27;t results-driven and can&#x27;t properly support their students. Most students are essentially left to figure things out on their own, and they think to themselves, career services are useless. The easiest way to verify this is to ask your average student how many times they&#x27;ve visited their career services center in the last year.<p>In reality, career services (that actually work) are probably one of the highest value things a student can receive. You can take any step of the job search (e.g. online applications), train students on one technique (e.g. lead gen and cold emailing), and produce significant and measurable returns (e.g. we&#x27;ve measured that this technique in particular can 4X response rate from under 5% to over 20%). Pathrise does this with every step of the job-hunting process, from training students from a 2&#x2F;6 to a 5&#x2F;6 in technical interviewing scores based on real company rubrics to helping students get a 10%+ higher salary through negotiation.<p>In this sense, we&#x27;re kind of like YC for students instead of startups. Founders give 7% equity to YC because they know YC will increase their company&#x27;s prospects by more than 7%. Students give us 7% of their first year&#x27;s income, and our program is designed to increase their job prospects by more than 7%. They know we&#x27;ll do everything in our power to provide them that value because we have aligned incentives - we only make money if they do.<p>What this ends up looking like is an online accelerator for students that takes place in 12 monthly batches a year, followed by an average of 3-4 months of support until a student is placed. Instead of focusing on a technical education (like our friends at Lambda School), Pathrise is entirely about optimizing your job search. This involves services like resume review, prospecting, referrals, interview preparation, and negotiation advice. Again, unlike career services today, we track every data point so we can hold ourselves accountable to actually produce significant and measurable value for our students.<p>Thanks for reading! I&#x27;d be happy to answer any of your questions and would greatly appreciate your feedback.","time":1521046927,"title":"Launch HN: Pathrise (YC W18) – Career accelerator for students, free until hired","type":"story"},{"by":"arthur2e5","descendants":33,"id":16586257,"kids":[16586599,16588533,16587216,16589307,16586805,16591182,16589990],"score":149,"time":1521046947,"title":"LC4: A Low-Tech Authenticated Cipher for Human-To-Human Communication","type":"story","url":"https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/339"},{"by":"abeaclark","descendants":24,"id":16586198,"kids":[16586345,16586327,16586320,16586288,16586291,16586389,16586297,16586348,16586312,16587582,16586305],"score":15,"time":1521046593,"title":"TechCrunch redesign is terrible","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/13/welcome-to-the-new-techcrunch/"},{"by":"justin66","descendants":24,"id":16586132,"kids":[16591836,16589216,16589802,16590754,16591132,16594167],"score":60,"time":1521046244,"title":"A Reporter Rolled Her Eyes, and China’s Internet Broke","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/world/asia/china-eye-roll-liang-xiangyi.html"},{"by":"searchencrypt","descendants":3,"id":16586022,"kids":[16586043,16586034,16586046],"score":11,"text":"Is there a CSS issue going on, or is this an intentional design change?","time":1521045699,"title":"What is the black bar at the top of Hacker News?","type":"story"},{"by":"seanieb","descendants":1,"id":16586011,"kids":[16586161,16586019],"score":5,"time":1521045644,"title":"SEC charges former Equifax CIO with insider trading related to last years breach","type":"story","url":"https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-40"},{"by":"twosheep","descendants":2,"id":16585932,"kids":[16586169,16586070],"score":18,"time":1521045095,"title":"Theranos charged with fraud [pdf]","type":"story","url":"https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2018/comp-pr2018-41-theranos-holmes.pdf"},{"by":"kgwgk","descendants":517,"id":16585892,"kids":[16586067,16587656,16585944,16586241,16587630,16587281,16588114,16588546,16587817,16585956,16590938,16587807,16587173,16586303,16586753,16588296,16586367,16586526,16586395,16587016,16586458,16586073,16585963,16585958,16586446,16588225,16588451,16586036,16587010,16586020,16586334,16586125,16588277,16589198,16586247,16586470,16588382,16587634,16587244,16590161,16586532,16591079,16592607,16586197,16588006,16588628,16587901,16588108,16586552,16588096,16589684,16586082,16586403,16587060,16589843,16587688,16598608,16585992,16585952,16586047,16587899,16589761,16586092,16586166,16586237,16588307,16587591,16586631,16587126,16588059],"score":1211,"time":1521044797,"title":"Theranos, CEO Holmes, and Former President Balwani Charged with Fraud","type":"story","url":"https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-41"},{"by":"jonwachob91","dead":true,"id":16585939,"kids":[16586159,16586178,16586162],"score":11,"time":1521045163,"title":"SEC Charges Theranos Founder Elizabeth Holmes with Fraud","type":"story","url":"http://nordic.businessinsider.com/theranos-ceo-elizabeth-holmes-fraud-charge-sec-2018-3/"},{"by":"zabana","descendants":11,"id":16585770,"kids":[16588706,16586442,16589255,16587406,16592383,16587301,16591407,16598133,16590810],"score":12,"text":"If so, how were you able to get by ?

HN!<p>We’re Fil, Lambert and Matt, the founders of EasyEmail (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;easyemail.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;easyemail.ai</a>). EasyEmail is a Gmail plug-in that helps you write emails quickly. We train our software with your inbox and quickly suggest what you should write based on your previous responses.<p>We started working on improving how email is used about a year and a half ago, when Fil was organizing the MIT Fall Career Fair, an event for 6,000 people and 450 companies. He was sending 200-300 emails a day and feeling suffocated by the volume. We started chatting about some sort of a solution, and after a long journey (including a car crash on the way to our YC interview!) we finally have a working product and some happy users.<p>Our current product is a Chrome Extension helps you write emails with\ntwo main components: autocomplete, and hotkeys.<p>Autocomplete searches through every sentence you’ve ever sent in the past and suggests 5 sentences you might say at this moment. An example could be me typing “how a” and the autocomplete suggesting “How are you doing?” together with 4 other sentences. This feature turned out to be harder than we expected because users say things that start similarly a lot (I have 207 unique sentences starting with “how a”). The question is how to sort all those sentences so they’re most likely to choose one of the top 5. Our sentence-matching algorithm includes things like frequency, recency, and context from the email you’re replying to.<p>Hotkeys are a quick way to enter snippets of text that you repeat a lot, but that aren’t sentences, like a link that you send a lot, or pieces of text that you send often but don’t merit a new template.<p>It’s very exciting to work on this problem, because email is so universal. That also makes it very hard, because we need to satisfy a lot of different email users. There&#x27;s also a lot of competition - most prominent is probably SmartReply by Gmail (those 3 buttons saying “sounds good” on your mobile app). The most important difference between us and them is that our suggestions are always personalized, since they come from your own mailbox.<p>This may sound like we’re trying to remove thoughtful emailing by just making our users repeat the same sentences over and over again, but that’s the exact opposite of what we’re going for. Our initial users tend to already send repetitive emails, and we’re just reducing the amount of typing they have to do. The goal is to give everyone more time to put into the non-repetitive parts of emails!<p>We’d absolutely love to hear your thoughts on the product and your experiences in this area. If you’d like to try out our product, it’s easier to go right away to the Chrome webstore: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;easyemail-ai&#x2F;giagehiaomegelcgdpihbdjihofogede\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;easyemail-ai&#x2F;giage...</a>.

EnvKey is an end-to-end encrypted 1Password-like service that lets dev teams manage API keys, credentials, and configuration easily and securely.<p>For some background, you can check out <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;02&#x2F;27&#x2F;envkey-wants-to-create-a-smarter-place-to-store-a-companys-api-keys-and-credentials&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;02&#x2F;27&#x2F;envkey-wants-to-create-a-s...</a> as well as a Show HN from when EnvKey first launched: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=15330757\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=15330757</a>. The Show HN is what got EnvKey its first batch of production users, and I probably wouldn’t have gotten into YC without it. So thanks HN! I owe a hell of a lot to this community.<p>On where the idea came from: I had the first inklings at my last job. We were in the MVP stage, so we ended up with a bunch of separate apps and services as we experimented. These were split between CloudFoundry and Heroku, and we also had an in-house test server running CI for everything on TeamCity. Keeping stuff like API keys, puma server settings, and other environment-specific config in sync everywhere was a serious headache. Bugs and failed CI builds due to missing keys were common, and our Slack quickly filled up with requests for API keys and .env files. We knew this wasn’t secure, but there didn’t seem to be any solution out there that was worth the additional complexity it would introduce.<p>One day while wrangling with TeamCity build variables, I had the thought that this could all be so much easier. Why were we painstakingly copying big blocks of config from one place to another? It was like dealing with code pre-source control. And sure, our secrets were out of git, but was spraying them all over Slack and email any better? That night, I started typing out some notes for an &#x27;Env Vars Locker&#x27; service that would use PGP and environment variables to solve this issue in a minimalistic way.<p>A bit later, I left that job to do something on my own. After a false start with a different idea, I decided that the &#x27;Env Vars Locker&#x27; had potential. I did a round of problem interviews, and people were enthusiastic. It seemed like almost every team had this issue, and it only got worse as companies grew.<p>6 months later, I had a working beta and some early users. 6 months after that, EnvKey officially launched. Now we have many customers using it happily in production. It’s growing rapidly, and lots of new features are in the pipeline.<p>So that’s the backstory. Now for the good stuff: how it works.<p>With EnvKey, configuring any development or server environment becomes as simple as setting a single environment variable(ENVKEY=F4U4jGkZuo24zKxxgJsR-4f1g2w3VpHYpYC2x). It lets you edit configuration and set access levels for all your company’s apps, environments, and teams in one place with a user-friendly, cross-platform desktop ui.<p>It keeps developers and servers in sync securely and automatically so that people don’t resort to sharing secrets over email, Slack, git, spreadsheets, etc. (a serious security risk, even with &#x27;development&#x27; secrets, since the line here is fuzzy). It also removes a whole class of config-related bugs, simplifies updates and secrets rotation, and prevents developers from interrupting each other or getting blocked when they don’t have the latest config.<p>Our servers are not trusted by any EnvKey client and cannot read or modify encrypted configuration (apart from deleting it). Public keys are verified by a web of trust during every crypto operation, and no third party gets access when you invite a new user to the system. The crypto is all vanilla OpenPGP, and all clients are fully open source. The security details are documented here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;security.envkey.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;security.envkey.com</a><p>Apart from the cloud service, we&#x27;re also working on an on-prem version and a hybrid option that will allow you to store the encrypted config in your own S3 account without having it ever touch our servers.<p>For reliability, we run a high availability Kubernetes cluster on AWS, and also back up encrypted config to S3 in a separate region on every update. If any of the client libraries can’t load from the server for any reason, they’ll fail over directly to S3 (you wouldn’t even notice).<p>Unlike other tools that require heavy lifting on the ops side and complex integrations, EnvKey typically takes less than 15 minutes to setup and integrate. With a line or two of code and an ENVKEY environment variable, all your config can be accessed just like local environment variables in your code.<p>With node, for example, it’s just:<p>$ npm install envkey —save<p>require ‘envkey’  &#x2F;&#x2F; in main.js<p>Stripe.api_key = process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY &#x2F;&#x2F; this will always be in sync<p>Other languages (Ruby, Python, Go) work similarly, and there’s also a bash library called envkey-source that lets you set shell environment variables with a single line:<p>eval $(envkey-source)<p>This allows you to use EnvKey with any language. It also pairs well with Docker.<p>If you already use 12-factor or a similar approach, it’s extremely easy to switch. There’s an importer for bringing in your existing config that accepts bash KEY=VAL, json, or yaml format.<p>EnvKey is designed to be both simple <i>and</i> easy, and to make a previously messy and error-prone part of your system into something you hardly ever have to think about because it just works.<p>There are a lot of interesting possibilities for the future. Why are we dealing with API keys in the first place? I think this can all be abstracted over. Imagine that when a developer leaves a company, you click once to remove them, and then all the API keys and credentials they ever had access to are all automatically rotated behind the scenes. Or imagine integrating APIs like Stripe with your whole stack in one click. That’s the kind of thing that EnvKey enables and is why I believe this approach can have a huge impact. I hope you’ll give it a try and tell me what you think! I&#x27;m super interested to hear about your ideas and experiences in this area, since HN is obviously one of the places where people are most affected by these issues.","time":1520874097,"title":"Launch HN: EnvKey (YC W18) – Smart Configuration and Secrets Management","type":"story"},{"by":"banksyornot","descendants":12,"id":16569468,"kids":[16570714,16570757,16571807,16573552,16570693,16579627,16571692,16576534,16570767,16572046,16570859,16577937],"score":12,"text":"I am young (early 20s) and my company was just acquired.

How have you taught and&#x2F;or how have you learned?<p>I currently think letting the child take Udacity courses, using online resources, and working on problems from Project Euler are a start. While the child is learning on his&#x2F;her own, there will be one-on-one sessions to elucidate concepts, to introduce new ones, to review old ones, and check work. I think that it is important to show connections from the topic of study to examples in the real world. I am beginning to think that a very useful approach is almost an apprentice model: the tutor and student agree upon a large project to create together with ideas coming from the student and support and guidance coming from the tutor. Once the project is selected, the tutor breaks the project down into actionable items that are learning opportunities (e.g. here would be a good place to practice OOP or a design principle, here would be a good place to examine computational efficiency&#x2F;complexity, here would be a good place to examine recursion). The smaller pieces will add up and get &quot;harder&quot; until the tutor is autonomous. The tutor does the heavy lifting things that are fundamental and currently beyond the abilities of the student.<p>* I am not well versed and will be doing my own research into the &quot;how to&quot; of this question.

We&#x27;re the founders of SafetyWing in the current YC batch. We&#x27;re working on a global safety net for online freelancers, starting with health insurance, which you can get here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.safetywing.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.safetywing.com</a><p>When we quit our jobs to become digital nomads, we discovered that if you are not a full-time employee, you&#x27;re pretty much on your own. You lose stable income and most benefits when you earn money as a freelancer or entrepreneur, and lose the rest of your safety nets by being abroad. We decided to do something about this, and the result is SafetyWing.<p>We&#x27;re three Norwegians: Sondre is also founder of freelancer platform Konsus.com (YC W16). Sarah is CTO, former lead engineer of ad-network Tapdaq &amp; she’s also a musician. Hans a is lawyer and former head of legal at Auka, which is like white-label Venmo.<p>Our first product is $37 per month (4 weeks) for worldwide travel and medical insurance ($30 add-on for US, since US healthcare is much more expensive). It only works when you’re outside your home country, although there is 30 days home country coverage every 3 months so you can visit home (15 for U.S. residents). Covers hospital, doctor, prescription, etc.<p>The hardest thing about making the product has been licensing and getting trust from an insurer. To do that we hired two senior insurance experts who have been in the industry for 30 years. They helped us design it, and get the deal with insurance giant Tokio Marine.<p>Why is it so cheap? 1. Three major exclusions: preventive care, long-term cancer treatment and pre-existing conditions. \n Acute onset of pre-existing conditions is covered though; 2. The price is for ages 18-39. Other ages can buy though at higher prices—sorry, it’s the way this industry works; 3. Lower commissions compared to insurance sold via agents.<p>This is the first step in a plan to build a global safety net for online freelancers and entrepreneurs.<p>Look forward to getting feedback and hearing ideas from HN.

Then, it uses the gathered data to save the statuses of the pages (response codes, title, description, load time...) and it saves the pages in a data structure where it’s possible to create a tree map of the pages (like a folder structure in a file browser). This data structure needs to have weekly snapshots for making comparisons throughout time.<p>I’m thinking about the two main aspects of this bot - first one being the crawling strategy and the second one the data structure to store this data so it can be queried efficiently. Regarding the crawling algorithm, probably the easiest would be:<p>- Visit the page (level 1)<p>- Extract all the internal links<p>- Visit the first link, save data<p>- Go to step 2 (uncover the next level of links)<p>Obviously, there are some critical problems with this strategy. When do we know when we are done? How to prevent cyclical issues? What are the possible problems when crawls are performed concurrently?<p>The second point in question is the database for storing these links. Data should have the following properties:<p>- Associated to a specific website crawl at some point in time (to be compared with other crawls in different time)<p>- Links in each crawl need to be pointed to each other, so a website tree can be constructed.<p>This perhaps calls for a graph database, but that’s expensive (learning it + maintaining cost). What about a traditional RDBMS (Postgres)?

We’re Alvin and George, the founders of Airship (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airshiphq.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airshiphq.com</a>). We built Airship to help companies roll out new features carefully, instead of blindly deploying.<p>You may have seen that a million users are revolting over Snapchat&#x27;s redesign, dropping their App Store rating below 2 stars. You might also remember when Digg launched a redesign in 2010 that caused a 30+% dip in usage in a matter of days. To avoid unpleasant surprises, companies like Facebook and Airbnb have developed their own sophisticated tools to carefully roll out their new features, test and measure their impact incrementally, and roll them back when signs of trouble appear. This way they can be informed about how users receive the features, and can fix mistakes without jeopardizing their entire user base. Then they can publicly release the new feature with reasonable confidence about its likely reception and effects.<p>Alvin and I discovered the importance of controlling feature launches and monitoring them carefully when we worked at Zenefits together. Many companies would like to be able to mitigate risk through controlled feature rollout and rigorous testing, but don&#x27;t have the resources to do it. This approach is proven to work, but remains expensive, since only companies that can afford in-house tooling, and often a dedicated team to maintain it, can do it. It struck us that there was a need here for a product, so we started Airship to build it and make feature rollout accessible to everyone.<p>To use Airship, you install one of our SDKs. Then you can flag or gate code with if&#x2F;else blocks calling a single function provided by our SDK. This automatically gets wired up to controls in the Airship dashboard which allows you to control targeting rules, rollout percentages, and whitelists&#x2F;blacklists.<p>Key features of Airship:\n- Gradually roll out and A&#x2F;B testing of entire features, not just copy and superficial changes\n- No performance hit (checking whether a customer has a feature takes &lt; 0.1 ms)\n- 0% downtime (no dependency on Airship’s services, so effective downtime is 0%)\n- Complex experiments using attributes of Users, Groups (e.g. location, purchase amounts, device types, etc.) as well as other object types (Product Listings, Pages&#x2F;Posts, etc.)<p>We&#x27;d love to hear your feedback and hear about your experiences, ideas, and needs in this area!","time":1520445662,"title":"Launch HN: Airship (YC W18) – Controlled rollouts of new features","type":"story"},{"by":"kkm","descendants":12,"id":16538199,"kids":[16538487,16539278,16538477,16538226,16543907,16539258],"score":36,"time":1520444970,"title":"Airline websites don’t care about privacy follow-up: Emirates in full-on denial","type":"story","url":"https://medium.freecodecamp.org/privacy-leaks-round-trip-emirates-com-in-denial-7f99950bcdd"},{"by":"nikolay","descendants":43,"id":16538090,"kids":[16539577,16540069,16539654,16541343,16540266,16540625,16542639,16542473,16541114,16575386],"score":199,"time":1520444292,"title":"Google Skaffold – Easy and Repeatable Kubernetes Development","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/skaffold"},{"by":"gregorymichael","descendants":63,"id":16538089,"kids":[16538263,16541958,16542154,16541050,16540874,16541494,16541083,16541296,16541076,16541703,16543727,16542940,16542208,16540728,16541736,16543338,16542709,16541575,16543151,16541774],"score":216,"time":1520444291,"title":"How I Helped Potty-Train My Kid Using Twilio and an AWS IoT Button","type":"story","url":"https://twilio.com/blog/2018/03/iot-poop-button-python-twilio-aws.html"},{"by":"PeterMikhailov","descendants":3,"id":16538046,"kids":[16538357,16540502],"score":6,"time":1520444074,"title":"Slack will shut down all IRC gateways","type":"story","url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DXs-hTyU0AEisZY.jpg"},{"by":"carbolite103","descendants":181,"id":16537946,"kids":[16538881,16539272,16540260,16541156,16538824,16540943,16539083,16539854,16541950,16540329,16538463,16538370,16538458],"score":354,"time":1520443453,"title":"The New Wave of Indian Type","type":"story","url":"https://design.google/library/new-wave-indian-type-design/"},{"by":"nickpsecurity","descendants":2,"id":16537926,"kids":[16538381,16537944],"score":1,"time":1520443316,"title":"Defending Scientism: Mathematics Is a Part of Science","type":"story","url":"https://coelsblog.wordpress.com/2014/05/22/defending-scientism-mathematics-is-a-part-of-science/"},{"by":"badwolff","descendants":8,"id":16537911,"kids":[16539796,16538922,16557439,16538553,16542006,16540624,16545139],"score":16,"text":"I am working with some peers who have a website that links to and catalogs a number of resources (think blog posts).<p>It would be ideal for the administrators to be able to archive or have a copy of that web page on their server in case of the original post being deleted, links moving, servers being down etc.<p>Currently they are using http:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is to implement a half solution to this intent.

startups in the last 10 years and made significant contributions to high profile open source projects so I have a reasonably good working history.<p>2 days ago I had this interview with a female recruiter&#x2F;psychologist and the first thing she asked me was &quot;What&#x27;s your nationality?&quot; with a sarcastic smile.<p>I responded, and while I was expressing myself I got some funny looks from her that I thought was humiliating&#x2F;condescending.<p>I even saw she was talking with the employees and I know she was talking about me because I saw her stare me and they were laughing.<p>I thought it was maybe because I&#x27;m from a different country or because I don&#x27;t have a very good accent (I struggle with my speaking sometimes), but I hate when I&#x27;m being

Finbarr and Nick, co-founders of Shogun - a storefront builder for eCommerce sites. We started the company 3 years ago. Initially it was a page builder for Rails apps[1, 2]. After about 9 months, we couldn&#x27;t convince many companies to pay us for that, but one of our prospects wanted to use it for a Shopify store. So we wrote a Shopify integration, waited a week, and gave up.<p>Within a month of giving up, we had some paying customers, so Nick and I continued to work on it as a side project. I went to work as a software engineer, and Nick moved to Thailand. We continued to work on it in our free time, and figured maybe someday it could be a lifestyle business.<p>But it continued to grow. And grow. And grow. By spring of 2017, it was making enough to pay Nick and me a modest salary, so I left my job and Nick came back from Asia. By fall, our growth wasn&#x27;t slowing down, and we figured that this could be a full-on software company.<p>We applied to YC, and Shogun grew 30% during the month between our application submission and our interview. We got in to the Winter 2018 batch.<p>Today Shogun is one of the most popular apps on Shopify. We just launched on BigCommerce as well and are now building out support for other eCommerce platforms.<p>In regard to tech, the hardest part has been implementing workarounds for all the bizarre quirks of each platform. We also build our pages to co-exist with the existing CSS and theme elements, so we have to be really careful with styling conflicts.<p>There are a lot of page building tools out there. Our major differentiator is that we focus on eCommerce specifically and integrate into your existing eCommerce platform&#x2F;backend. Shogun is also developer friendly with strong controls over details like padding and margins. We also built in a &quot;custom elements&quot; feature that allows developers to code re-usable drag and drop templates. Finding the right balance where developers love it and non-developers can learn it is very difficult.<p>We&#x27;re looking forward to hearing feedback and ideas from the community.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9257363\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9257363</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9571603\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9571603</a>","time":1520358735,"title":"Launch HN: Shogun (YC W18) – Storefront Builder for ECommerce Sites","type":"story"},{"by":"Someone","descendants":104,"id":16530506,"kids":[16530976,16531651,16531469,16532389,16535277,16531494,16533919,16533377,16533348,16533331,16532665,16534614,16533728,16532799,16531079,16532692,16534761,16531127,16531074,16532787,16531170],"score":318,"time":1520358661,"title":"132 year old message in a bottle found on West Australian beach","type":"story","url":"http://museum.wa.gov.au/about/latest-news/132-year-old-message-bottle-found-on-wa-beach"},{"by":"pmoriarty","descendants":1,"id":16530409,"kids":[16530840,16530665],"score":4,"time":1520358077,"title":"What if billionaires could live forever?","type":"story","url":"http://www.dw.com/en/what-if-billionaires-could-live-forever/a-42840013?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf"},{"by":"elsherbini","descendants":2,"id":16530416,"kids":[16530701,16531013],"score":3,"text":"I don&#x27;t mind if building the database takes on the order of days, but I&#x27;d like queries to be as quick as possible.

All for free.<p>Aziz and I graduated MIT during the Syrian refugee crisis. Our friends and family all told us about the dire situation, but one problem stuck out: refugees desperately struggled to communicate with the medics, lawyers, and aid workers trying to help them. We built Tarjimly as a way to remotely translate by connecting over Facebook Messenger.<p>A year later, our community of 3000+ volunteer translators has helped over 1500 refugees and aid workers globally.<p>- Translators come back because it finally gives them a way to do more than just donate money or post online.<p>- Refugees come back because machine translation (e.g. Google Translate) for refugee languages severely lacks accuracy and situational awareness.<p>- Aid Workers come back because paid translators are expensive and don&#x27;t even come close to meeting demand.<p>We validated these problems by interviewing over 300 refugees and aid workers and doing a 2-week field study in Greece: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@tarjimly&#x2F;greece-trip-research-reflections-900889b3e6f5\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@tarjimly&#x2F;greece-trip-research-reflection...</a><p>We built a model to predict translator response based on their previous interactions and ping those who are most likely to respond at the time of request. It takes an average of 90 seconds to get connected to a translator from our passive pool and our current match rate is 92%.<p>We see Tarjimly growing into an organization that provides micro-volunteerism at macro-scale.

Users, authenticaiton, authorization, CRUD actions, your usual things. One of my goals is to learn a new language.<p>I&#x27;ve used statically typed languages for the backend for the majority of my dev career (C#, C++, just a little F#). I tried out Python and while I really like it for small projects, parsing data files, and practicing data structures and algorithms I really miss being able to lean on static typing when refactoring. I also miss the strong IDE integration I get with that category of languages.<p>I checked out mypy with Python and it&#x27;s really cool but unless I configured it wrong it doesn&#x27;t apply its type checking across files well.<p>All of this led to me to look at Java and then Kotlin. I love how you only need to type one side of your declarations like I&#x27;m using C#&#x27;s var. The idea of data classes is fantastic as well.<p>Because Kotlin is on the JVM and can interop with Java I&#x27;m hoping I can leverage those libraries and frameworks when needed.
