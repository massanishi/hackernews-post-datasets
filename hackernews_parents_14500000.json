We help users understand what’s wrong and how to get better quickly and cost-effectively.<p>While lowering costs frequently means taking away benefits, we do the opposite — we bring transparency and information to a messy healthcare system that allows employees to better navigate their benefits, resulting in less wasted spend and a faster return to health.<p>This is personal for us. When Nate Maslak&#x27;s mom needed to find a doctor for joint pain, she went to one physician, then another, then another. Six months and thousands of dollars later, she still wasn’t better and gave up on looking. Nate and I found it ludicrous that despite all the information available to us, healthcare remained opaque and intimidating.<p>Without HealthWiz, we have to scour the web for (often biased) information for what’s wrong and take our best guess at how to find treatment, only to be shocked by the bill. Our goal is to help you triage your symptoms with AI and access the most convenient ways to get better while knowing the cost in advance.<p>We’d love to get your feedback on the product (i.e. would

Gox days before it went under. Forgot about BTC for a while, and then bought bitcoin on coinbase about 4 months ago. I had registered my account a few years ago, and had been already been fully verified. \nWhen suddenly crypto started dominating the news, coinbase started having many issues. I chocked it all up to fast growing pains. Suddenly they wouldn&#x27;t let me deposit it a little bit more money because it couldn&#x27;t verify me. They seemed happy to take my money a few months ago and give me full verification but now they wouldn&#x27;t let me do it. Their verification page is also completely broken. (Auto forwards after an error and error messages are not helpful) To get around this, I wired the money in. Once the money came in, I was still unable to buy BTC because I&#x27; was not verified.<p>Throughout this process I&#x27;ve been emailing them and I haven&#x27;t gotten one email back. How is this possible? If you look at the coinbase subreddit [1] you can tell I&#x27;m not alone. Coinbase has about ~8k of my money. I even tried deleting my verification and re verifying, but now my USD wallet just disappeared. I&#x27;m starting to get feeling of deja vu from the Mt. Gox days.<p>They also seem to have over 100M in total funding [2]. One would assume they would prioritize resolving customer issues but it seems like they just don&#x27;t care. If you email them you get an automatic response saying that they&#x27;re busy. Aren&#x27;t there laws they are supposed to follow regarding customer support when they handle money? i.e. respond to questions, or at the minimum respond to requests to release my money.

We refer to ourselves as a dating app largely for SEO but the reality is our users don’t tend to date, they marry!<p>Marriage is central to many Muslims’ upbringings and ethnic, family, and religious pressures make it a difficult search. The casual Western apps don’t cater for this market and the existing Islam-specific offerings are outdated, ineffective websites.<p>As a practising Muslim, Shaz experienced this problem firsthand. He quit a 10 year career in banking to write and release an MVP back in April ’15. With promising traction, he found me (Ryan) on LinkedIn in the then New Year. It was clear it could be a massive opportunity but I believed it needed to broaden its appeal (then it was as an ultra serious marriage service) and modernise its branding&#x2F;marketing to position it for the new generation: this seemed like a great challenge!<p>We’ve tried to build a product that feels fun and light but respects our demographic’s culture and sensibilities, being halal is essential. Some unique features:<p>- Chaperones: In keeping with Islamic tradition, users can opt to have a “Wali” present in their conversations\n- Full privacy: Users can blur their photos and use a nickname to remain anonymous to friends and family\n- Fully verified: All manually approved, Selfie, GPS, and SMS verified users\n- Relevant: Profile information that matters to many in their search, like

I&#x27;ve been freelancing for over three years now, and since I&#x27;ve taken up iOS development - it&#x27;s been difficult to find work in that domain.<p>So, I ended up combing through Angel List, and found a startup that was hiring for iOS. It was based outside of my country, in a first world nation, and ended up interviewing with them. What they mentioned was an 8-week unpaid internship, which I wasn&#x27;t okay with. This was similar to spec work from clients, and I&#x27;m aware of how toxic it is both to the industry and to myself.<p>But without much options, since the startup claimed that there is a full-time opportunity at the end of the internship, I decided I&#x27;ll take it up, although reducing the term to 6-weeks instead. I&#x27;m in a place where leaving the country is my priority, so this seemed like a possible solution at the time.<p>Problem: 3 weeks in, and I feel no drive to continue working for no money, I could instead work on my pet projects. I brought this up to the founders, and they said that bringing that up was already a flag because I was enquiring about finances. I know I&#x27;m being played for work here. But There are 3 more weeks left before which they could potentially make an offer, which I presume is largely going to be based on equity from what I&#x27;ve gathered so far. Now, I&#x27;m not interested in that at the moment. I need the money to pay my bills, and I&#x27;ve burned 3 weeks already.<p>I have signed a contract with the company for 6 weeks, but have no drive to continue work with them.<p>I&#x27;ve learned a lesson here. But should I wait it out for 6 weeks before I get out, or what kind of consequences will there be if I choose to get out before that?<p>Any advice is appreciated.<p>P.S: If you&#x27;re a company looking to hire interns, and not pay them&#x2F;pay them in equity -- Please don&#x27;t.","time":1502181971,"title":"Ask HN: What do I do with my unpaid

Vikram, one of the founders of Dropleaf (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dropleaf.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dropleaf.io</a>), a subscription service for all-you-can-play indie PC games.<p>Zi (Rygeko) and I started Dropleaf because, as gamers, we feel that space around games could be so much better. With the rise of tools that make games easier to make, more people from diverse walks of life are creating games. That means the potential for more games that speak to a wider set of people, and we think that’s really good for the industry. We want to encourage that trend in a few ways:<p>Discoverability: It’s hard for smaller developers to find people who love their games, and it’s also harder for gamers to find games that will resonate. Our focus on indies and our discovery tools mean that we’ll be able to connect devs with the players who will connect with their art.<p>Diversity: We think the industry wins when gamers, devs, and media are more diverse and inclusive. One of our goals is to encourage that with our community and the way we think about what we do (You can read more about our community here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2uyCsFK\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2uyCsFK</a> ).<p>Dollars: Pricing trends in the industry don’t favor smaller developers or gamers. Gamers are less likely to take a risk on buying a game they don’t know much about, so it’s harder for indie developers to gain traction. And when indie devs can’t make money, they can’t make games. So our customers play a flat monthly fee, and devs get paid based on time played. This means games people like to play will be rewarded, and players won’t have to worry about the cost of entry.<p>We’re really excited to launch Dropleaf! We’d love to hear any questions you have, or learn about your favorite games!","time":1502125223,"title":"Launch HN: Dropleaf (YC S17) – subscription service for indie PC games","type":"story"},{"by":"mr_golyadkin","descendants":2,"id":14948973,"kids":[14950679,14950351],"score":12,"time":1502124761,"title":"Birds and Frogs (2009) [pdf]","type":"story","url":"http://www.ams.org/notices/200902/rtx090200212p.pdf"},{"by":"taroth","descendants":4,"id":14948924,"kids":[14949013,14951023,14949900,14949946],"score":24,"time":1502124460,"title":"Show HN: Get a push notification on model training completion","type":"story","url":"https://hyperdash.io"},{"by":"rutenspitz","descendants":25,"id":14949000,"kids":[14951019,14951292,14951733,14951459,14956010,14950732],"score":97,"time":1502124918,"title":"Choose Your Paradox – the downside of the Axiom of Choice","type":"story","url":"https://billwadge.wordpress.com/2017/06/12/thanks-axiom-of-choice-the-banachtarski-paradox/"},{"by":"nirma","descendants":2,"id":14948885,"kids":[14952336,14955619],"score":10,"time":1502124244,"title":"Show HN: iOS Device info done right","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/Nirma/UIDeviceComplete"},{"by":"jp_sc","descendants":406,"id":14948857,"kids":[14949564,14949551,14950561,14949519,14951393,14949548,14952279,14951480,14949439,14954184,14949489,14949431,14949678,14949405,14951470,14949553,14952147,14952046,14949593,14954609,14951604,14952173,14952622,14949460,14952457,14952401,14949357,14951442,14952228,14949953,14949324,14949879,14949541,14950316,14949467],"score":200,"time":1502124062,"title":"On managing outrage in Silicon Valley","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/06/on-managing-outrage-in-silicon-valley/"},{"by":"jessiemcr","descendants":1,"id":14948574,"kids":[14948859,14948947],"score":3,"time":1502122015,"title":"Google's Diversity Chief Responds to Controversial Leaked Anti-Diversity Memo","type":"story","url":"https://www.inc.com/emily-canal/google-responds-to-internal-memo-controversy.html?cid=hmside1"},{"by":"Mikho","descendants":1,"id":14948432,"kids":[14948833,14948634],"score":6,"time":1502121173,"title":"The 10-page diversity manifesto and need to look deeper","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@MichaelBabich/the-10-page-diversity-manifesto-and-need-to-look-deeper-84f62bcbf266"},{"by":"mudil","descendants":224,"id":14948392,"kids":[14948753,14948629,14948816,14948717,14948569,14949121,14948744,14949037,14948712,14948926,14949280,14948681,14949004,14951973,14949234,14948802,14948653,14949902,14949184,14949125,14949542,14948984,14949480,14956226,14949442,14948688,14948706,14948617,14948730],"score":291,"time":1502120941,"title":"SF residents get a shock: Someone bought their street","type":"story","url":"http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/matier-ross/article/Rich-SF-residents-get-a-shock-Someone-bought-11738236.php"},{"by":"chrisgannon","descendants":6,"id":14948273,"kids":[14948856,14948644,14949336,14948967],"score":36,"time":1502120229,"title":"Show HN: 10 Best Web Animations","type":"story","url":"http://www.creativebloq.com/inspiration/10-best-web-animations-by-chris-gannon"},{"by":"Itzcoatl","descendants":3,"id":14948188,"kids":[14948230,14948249,14953451],"score":1,"text":"Hi there,<p>Would you recommend AWS over MS Azure to setup a virtual machine for academic purposes?

Unlike current speech recognition APIs, developers can customize our API to more accurately recognize an unlimited amount of industry specific words or phrases unique to what they&#x27;re building without any training required. For example, you can recognize thousands of product or person names with our API.

We&#x27;re building a calendar for teams.<p>Calendars have traditionally been built for individuals, not teams. As teams grow, calendars become so busy that optimal scheduling and time management is nearly impossible without software. Meetingbird analyzes participants&#x27; availability, meeting rooms, and other constraints to quickly find the best meeting time and location. When team members&#x27; calendars are completely booked, Meetingbird understands which meetings can more easily be rescheduled than others, and inputs that to the scheduler. The scheduler improves as it better understands everyone’s calendar preferences. Our goal is a calendar that makes scheduling easy, allowing everyone to spend less time scheduling and more time getting things done.<p>For individuals, Meetingbird serves as a beautiful (we hope!) calendar that makes scheduling as easy as sending a link or picking a time from within Gmail with our Chrome extension (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;meetingbird&#x2F;joheckceackgilmpkgcihjfgggbnejcg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;meetingbird&#x2F;joheck...</a>).<p>We first became interested in this problem because we experienced first-hand the pain of scheduling working at companies in a variety of industries, from tech to finance. The process of building Meetingbird and talking with hundreds of employees at mid-to-large-sized companies has confirmed how time-consuming and frustrating scheduling is for everyone.<p>We’d love to hear your feedback and your ideas about calendars and any frustrations of using them as teams!","time":1501779605,"title":"Launch HN: Meetingbird (YC S17) – A Calendar for Teams","type":"story"},{"by":"Shinkirou","descendants":254,"id":14921018,"kids":[14923546,14922473,14921280,14922600,14921586,14922387,14921331,14921232,14921201,14921650,14923156,14922612,14922927,14921430,14921465,14921711,14922769,14921813,14921464,14923138,14921458,14921079,14921293,14922668,14921669,14923457,14922295,14921345,14922069],"score":567,"time":1501777759,"title":"Researcher Who Stopped WannaCry Ransomware Detained in US After Def Con","type":"story","url":"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ywp8k5/researcher-who-stopped-wannacry-ransomware-detained-in-us-after-def-con"},{"by":"Froyoh","descendants":1,"id":14921005,"kids":[14927003,14921117],"score":2,"time":1501777704,"title":"Ask HN: How do you use note-taking apps?","type":"story"},{"by":"urahara","descendants":24,"id":14920934,"kids":[14921860,14923211],"score":81,"time":1501777238,"title":"The ctenophore’s brain and the evolution of intelligence","type":"story","url":"https://aeon.co/essays/what-the-ctenophore-says-about-the-evolution-of-intelligence"},{"by":"hunglee2","dead":true,"id":14920920,"kids":[14921049,14921014],"score":5,"time":1501777182,"title":"Full Transcripts of Trump’s Calls with Mexico and Australia","type":"story","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/politics/australia-mexico-transcripts/?utm_term=.32866acc5ebb"},{"by":"rev","descendants":4,"id":14920878,"kids":[14924414,14926754,14921068],"score":12,"time":1501776991,"title":"Systemd port for OpenBSD","type":"story","url":"https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-ports&m=150152452217481"},{"by":"darwhy","descendants":45,"id":14920856,"kids":[14924299,14921511,14925583,14924479,14922849,14926557,14924840],"score":136,"time":1501776845,"title":"Transitioning entirely to neural machine translation","type":"story","url":"https://code.facebook.com/posts/289921871474277/transitioning-entirely-to-neural-machine-translation/?utm_source=codedot_rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS+Feed"},{"by":"cowabungamann","descendants":3,"id":14920781,"kids":[14920997,14920983],"score":16,"time":1501776460,"title":"Show HN: Monsterz puzzle game","type":"story","url":"https://varunrau.github.io/monsterz/"},{"by":"gschrader","descendants":2,"id":14920777,"kids":[14930135,14920806],"score":4,"time":1501776434,"title":"After phishing attacks, Chrome extensions push adware to millions","type":"story","url":"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/08/after-phishing-attacks-chrome-extensions-push-adware-to-millions/"},{"by":"fireworks10","descendants":25,"id":14920696,"kids":[14921208,14921224,14921351,14922148,14921248,14923023,14921111,14921731],"score":50,"time":1501775968,"title":"Offpeak.io helps you avoid peak season to book the cheapest vacation","type":"story","url":"https://thenextweb.com/shareables/2017/08/03/avoid-peak-airplane-cheap-flights/"},{"by":"danieka","descendants":63,"id":14920616,"kids":[14921254,14921534,14921195,14921527,14921304,14920931,14920659,14923762,14920930,14921121,14921033,14920897,14920667,14921286,14921658,14921363,14920974,14921395,14921230,14920962,14921171,14920953,14921089,14921119,14921216,14922088,14921077,14921914,14939276,14921174,14920973,14925463,14922217,14921512,14927473,14921229],"score":50,"text":"The situation is as follows:<p>I live in Stockholm but my current lease will run out at the end of August.

Richard<p>-------------------------------------<p>Hi HN,<p>My name is Richard Bronson and I&#x27;m the founder&#x2F;CEO of 70MillionJobs (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.70millionjobs.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.70millionjobs.com</a>). Our website is the Internet&#x27;s first job board for 70 million Americans—1 in 3 adults—with criminal records.<p>I&#x27;m something of a domain expert in this area because I myself have a criminal record. In the early 1990s, I worked on Wall Street and some of what I did was illegal. For a time I was a partner at the infamous Wolf of Wall Street firm, Stratton Oakmont (Scorcese film). I ended up with a 2 year Federal prison sentence. I was guilty.<p>I experienced first hand how difficult it was to get on with life after going through the &quot;system.&quot; I served as Director at Defy Ventures, a great non-profit in the reentry space, but was interested in a scalable solution to ex-offender unemployment and resultant recidivism. I felt a new, for-profit, tech-based approach was necessary, so I launched 70MillionJobs. We&#x27;re seeking &quot;double bottom-line&quot; returns: make money and do social good.<p>Like most job boards, our business model is based upon employers paying to advertise their jobs. We expect additional revenue to come from municipalities, who spend tens of billions of dollars annually, when someone is rearrested.<p>You might not be surprised to learn that most formerly incarcerated men and women are petrified to discuss their background with prospective employers. So we created a &quot;safe haven&quot; where all parties knew the score, and applicants could relax knowing that jobs being offered were with companies that accepted their pasts.<p>Since many of our applicants don&#x27;t have a laptop or easy access to the Internet, we send out text alerts they can easily respond to. Because most of these folks have limited work experience and limited formal education, we plan on building a video resume platform to accompany their resumes.

Until now I&#x27;ve been a language teacher and translator but for some time I&#x27;ve been trying to switch to programming. So far I&#x27;ve grasped some firm (I think) skills in HTML5 and CSS3 and basic in Bootstrap and Sass.  Everything I know is self-taught. I&#x27;ve cut some layouts (just to practice) and I&#x27;m currently voluntarily working on a design actually to be put on the web.\nI totally realize that in order to be treated seriously on the market I need to learn JS, at least jQuery, but I feel I&#x27;d need somebody to help me with it in order to develop. To be blunt - where I am is the furthest I could go on my own.\nI&#x27;m a 34-years old woman and I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll be treated like some sort of a dinosaur in the programmers environment. E.g., last year I had an interview for a front-end developer internship led by people who were all about 10 years younger than me - a pretty devastating experience. And questions like: &quot;How would you feel working in a male-only team?&quot;... Basically everyone seems surprised that a person (and a woman) my age with no actual experience is trying to find a place to start from. I&#x27;ve got the impression that currently I&#x27;d have to be really good at programming to get a chance (obviously not the case) or just drop it and think of doing something else.\nSo here are my questions: \nWhat do you think are the next steps I should take? \nWould you consider employing a person like me? \nHow to find somebody who could help me with developing my skills? \nWhat else could I do to increase the chances of being hired?","time":1501680099,"title":"Ask HN: Woman (34) trying to become a front-end developer – is this

was the first employee at a tech startup in SV. I developed and lead many critical projects in the company, and my current title is principal architect (I&#x27;m 32 years old). The company grew a lot (100 people) and it&#x27;s in a healthy growing state. The upper management wants to keep growing sales until it makes sense to sell the ship, and this will still take probably 4-5 years (sales right now are ~12M$&#x2F;y and I think the plan is to iterate towards 50-100M$&#x2F;y). In terms of financing, we are at series C.<p>My current compensation numbers are:<p>- Base salary: 230k$<p>- Stock: fully vested and exercised my 4 year stock option grant, and after dilutions I have about 0.7% of the company in common stocks<p>The problem is: I&#x27;m bored out of my mind and I want to explore something different. So, I interviewed for a couple Google-like companies and they offered me this:<p>- Title: Software Engineer<p>- Base salary: 190k$<p>- Performance bonus: 15% a year<p>- Signon bonus: 50k$<p>- RSU package: 150k$&#x2F;y (600k$ grant over 4 years)<p>I then told my boss in all honesty that I wanted to leave, and do so in good terms, and after a few days he came back to me saying the company can put on the table another 4 year grant for the same number of stock options I received initially, so that would mean another 0.7% over the next 4 years.<p>However, the company valuation is now pretty high, so I wouldn&#x27;t be able to buy those options when they vest and I&#x27;d have to stay here until the very final end (potentially 4+ years).<p>I am a very financially oriented person, so, does it make sense to diversify at Google at this point, or throwing away this additional 0.7% is irresponsible considering the situation? If the company reaches those target sales an exit might as well be in the 300-600M$ range, so you can do the math for that 0.7%...<p>However, I am afraid that with those &quot;golden handcuffs&quot;

We help you make your friends laugh by turning your text messages into personalized, funny GIFs. We&#x27;re currently serving 4M GIFs daily.<p>It works like this: Whenever you want to spice up your conversation, you click on the Guggy button and get a selection of GIFs with your text in them. If you find one that you like and that you think is funny, you click it and a link gets copied to your clipboard.<p>When we started Guggy, we were trying to provide non-technical users with an easy way of creating funny GIFs, and for that we built a GIF editor, only to discover that the real problem was that people had a hard time combining the right text with the right GIF. That got us thinking that we should try to automatically create the text&#x2F;image pairing, relieving users from the need to search and match. To do that, we&#x27;ve built an NLP engine that understands &#x27;messaging language&#x27;, that is, slang, excited writing (e.g. “soo amazinggg!”) and leetspeak, to name a few.<p>We’ve also built a fast image rendering engine that generates the final media for the user in real time. This stands out from existing solutions, which rely on existing media files (served via CDNs). We don’t store the files at all, we generate them on the fly at each request. That gives us flexibility in personalizing the content to the user.<p>We’re two co-founders who are also cousins. We have been working together on numerous projects for several years, and always wanted to build something related to humor. Of all the projects we&#x27;ve tried, this is the one that just sort of took off, and we&#x27;ve been following where the users want to take us. It&#x27;s kind of a dream project because the technical challenges are interesting and we get to work in a space that amuses us.<p>Here is a real example from our users of how a regular message can become expressive and engaging using Guggy - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;img.guggy.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;iL1rqhoZE7&#x2F;animated&#x2F;2&#x2F;h&#x2F;guggy.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;img.guggy.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;iL1rqhoZE7&#x2F;animated&#x2F;2&#x2F;h&#x2F;guggy.gi...</a><p>We offer our own Android&#x2F;iOS GIF keyboards for natural experience, or you can just use our standalone apps.

all, I have a special snowflake career question: should I quit my management consulting job and try to become a developer?<p>About me: 31 years old, work for a tier 2 strategy consulting firm doing mostly pure strategy work. I&#x27;m an engagement manager. While I like the intellectual challenge of coming up with growth strategies, I&#x27;ve ended up doing mostly private equity due diligences and exit options that look interesting appear limited.<p>Meanwhile, I&#x27;ve been an amateur coder since 2006 - started with R &#x2F; SAS &#x2F; STATA (Econ research) picked up emacs in undergrad (graduated in 2008), got pretty good at elisp and org mode [0], picked up clojure about 6 years ago, spent all of my MBA (top 3) coding web apps instead of networking (mistake!). I was watching a rich hickey lecture (hammock driven development) and was just thinking that if this is something I really like doing, should I try and put together a portfolio and get a job as an entry-level developer at a shop that uses clojure? I&#x27;m in NYC if that matters.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure I could go from where I am now to an entry-level understanding of clojure + clojurescript + Java in 6-12 months. That being said, my one developer friend told me that working for a large company as a developer can also really suck and be a real dead end.<p>What do you think?<p>[0] Which has absolutely given me a huge leg up at my current job, btw","time":1501547878,"title":"Ask HN: Should I become a developer?","type":"story"},{"by":"panarky","descendants":16,"id":14896970,"kids":[14897665,14897070,14898510],"score":15,"time":1501546690,"title":"Why Americans Get Conned Again and Again","type":"story","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/07/americans-con-fraud-balleisen/535281/?single_page=true"},{"by":"andanthor","descendants":3,"id":14896968,"kids":[14900755,14897037,14903131],"score":8,"time":1501546632,"title":"ScalaQuest – the online game to learn Scala","type":"story","url":"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/andanthor/scalaquest-a-game-to-learn-scala?ref=bwzkt3"},{"by":"sohkamyung","descendants":58,"id":14897090,"kids":[14897765,14898288,14897404,14897507,14897956,14900077,14900464,14897565,14897707,14897411],"score":166,"time":1501548500,"title":"Race to discover Planet Nine using astronomy and new computational techniques","type":"story","url":"http://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/satellites/is-there-a-giant-planet-lurking-beyond-pluto"},{"by":"janober","descendants":12,"id":14896917,"kids":[14899543,14899031],"score":69,"time":1501545905,"title":"Several departures at Kleiner Perkins","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/31/several-departures-at-venture-firm-kleiner-perkins"},{"by":"xbmcuser","descendants":4,"id":14896880,"kids":[14897120,14896897,14897155],"score":15,"time":1501545490,"title":"Teamsters convince Congress to block driverless trucks","type":"story","url":"https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2017/07/31/teamsters-convince-congress-to-block-driverless-trucks/?amp=1"},{"by":"nreece","descendants":9,"id":14896844,"kids":[14902198,14900991,14900158,14901258,14898877],"score":29,"time":1501545118,"title":"How “Shareholder Value” Is Killing Innovation","type":"story","url":"https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/shareholder-value-is-killing-innovation"},{"by":"tysone","descendants":197,"id":14896774,"kids":[14897118,14897024,14897448,14897215,14897017,14899248,14897692,14897180,14897309,14897504,14897330,14897810,14897438,14897261,14896924,14896906,14896986,14897260,14897500,14898042,14897083,14898617,14903733,14901441,14897249,14897689,14897818,14898816,14897595,14897002],"score":210,"time":1501544154,"title":"Apple’s Silence in China Sets a Dangerous Precedent","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/31/technology/apple-vpn-china-dangerous-precedent.html"},{"by":"ccvannorman","descendants":1,"id":14896577,"kids":[14896616,14896799],"score":1,"text":"HN,<p>I&#x27;ve read, including on HN, that &quot;big bang&quot; refactors are never a good idea.

What does mastery entail?<p>More generally - a question for those billing this sort of money - what do you specialize in, how much experience do you have, how could one get there in their mid 20s?","time":1501423490,"title":"Ask HN: What does it take to bill £500 a day?","type":"story"},{"by":"haydenlee","descendants":214,"id":14885863,"kids":[14886481,14886095,14886229,14886244,14886239,14886103,14886007,14886990,14887748,14886632,14888267,14889120,14887602,14886868,14886290,14886358,14886801,14886610,14886533,14887529,14887567,14886930,14887063,14886200,14887933,14890595,14887078,14887781,14890637,14917514,14886922,14886284,14888761,14886091,14887493,14889149,14886044,14886147,14886129,14886265,14886267],"score":352,"time":1501421613,"title":"Ask HN: Have you regretted making something open-source?","type":"story"},{"by":"kbp","descendants":12,"id":14885779,"kids":[14888941,14886673,14887187,14887302,14887095,14888411,14890800,14887065,14886920],"score":171,"time":1501419960,"title":"An Algebraic Language for the Manipulation of Symbolic Expressions (1958) [pdf]","type":"story","url":"http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/MIT/AIM-001.pdf"},{"by":"brezelben","descendants":10,"id":14885742,"kids":[14887539,14887232,14888555,14888476],"score":47,"time":1501419340,"title":"Show HN: Lambdacult, a low-cost alternative to API Gateway for Lambda functions","type":"story","url":"https://lambdacult.com/"},{"by":"Jenkam","descendants":23,"id":14885745,"kids":[14886226,14890177,14885982,14885974,14885932],"score":16,"time":1501419391,"title":"Show HN: Time.Graphics – flexible timeline","type":"story","url":"https://time.graphics"},{"by":"ingve","descendants":247,"id":14885733,"kids":[14886365,14886471,14887204,14887168,14886873,14886752,14886634,14891274,14894338,14887423,14890212,14886598,14887340,14890844,14886890,14886582,14890088,14889371,14886466,14898835,14889595,14889534,14894223,14886423,14891865,14891770,14890010,14889374,14887826,14891528,14887518,14891381,14889115,14890739,14889691,14886960,14887267,14887024],"score":482,"time":1501419147,"title":"Why I left Medium and moved back to my own domain","type":"story","url":"https://arslan.io/2017/07/30/why-i-left-medium-and-moved-back-to-my-own-domain/"},{"by":"GordonS","descendants":19,"id":14885552,"kids":[14886055,14886714,14885793,14885778,14885788,14886285,14886565],"score":58,"time":1501415752,"title":"The Adventures of AV and the Leaky Sandbox [pdf]","type":"story","url":"https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/thursday/us-17-Kotler-The-Adventures-Of-Av-And-The-Leaky-Sandbox.pdf"},{"by":"Flott","descendants":4,"id":14885598,"kids":[14885853,14887019],"score":26,"time":1501416509,"title":"WestJet reports disclosure of guest information","type":"story","url":"http://westjet2.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&item=1256"},{"by":"levimaes","descendants":4,"id":14885518,"kids":[14885625,14885846],"score":3,"text":"Does anyone have any &quot;life saving&quot; bash profile aliases, bashrc configurations or settings or restrictions otherwise, which you regularly institute to &quot;hazard control&quot; yours and others&#x27; human error?

This is Nikhil here with Ankush and Kunal. We founded Piggy (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;piggy.co.in&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;piggy.co.in&#x2F;</a>), an investment app for Indians. Think of it as a mobile-first Vanguard for India. With Piggy you can invest in mutual funds, track your investment portfolio and save for retirement.<p>Historically, public sector employees vastly outnumbered private sector ones in India. Those public jobs came with pensions, so no one had to think about investing their own money. In 2016, for the first time, the private jobs overtook the public. People have to invest their own money now, and it&#x27;s complicated and expensive. We built Piggy to help solve those problems.<p>This new Indian middle class is searching for good places to invest, which is why the mutual fund market is growing so quickly - assets grew by 40% in just the last year to $300B. Every one of these new investors has a smartphone, which is why Piggy is mobile first.<p>The app has quick online account setup, easy to use interface, built in user support (in app chat, email and call). Users can access all the fund houses in a single app. Transactions cost less than $10 a year and there are options for lowering that cost. The app charges a flat fee of 50 cents per buy transaction. We take no hidden commissions from asset management firms, unlike most services in India. Saved commissions mean higher returns for our users.<p>Ankush and I have fixed income analytics experience at an investment bank, and Kunal has worked with Amazon. When we started working, we got limited advice from our family on where to invest, mostly in traditional bank-based saving products with low returns. We also saw many of our friends fall prey to bad financial products. When we did learn about mutual funds, there was nothing out there that was easy to sign up and use, that didn’t charge a bomb or hidden commissions. We got together over many late night conversations and decided to build it ourselves.<p>We’d love to answer your questions about Piggy and love to discuss fintech in India and emerging markets!","time":1501088434,"title":"Launch HN: Piggy (YC S17) – Investment App for

If you&#x27;ve been thinking about or working on a side project or have some idea that won&#x27;t let you go, you&#x27;re who we want to reach.<p>Why try to help? Nat and I are passionate about AI. We want to\nsee more Show HNs that use machine learning. We&#x27;ve been rewarded by\npursuing our own shower-thoughts and want to remove any barriers from\nothers thinking of doing the same.<p>Our plan for this is AI Grant (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aigrant.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aigrant.org&#x2F;</a>), a non-profit\ndistributed AI research lab. We&#x27;re issuing grants to the smartest\npeople we can find, doing interesting work that might otherwise not\nhappen, and connecting them to mentors, experts, and each other. We ran our first round this spring, and awarded $50k in grants to 10 projects.<p>Filling out the form should take less than five minutes. Grantees get:<p><pre><code>  - $2,500 in cash.\n  - $20k each in Google Compute Engine credits.\n  - Q&amp;A with AI experts including Andrej Karpathy (Director of AI at Tesla and previously at OpenAI) and researchers at Google.\n  - Access to the network of other grantees\n  - 250 Tesla K80 GPU hours from FloydHub.\n  - $1k in ScaleAPI data labeling credits.\n  - $5k in CrowdFlower data labeling credits.\n</code></pre>\nThis is not an investment in a company, it&#x27;s a grant to follow your\ndreams in research. You don&#x27;t need to be part of any special\norganization or community to apply. We don&#x27;t ask for equity.

Access a line of cryptocurrency credit from the command line in under 5 minutes\n2. Easily build a bot that auto-invests in loans under hyper-customizable, programmable criteria<p>Check it out: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dharmaprotocol&#x2F;dharma-cli\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dharmaprotocol&#x2F;dharma-cli</a><p>Why I Think This Is Cool:<p>1. Loans in the Dharma Protocol are basically miniature ICOs issued by borrowers -- an investor&#x27;s stake in a loan is held in a digital token that entitles them to future cash flows.  That means loans are just as tradeable and moddable as Bitcoin or Ether, and packaging loan tokens into tranched debt instruments of all shapes and sizes is relatively trivial to implement in an Ethereum smart contract.<p>2. Dharma is an open protocol.  This opens the door for any client application, including existing online lending platforms, to tap into a non-proprietary army of lending bots as a source of lending capital.  This has the potential to dramatically lower the cost of capital for online lenders -- and, in turn, borrowers.<p>How This Can Be Better:<p>1. Loans in the Dharma Protocol are slow and expensive.  Ether gas costs are fairly steep for writing the requisite loan data onto the Ethereum blockchain, and an on-chain auctioning mechanism places a bottleneck on how fast a loan can be funded.  We plan to address these issues by migrating towards an off-chain auctioning mechanism layered on top of a Kademlia-style P2P network.<p>2. The identity verification mechanisms we use to assess baseline creditworthiness are very weak -- any mainnet release of the protocol would necessitate much more robust KYC flows.<p>Please play around with the CLI -- would love to hear feedback!","time":1501005917,"title":"Show HN: Dharma – Programmable Peer-To-Peer Loans Using Ethereum Smart Contracts","type":"story"},{"by":"FahadUddin92","descendants":2,"id":14849752,"kids":[14850344,14849898],"score":1,"text":"Is it possible to find if you are behind a VPN?","time":1501003311,"title":"How does a site find you are behind a VPN?","type":"story"},{"by":"itamarb","descendants":25,"id":14849707,"kids":[14852230,14850375,14851214,14850511,14852243,14850706,14852114,14852414,14850438,14850509],"score":65,"time":1501003104,"title":"Voice Synthesis for in-the-Wild Speakers via a Phonological Loop","type":"story","url":"https://ytaigman.github.io/loop/"},{"by":"SellaBlondheim","descendants":21,"id":14849555,"kids":[14850480,14850088,14850742,14851169,14849964,14850176,14849987,14850779,14850125,14850998,14851211,14850057],"score":46,"text":"Hi all,<p>We are D-ID (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;d-id.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;d-id.com&#x2F;</a>), part of the YC S17 batch. We protect people&#x27;s identities by processing face images in a way that denies automated face recognition, while keeping them similar to the human eye. We’ve just launched on TechCrunch and signed our first pilot, so here’s some info about us.<p>With the advancements of face recognition technologies (both in accuracy and growing use), the data in face images must be protected, because unlike passwords, you cannot change your face.<p>We came upon this idea after experiencing it as a personal pain at first, while serving in the military where we were not allowed to post to social media for reasons of information security, later to realize that it has become a worldwide issue where we’re all losing our basic right to privacy.<p>At first it was meant to be a B2C product, but we then understood that businesses are in greater need due to their responsibility in handling personal data of their clients and&#x2F;or employees.<p>Since we use image manipulation techniques, it&#x27;s clear that if all goes well it will probably start an arms race with face recognition algorithms. Would love to hear your ideas as to how to win in this battle :)<p>Our approach helps companies which handle images (cloud storage or even just profile pictures of their employees&#x2F;users) to comply with privacy regulations, such as the GDPR (an EU regulation, nearly worldwide in its scope, which addresses face images as Sensitive Personal Data).<p>This gives companies a way to keep using images but without the responsibility of protecting the sensitive data they carry, helping them build their brand reputation for caring about the privacy of their clients&#x2F;employees. We also enable security agencies and governments to protect their citizens and employees.<p>We’d love to hear feedback from the HN community!

10 years in Silicon Valley and several very early stage startups, I&#x27;ve burned out.

The company is poorly run and I don&#x27;t have the drive to do anything about it. Every time I talk to a new company about positions I lose interest at the thought of going through the process or onboarding at a new company.<p>I&#x27;ve considered and pursued other positions outside of engineering such as PM, eng manager and similar positions. But because I&#x27;ve spent my entire career at early stage startups my experience on paper is limited to engineering systems so even progressing in my career is not an option as companies want experienced managers and people with proven experience for other positions. Essentially 10 years of experience is worthless even though I have been doing those things. Just not as a my official job.<p>My past experiences at startups has almost entirely soured me on every company I come across. I&#x27;m now negative and skeptical about everything. No company sounds interesting. I think every founder I talk to is full of shit. Every product is crap and a waste of time.<p>Maybe even the worst thing is that I don&#x27;t even have motivation to do my own project. Every time I sit in front of a computer to write code I stop almost immediately stop.

everyone! I am Bjoern from Templarbit (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.templarbit.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.templarbit.com</a>). Me and my co-founder Matthias are part of the current YC batch and are excited to launch our product. Templarbit protects web applications from XSS attacks and other malicious activity.<p>Previously Matthias and I worked together at a cyber security firm where we saw many vulnerability reports. After spending some time running engineering at another startup we realized there is a big need for a security solution that can easily be understood and deployed. Something that helps software teams protect what they are building.\nWe reached out to friends and strangers at other software startups to see how they handle the security of their applications. Surprisingly to us, not many teams felt like they did a good job in that area, mostly due to lack of tools available to them.<p>With the advent of browser support for Content Security Policies, there are new ways to protect against these attacks. Setting a CSP header is a great way to mitigate XSS attacks, but managing changes to the policy and having a reporting endpoint that gives you insights into what is being violated is still difficult. Templarbit helps with this. Our reporting dashboard can help you discover and fix violations in real-time and shows you in most cases exactly where in your app the issue exists.","time":1500914871,"title":"Launch HN: Templarbit

recognition technologies (both in accuracy and their growing use), the data in face images must be protected, because unlike passwords- you can’t change your face.<p>Our product processes face images in a way that denies automated face recognition, while keeping them similar to the human eye.\nThis helps companies which handle images (cloud storage or even just profile pictures of their employees&#x2F;users) to comply with privacy regulations, such as the GDPR, in a revolutionary method in terms of data protection, technology and risk management.\nIn addition, it helps them promote their brand reputation for caring for the privacy of their clients&#x2F;employees.\nWe also enable security agencies and governments to protect their citizens and employees.<p>We&#x27;re excited to offer companies a way to keep using images but without the responsibility of protecting the sensitive data they carry.<p>We’d love to hear feedback from the HN community!<p>Will be glad of course to

We&#x27;re a fully-managed freelancer marketplace for SaaS companies. We give SaaS companies an experts.[domain].com that their users can go to for do-it-for-me help from specialist freelancers, whom we call &quot;experts&quot;. We source, vet, and manage the experts. We’ve also built software to connect a user and an expert together via screenshare for on-demand sessions.<p>It&#x27;s a common problem at SaaS companies that their users want more hands-on help than in-house support can provide, but it takes a userbase of around 1M people and an organic freelancer community to form around the software (think Google Certified Experts or Quickbooks Pro Advisors) before that can easily be provided.<p>We built Sixty to solve the problems we experienced during our time as Squarespace Specialists (Squarespace’s version of experts). With several years under our belt, we noticed 4 major problems around the concept of an ‘experts directory’:<p>1) Most SaaS users need a little bit of external help to derive the full value from more complex software – despite the software increasingly intended to be DIY. Users usually only need to get over a few small roadblocks to succeed.<p>2) The company’s goal of making software intuitive enough for anyone conflicts with the expert’s goal of making more money. Experts all have project minimums that presuppose them taking over the whole project.<p>3) Companies would need user bases of 100k+ before they would be able to even consider creating an experts community.<p>4) Building a community platform is fundamentally different than what SaaS companies were founded to do. It bloats the business model.<p>Our goal is to be a better solution in each of these 4 areas: 1) So users could get smaller scope work accomplished – helping them be more independent and successful on the platform. 2) So the experts can be a part of a better community with increased pay and more stability 3) SaaS companies with smaller user bases can take advantage of the improved activation and retention that expert communities bring, and 4) So SaaS companies can focus on what they do best – building great software.<p>We’d love to hear your thoughts about what we’re building with Sixty! And if you’re building a SaaS company or are particularly skilled at any startup or SMB software (Segment, Mixpanel, Zapier, Customer.io, Mailchimp, Weebly, etc.), we&#x27;d love to learn from you.","time":1500488301,"title":"Launch HN: Sixty (YC S17) – Freelancer Marketplaces for SaaS Companies","type":"story"},{"by":"artsandsci","descendants":28,"id":14806541,"kids":[14808477,14807008,14812111,14807101,14808834,14807426,14806978,14807169,14808306],"score":38,"time":1500488232,"title":"DeepFlight – High Performance Personal Submarines","type":"story","url":"https://www.deepflight.com/"},{"by":"briantmaurer","descendants":38,"id":14806636,"kids":[14807300,14807186,14807354,14807326,14812631,14808907,14824034,14813240,14806917,14807164,14806942,14808951,14806935,14812546,14811272,14807123,14806928,14808507,14813671,14807665,14807936],"score":68,"text":"I have some bitcoin in Coinbase and I&#x27;m not a bitcoin expert, should I move my coins before the upcoming forks?","time":1500488906,"title":"Ask HN: I have Bitcoin in Coinbase, what should I do before the forks?","type":"story"},{"by":"swsieber","descendants":12,"id":14806488,"kids":[14807153,14806805,14808666,14807172,14807420],"score":152,"time":1500487838,"title":"Visualizing Algorithms (2014)","type":"story","url":"https://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/"},{"by":"aboodman","descendants":162,"id":14806440,"kids":[14806941,14806823,14806782,14806889,14809782,14806765,14811315,14807421,14813326,14807626,14807210,14810513,14806681,14809356,14811367,14806733,14810655,14806598,14810956,14806695,14806796],"score":196,"time":1500487582,"title":"Filecoin: A Decentralized Storage Network [pdf]","type":"story","url":"https://filecoin.io/filecoin.pdf"},{"by":"craigcannon","descendants":279,"id":14806393,"kids":[14807742,14809105,14807188,14807082,14807290,14808804,14807979,14812803,14806848,14808115,14810372,14810260,14808384,14806964,14807011,14808524,14807581,14807990,14808430,14810885,14807218,14808379,14811016,14807498,14811879,14809485,14807019,14807479,14807917,14807059,14807233,14810451,14811235,14808347,14818416,14807812,14817507,14808703,14810496,14807212,14810720,14808928,14807630,14811105,14809870,14809862,14810800,14807919,14807764,14807632,14807574,14807213,14808118,14807918],"score":569,"time":1500487161,"title":"Why Should I Start a Startup?","type":"story","url":"https://blog.ycombinator.com/why-should-i-start-a-startup/"},{"by":"realitygrill","descendants":29,"id":14806379,"kids":[14808778,14806613,14806875,14807709,14806811,14809554,14808690],"score":25,"text":"My friends and I run a hacker house in the Bay Area.

On this claim, the contributor tells what he&#x2F;she did that month, linking to PRs or screenshots that corroborate such claim.<p>Then, a maintainer assigns a number of &quot;tickets&quot; to the claim. The number of tickets depends on 1) the relative effort of the contribution(s) and 2) the impact that contribution had to the project.<p>(The relative effort would be calculated as &quot;if one of our team members were to do it, how many hours would it take?&quot;).<p>After the month has ended, we run a small &quot;lottery&quot;. Random tickets are selected, and each selected ticket is worth, say, $50 that the contributor can later cash-out using Bitcoin (or wire transfer with fees deducted).<p>This idea is well-intended, but my biggest fear is that it could make my community toxic. Contributors could possibly get overly competitive, or maybe upset because a claim did not reward as many tickets as one expected.<p>I do not know any open source project that does something like this. Things like Bountysource do not apply because they are centered around specific issues. Within our project, a contributor may help in different ways that do not necessarily translate to issues.<p>I have several questions regarding this &quot;experiment&quot;, but maybe the most important ones are:<p>1 - Do you know any project that implements such reward system? Or maybe failed attempts?<p>2 - Do you believe adding money to open source contributions could demotivate contributors or create a toxic community?<p>I feel that&#x27;s an interesting subject and I&#x27;d love to have HN&#x27;s take on it.

We also love audiobooks (when they’re read by really gifted narrators), so we knew that stories written for print often work well in audio. So we built Audm.<p>We release most stories in the app at the same moment they hit the magazines’ websites. Right now we produce 5-8 articles (3-5 hours of audio) per week, and that number is growing fast as we onboard more publications. Our subscribers seem to have an insatiable appetite.<p>Something that we didn’t fully appreciate when we started (although our users did) is just how skilled a narrator has to be if they’re going to sound good reading articles that are dense with information and nuanced ideas (which often means very complex sentence structure).

I have also started out surveying computer vision .<p>If you have side projects or you are independent programmers and won&#x27;t mind having someone working with you , please contact me.<p>I am not limited to the above mentioned languages. I have studied computer algorithms and language complexity from a decent university.","time":1500292469,"title":"Ask HN: Would like to work for free","type":"story"},{"by":"bdbm","descendants":91,"id":14787927,"kids":[14788427,14788579,14788814,14788233,14788571,14788443,14791080,14788764,14788486],"score":139,"time":1500295364,"title":"“Spiel des Jahres” Game of the Year 2017 winners","type":"story","url":"http://spieldesjahres.com/en/game_archive/2017"},{"by":"mooreds","descendants":78,"id":14787685,"kids":[14789292,14790353,14790039,14790101,14789570,14789346,14790156,14790146,14790728,14791806,14789714,14790382,14790396,14792367,14791123,14792360,14790250,14791807],"score":105,"time":1500292986,"title":"Content isn't king","type":"story","url":"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2017/7/13/content-isnt-king"},{"by":"velmu","descendants":11,"id":14787590,"kids":[14788722,14788609,14788687,14789202],"score":65,"time":1500291944,"title":"PostgreSQL 10 Beta 2 Released","type":"story","url":"https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1763/"},{"by":"alexellisuk","descendants":25,"id":14787394,"kids":[14791384,14792311,14791320,14787740,14793687],"score":171,"time":1500290020,"title":"Get eyes in the sky with your Raspberry Pi","type":"story","url":"https://blog.alexellis.io/track-flights-with-rpi/"},{"by":"npm_start","descendants":3,"id":14787395,"kids":[14790204,14787611],"score":18,"time":1500290034,"title":"Animating svg with flubber in react","type":"story","url":"https://sghall.github.io/resonance/#/documentation/animate"},{"by":"wolframhempel","descendants":59,"id":14787285,"kids":[14788060,14787554,14787583,14787562,14787755,14787883,14787659,14793428,14788844,14788161,14787545,14790797,14787511,14796351,14791942,14788977],"score":391,"time":1500288946,"title":"A real world guide to WebRTC","type":"story","url":"https://deepstreamhub.com/tutorials/protocols/webrtc-intro/"},{"by":"rbanffy","descendants":121,"id":14787708,"kids":[14787982,14788473,14789332,14788104,14788729,14788118,14788739,14788173,14788004,14788502,14788006,14789384,14788570,14788619,14788373,14788153,14788316,14787967],"score":90,"time":1500293202,"title":"IBM z14 mainframe","type":"story","url":"https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/z14"},{"by":"scaryclam","descendants":156,"id":14787161,"kids":[14787402,14787221,14787270,14787355,14787398,14787304,14787266,14787267,14787232,14787359,14787260,14787503,14787347,14787372,14787460,14787381,14787287,14787676,14787911,14787401,14787310,14787349,14787385,14787435,14787548,14787286,14787652,14787376,14787465,14787297,14787570,14788132,14787412,14787283,14787383,14794432,14787328,14787351,14787484],"score":99,"time":1500287633,"title":"UK plans age verification for porn websites from 2018","type":"story","url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40628909"},{"by":"goodpersonon","descendants":4,"id":14786848,"kids":[14786856,14786871],"score":5,"text":"Being a student, one of the best ways to maintain my finance is to fetch alternatives providing special student discounts.","time":1500283582,"title":"Ask HN: What are some of the best products offering student discounts?","type":"story"},{"by":"blaze33","descendants":15,"id":14787063,"kids":[14793388,14792132,14791538,14792583],"score":60,"time":1500286405,"title":"Processing Emotions","type":"story","url":"http://www.willmeekphd.com/processing-emotions/"},{"by":"tmbsundar","descendants":29,"id":14786771,"kids":[14787274,14787418,14786874,14787316,14787137,14787442,14792470,14787119,14787086,14787724,14788214,14845582,14788019,14787324,14787786,14787148,14787996,14787403,14787555,14788049],"score":40,"text":"I&#x27;ve a Visual Basic application at hand which served its time and still going strong in a productions setting.

I started working with neural nets I instinctively started using git. \nSoon I realised that git isn&#x27;t working for me. Working with neural nets seems way more empirical than working with a &#x27;regular&#x27; project where you have a very specific feature (e.g. login feature): you create a branch where you implement this feature. Once the feature is implemented you merge with your develop branch and you can move to another feature.<p>The same approach doesn&#x27;t work with neural nets for me. There&#x27;s &#x27;only&#x27; one feature you want to implement - you want your neural net to generalise better&#x2F;generate better images&#x2F;etc (depends on the type of problem you are solving). This is very abstract though. One often doesn&#x27;t even know what&#x27;s the solution until you empirically try to tweak several hyper parameters and see the loss function and accuracy. This makes the branch model impossible to use I think. \nConsider this: you create a branch where you want to use convolutional layers for example. Then you find out that your neural net is performing worse. What should you do know? You can&#x27;t merge this branch to your develop branch since it&#x27;s a basically &#x27;dead end&#x27; branch. On the other hand when you delete this branch you lose information that you&#x27;ve already tried this model of your net. This also produce huge amount of branches since you have enormous number of combinations for your model (e.g. convolutional layers may yield better accuracy when used with different loss function).<p>I&#x27;ve ended up with a single branch and a text file where I manually log all models I have tried so far and their performance.

Especially that our first language is not English. We don&#x27;t want to use in the name: freelancer, coder, online, marketplace or anything like this. There are a bunch of names like this, and they sound needy.<p>We want something that will be associated with the safe space, where you can come and delegate coding and design and concentrate on your main business. I want people to think that this is their dedicated team that is always there in their back pocket.<p>If you have any ideas, would appreciate your opinion.","time":1499694499,"title":"Ask HN: Crowdsourcing a company name","type":"story"},{"by":"willyyr","descendants":17,"id":14735757,"kids":[14736033,14737098,14736245,14736368,14737669],"score":26,"time":1499693890,"title":"New business apps in Office 365: Connections, Listings and Invoicing","type":"story","url":"https://blogs.office.com/en-us/2017/07/10/new-business-apps-in-office-365-business-premium-help-you-run-and-grow-your-small-business/"},{"by":"Aissen","descendants":35,"id":14735752,"kids":[14737217,14737841,14736454,14738104,14738430,14740978,14739837,14736646,14752382,14736842,14736287,14736206],"score":181,"time":1499693844,"title":"Awk driven IoT","type":"story","url":"https://anisse.astier.eu/awk-driven-iot.html"},{"by":"curiouslurker","descendants":2,"id":14735695,"kids":[14735959,14735776],"score":5,"time":1499693352,"title":"Augmented reality could help you learn to dance better","type":"story","url":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/09/dance-reality-arkit-app/?param=july-10-2017"},{"by":"stanleydrew","descendants":107,"id":14735759,"kids":[14738785,14736136,14736623,14736619,14737615,14738718,14737971,14738669,14738410,14736575,14737291,14736186,14738628,14736969,14738448,14736159,14736963,14737001,14736171],"score":123,"time":1499693905,"title":"Two-factor authentication is a mess","type":"story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/10/15946642/two-factor-authentication-online-security-mess"},{"by":"nissimk","descendants":7,"id":14735450,"kids":[14741082,14741332,14740322,14741034],"score":29,"time":1499691428,"title":"Secret millions for 0x00A651D43B6e209F5Ada45A35F92EFC0De3A5184","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-10/secret-millions-for-0x00a651d43b6e209f5ada45a35f92efc0de3a5184"},{"by":"lainon","descendants":49,"id":14735598,"kids":[14736393,14737347,14735888,14735854,14736237,14736547,14736875,14735964],"score":46,"time":1499692521,"title":"Philosophy of Psychiatry (2015)","type":"story","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/psychiatry/"},{"by":"RX14","descendants":6,"id":14735391,"kids":[14735413,14735758,14735960],"score":6,"time":1499690937,"title":"How to build video games for Windows using Crystal","type":"story","url":"http://blaxpirit.com/blog/23/how-to-build-video-games-for-windows-using-crystal.html"},{"by":"arbuge","descendants":28,"id":14735384,"kids":[14735816,14736024,14735610,14737201,14738142,14736354,14735574,14735573],"score":75,"time":1499690816,"title":"Goldman Sachs: The Great American Bubble Machine (2009)","type":"story","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-great-american-bubble-machine-20100405"},{"by":"ritadias","descendants":76,"id":14735269,"kids":[14738966,14739268,14738288,14737642,14737086,14741468,14739918,14738470,14737367,14737452],"score":224,"time":1499689562,"title":"60 FPS Animations with CSS3","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/outsystems-experts/how-to-achieve-60-fps-animations-with-css3-db7b98610108"},{"by":"bemmu","descendants":6,"id":14735183,"kids":[14738764,14739366,14738732,14737722,14737578],"score":137,"time":1499688574,"title":"Bitcoin mining the hard way: the algorithms, protocols, and bytes (2014)","type":"story","url":"http://www.righto.com/2014/02/bitcoin-mining-hard-way-algorithms.html"},{"by":"tbking","descendants":24,"id":14735190,"kids":[14735586,14735421,14735379,14735841,14735469,14735372,14735983,14737462,14736407,14736300,14735477],"score":34,"time":1499688651,"title":"Solution to Wi-Fi problems on HP laptops with Realtek RTL8723BE NICs (2016)","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/tarunbatra/fixRTL8723BE"},{"by":"zabana","descendants":2,"id":14735114,"kids":[14735315,14735281],"score":3,"text":"I&#x27;d like you to share your experiences with the community.

In the end I just barely managed to pass my bachelor degree in CS (with an extension-semester) and doing now my masters.<p>The experimental things that I did so far: \n-Doing 3 10-day meditation retreats to make me feel less stressed and overwhelmed. \n-Meditating at home(although it&#x27;s often difficult to maintain this habit)\n-2-3 times a year LSD to have a mental reset if I feel stuck(cleaning my turmoil, refocus on the important). Recently also two times mircodosed LSD on days where I&#x27;m stressed or depressed to have more energy.\n-Doing an Ayahuasca retreat last year in Peru was somewhat helpful to learn stuff about me, but did not help me be more productive<p>I feel like all these things are just a patch on my ADHD problem. I feel thrilled and motivated for a few days or weeks and then my usual self creeps back with only slight improvements that remain. \nI&#x27;m not really motivated and only get things done when I feel the guilt and pressure built up. I had several ideas to build my own little project but I never managed to make anything all these years on my own (motivation is gone after a few hours of work). I feel if I continue like this I will struggle through all my life: Always distract myself to hide from negative emotions(because I&#x27;m overwhelmed), always having trouble to have focus, always just do the minimum and as a result be miserable with myself because I won&#x27;t satisfy my high ambitions and dreams.<p>An approach would be medication but prefer not to take this route or just as a last resort.<p>What were your approaches and experiences that helped you?

However things have changed, and I lost faith in our leadership and product, and I lack power to do anything about it. So I already parted ways and am working on my next startup.<p>But those shares remain, and even heavily discounted as common stock my shares are still a life changing amount of money. However I&#x27;m personally certain that I have a snowball&#x27;s chance in hell of actually seeing a liquidity event that pays me out. Nevertheless the investment market has spoken, and investors with the same or better access to information than I have now have decided to make further investments at an even higher valuation.<p>So.. can I cash out on this? My shares are illiquid, subject to all the usual restrictions. But I would have no trouble convincing the company to allow me to donate a large percentage to a charity of my choice, or even a self-directed charitable fund. I should then be able to claim a tax deduction equal to the paper value of the shares today. While my bank account will still remain empty, it would allow me to pay approximately zero federal taxes from now until I stop working, giving me effectively a 35% salary boost. And this wouldn&#x27;t be tax fraud -- the new investments coming in demonstrate that sophisticated investors who know what they are doing and should be trusted more than me, do in fact think the company is worth this amount or more.<p>Did I miss something? Some googling hasn&#x27;t shown any examples of this. I&#x27;ve read examples of successful entrepreneurs transferring shares into charitable organizations, but not any early-stage companies as far as I can see.

Preferably 8gb RAM and MacOS or Linux.&quot;<p>Note: This story can be verified with a well-known VC and other reputable folks around Silicon Valley, just ping me for details.","time":1499358978,"title":"Young Minority MIT Grad Needs a Laptop to Code, can We Help Him?","type":"story"},{"by":"jesses","descendants":3,"id":14711510,"kids":[14714137,14711513],"score":12,"time":1499358109,"title":"Show HN: Gigalixir: A PaaS for Elixir Apps","type":"story","url":"https://www.gigalixir.com/"},{"by":"janober","descendants":425,"id":14711461,"kids":[14711661,14712840,14711815,14711960,14712977,14711961,14711741,14712591,14711737,14711964,14711716,14711655,14711734,14712926,14711481,14712945,14712313,14712506,14711636,14711863,14712397,14711663,14711936,14712294,14711755,14713216,14714649,14712592,14713071,14712341,14713746,14712724,14712718,14712343,14713857,14713148,14711850,14713841,14713394,14716185,14713748,14713019,14713125,14712366,14713925,14713202,14712224,14712326,14715304,14713014,14713491,14714130,14712793,14712102,14714954,14711847,14711797,14713062,14713269,14713023,14712900,14713380,14712203],"score":462,"time":1499357700,"title":"SoundCloud cuts jobs, closes SF and London offices","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/06/soundcloud-the-youtube-for-audio-cuts-173-jobs-closes-san-francisco-london-offices"},{"by":"sakunthala","descendants":16,"id":14711492,"kids":[14713866,14713420,14711925,14712023,14724888,14712131,14713308,14712416,14712846],"score":102,"time":1499358010,"title":"How to Create a MOOC in 28 Days","type":"story","url":"https://www.indiehackers.com/@sknthla/how-to-create-a-mooc-in-28-days"},{"by":"adgasf","descendants":50,"id":14711368,"kids":[14711970,14712011,14712058,14712934,14712125,14711902,14711896,14711876,14714912,14712001,14711933],"score":21,"time":1499357012,"title":"Why I hate Java","type":"story","url":"http://warp.povusers.org/grrr/java.html"},{"by":"aeto","descendants":4,"id":14711494,"kids":[14711497,14713102,14712560],"score":7,"time":1499358014,"title":"Show HN: Harvest, the easiest way to grow your mind (spaced repetition learning)","type":"story","url":"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/harvest-grow-your-mind/dejecgndbecimagkaefkfdaedaimamji"},{"by":"drecoe","descendants":12,"id":14711397,"kids":[14713712,14718106,14713396,14713128],"score":27,"time":1499357244,"title":"Red Digital Cinema Announces Holographic Media Machine","type":"story","url":"http://www.red.com/hydrogen"},{"by":"cmg","dead":true,"id":14711155,"kids":[14711235,14711966,14711250],"score":83,"time":1499355195,"title":"Let's Encrypt: Wildcard Certificates Coming January 2018","type":"story","url":"https://letsencrypt.org/2017/07/06/wildcard-certificates-coming-jan-2018.html"},{"by":"darwhy","descendants":191,"id":14711153,"kids":[14714001,14711217,14711222,14713614,14711211,14711206,14711471,14711199,14712251,14714207,14711273,14712212,14711543,14715594,14714084,14711377,14711282,14711398,14713849,14713403,14714079,14711352,14714517,14713438,14711253,14711450,14713218,14712117,14712033],"score":857,"time":1499355185,"title":"Wildcard Certificates Coming January 2018","type":"story","url":"https://letsencrypt.org//2017/07/06/wildcard-certificates-coming-jan-2018.html"},{"by":"littlestymaar","descendants":2,"id":14711084,"kids":[14726937,14712794],"score":17,"time":1499354616,"title":"Oracle Releases an OCI-Based Container Runtime Written in Rust","type":"story","url":"https://thenewstack.io/oracle-opens-oci-container-runtime"},{"by":"bcx","descendants":330,"id":14711621,"kids":[14711826,14712539,14712261,14712424,14715427,14712014,14711795,14711891,14711996,14712169,14718536,14718897,14715601,14713840,14724903,14714463,14717864,14715728,14719248,14726040,14713874,14714006,14711955,14714632,14718019,14713178,14714983,14714736,14725109,14712743,14716472,14752925,14714669,14719810,14717074,14718935,14722809,14712317,14711926,14712120,14715241,14712087,14712075,14711825,14712872,14713478,14712171,14711809,14712170,14712279,14712995],"score":659,"time":1499358760,"title":"Mental health is still an issue in the workplace","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@OlarkLiveChat/its-2017-and-mental-health-is-still-an-issue-in-the-workplace-61efbef092f"},{"by":"sillysaurus3","descendants":6,"id":14711607,"kids":[14713419,14713905],"score":17,"time":1499358672,"title":"Scientists think they've solved the mystery of Devil's Kettle Falls","type":"story","url":"http://www.startribune.com/scientists-think-they-ve-solved-the-mystery-of-devil-s-kettle-falls/414996694/"},{"by":"jlos","descendants":3,"id":14711074,"kids":[14711111,14711327],"score":3,"text":"I&#x27;m researching ways of monetizing open source projects -

am 23 yo, live in Brazil, I&#x27;m the tech co-founder of a $5M valuation startup, and I do not know if I leave my CS Degree, girlfriend, and country to continue developing my business. Probably anyone in the world knowing just that would say to me to go on into this.<p>However, the story is not so simple. Resuming it, everything started with my partner. He is the CEO of the company and is working on that for 3 years now. I started to work with him as a freelancer, but at the same time, when he was applying for accelerators in SV I was the CTO. After a while, we were accepted by one of those and I went to California, owning 10% of the company.<p>There I developed the product during 6 months, finally releasing that 4 months ago. The release was great, despite that, coding was basically everything that I was doing at the time, and was pretty concerned about my education and missing my family and friends. So I decided to come back. Since then, the app is exactly the same, with the same bugs, but is the biggest app in the sector, with that my partner was able to raise $400k in a $5M valuation. And now he is asking me to go back resume my work.<p>If I go I will not finish my University possibly losing a Doctorate opportunity that I&#x27;m working on, my GF will hate me and I will be leaving everything I have, to pursue that dream. Everyone that I ask about it does not give any insightful feedback, so I humbly come here to know your opinions.<p>edit: Line breaks.","time":1499209164,"title":"Ask HN: Work in my invested startup or finish University?","type":"story"},{"by":"avenoir","descendants":50,"id":14698886,"kids":[14700401,14699350,14701356,14701489,14701972,14701539,14709008,14699009,14700223,14700648,14700441],"score":202,"time":1499209526,"title":"How Elephants Avoid Cancer (2015)","type":"story","url":"http://www.nature.com/news/how-elephants-avoid-cancer-1.18534"},{"by":"kawera","descendants":332,"id":14698741,"kids":[14699040,14702301,14699855,14699150,14699090,14699011,14699088,14698988,14699034,14699517,14699206,14699762,14700301,14699447,14706837,14698952,14699082,14699227,14699124,14700350,14700174,14699557,14699479,14701926,14699658,14699091,14700254,14700573,14700465,14700312,14699103,14705303,14699932,14699186,14699538,14699455,14700575,14700678,14700329,14699845,14699824,14699089,14700062,14699646,14699140,14709197,14702435,14699695,14699024,14702082,14702840,14699126,14701004,14700565,14699169,14701659,14699151,14699155,14699252],"score":355,"time":1499207432,"title":"The $100B per year back pain industry is mostly a hoax","type":"story","url":"https://qz.com/1010259/the-100-billion-per-year-back-pain-industry-is-mostly-a-hoax/"},{"by":"alanfranz","descendants":232,"id":14698545,"kids":[14700613,14698966,14699500,14698964,14699917,14700403,14699263,14698876,14699371,14699267,14701045,14699014,14701598,14701221,14701517,14699739,14699184,14699798,14699426,14717908,14699035,14698783,14699603,14701477,14698947,14699424,14699030,14700184,14700006,14699214,14701241,14699425,14699598,14699084,14701944,14722810,14705688,14700229,14706040,14698938],"score":398,"time":1499205136,"title":"Stopping the Internet of Noise – A useful internet back again","type":"story","url":"https://www.franzoni.eu/stopping-the-internet-of-noise/"},{"by":"finanancebuff","descendants":42,"id":14698652,"kids":[14699248,14699523,14708228,14700557,14699241,14700835,14699131,14699924],"score":43,"time":1499206247,"title":"How much is 5% of Saudi Aramco based on DCF Model?","type":"story","url":"https://www.perchingtree.com/saudi-aramco-pre-ipo-valuation-discounted-cashflow-model/2/"},{"by":"tommoor","descendants":6,"id":14698405,"kids":[14702443,14702357,14699492],"score":28,"time":1499203588,"title":"Quitting the Paint Factory (2004)","type":"story","url":"http://www.molvray.com/ebooks/Quitting_the_Paint_Factory_Mark_Slouka.html"},{"by":"tdurden","descendants":10,"id":14698312,"kids":[14698847,14698607,14699608,14699640,14699441],"score":41,"time":1499202620,"title":"Can Microbes Encourage Altruism?","type":"story","url":"https://www.quantamagazine.org/can-microbes-encourage-altruism-20170629/"},{"by":"lifeisstillgood","descendants":19,"id":14698296,"kids":[14699445,14700850,14699147,14699493,14700551,14701856,14709480,14701790,14708540,14700909,14700618],"score":8,"text":"So I have been happy with the monzo bank, it came highly recommended and it has been putting in a lot of effort as a challenger bank.

I don&#x27;t believe I am that good - mostly average. A couple of areas slightly above average with other areas below average to counterbalance. So I tried to recount my academic, personal, and professional history. Turns out that I am very mediocre on paper, so I tried to walk him through some of the techniques I use. This is an abbreviated list of the things said in that coversation:<p>I keep reference books about design patterns and language quirks handy while making sure to never shoehorn them in. If it fits, use it. If it doesn&#x27;t - that&#x27;s fine. Not everything fits squarely into the GoF design patterns.<p>Use static analysis tools to look for potential hotspots, and learn why the tool would flag that snippet as a hotspot in the first place.<p>I don&#x27;t do any serious fiddling with katas and code challenge sites unless it&#x27;s exploratory. Find real-world applications instead.<p>I don&#x27;t commit building algorithms to memory. Learn the properties, complexities and reasons for use of an algorithm. Someone has already written a bug-free version of it. Just Import it.<p>Also, don&#x27;t be afraid to challenge the validity of a library or the code base. They were created by humans capable of screwing up. It&#x27;s tough reading unfamiliar code, but it becomes significantly easier when you already know the code&#x27;s intent.<p>Stop chasing frameworks, and start creating the most stable foundation you can. Most frameworks are templates for building and abstractions for things that have already been done plus configurable customization. Invest time in the techniques that power those frameworks. Learn how to build a single-page app without Angular, and then leverage Angular as a tool to develop instead of a crutch.","time":1499088655,"title":"Ask HN: How did you become a good developer?","type":"story"},{"by":"antr","descendants":2,"id":14687898,"kids":[14688180,14687975],"score":6,"time":1499086752,"title":"Apple has built an office for grown-ups","type":"story","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/6e873378-5d68-11e7-b553-e2df1b0c3220?mhq5j=e1"},{"by":"bd82","descendants":58,"id":14687858,"kids":[14689800,14690612,14689812,14694866,14691425,14690283,14691811,14690791,14698601,14690142,14691707],"score":88,"time":1499086292,"title":"Theia – One IDE for Desktop and Cloud","type":"story","url":"https://typefox.io/theia-one-ide-for-desktop-cloud"},{"by":"peter_crown","descendants":6,"id":14687860,"kids":[14687931,14687968],"score":7,"time":1499086299,"title":"Show HN: 4vid – Download any video.

We effectively haven&#x27;t raised money and consider ourselves 50&#x2F;50 partners.<p>Two weeks ago, I was talking to someone who has been working on a SaaS product in the same space for the past few years (in Europe; we&#x27;re on the other side of the ocean) and was about to release it. I offered for him to fly out and work with us for two weeks before he launched to see if he wanted to join us instead.<p>Working together has gone pretty well, and we&#x27;re asking ourselves: what would be a fair&#x2F;standard distribution of equity in the following scenarios?<p>1) He launches his product, and joins us a co-founder.

All management could tell me is that I made this person &quot;feel uncomfortable&quot;, I am guessing in a sexual way.  My desk was moved across the building away from where my immediate co-workers sit, and I was told  to be not talk to women at the office unless absolutely necessary regarding business matters.<p>The extent of my non-work-related conversation with female employees has been saying hello&#x2F;goodbye and making small talk on occasion (How long have you been with the company? Do you have travel plans for this summer? Are you doing anything fun this weekend?) I realize some of these questions could be viewed as hitting on someone, but that was not my intention, and believe that question was cleared up once they responded to me that they were going to see their boyfriend&#x2F;girlfriend.<p>I am a male in my mid-20s on an internship ending in a few months. (The company has told me they do not have the budget to hire me full-time or extend my internship.) In the grand scheme of things, I understand this is small potatoes.  But what has kept me up at night is the worry that I could be accused of sexual harassment or rape in the future leading to job loss or criminal charges.<p>I am frankly quite scared of talking to or approaching any women in my office, even for a work-related purpose.

HN, could you help me with a problem please?<p>Problem:<p>I&#x27;m quadriplegic and drive a powered wheelchair called the Permobil M400 3G[1] which is great.  However, the streets are very narrow and when a vehicle is behind me I&#x27;ve no way of knowing how far behind me it is.  The narrow streets seem to also act like canyons and mess with the sound of the vehicles, often making it sound like vehicles are behind me but it&#x27;s actually one street over. Transit vans in the UK have wing mirrors at my head height and a few days ago I was clipped on the head by a police van,  It wasn&#x27;t serious demonstrates the problem.<p>Solutions So Far:<p>I had a Raspberry Pi 3 with a camera attached to my head rest and streamed the video to VLC running on my iPhone, however the lag was terrible. Tried configuring it so that the RPi connected to the Internet so my phone connected to it over the net but that was very slow. Instead I made a RPi Wi-Fi hotspot making a connection between my iPhone and the RPi which reduced the lag, but it was still too slow.  By the time I see something with that kind of lag it&#x27;s too late.<p>I&#x27;m also constrained by the fact that I can&#x27;t build things myself and I&#x27;m surrounded by technophobes who would think building something electronic impossibly difficult, and then not even try.  No idea why this is so and still haven&#x27;t found a way round it.<p>So, anybody got any bright ideas about how I might solve this issue?  If I were to write a wish list for this solution it would be:<p>1. As near to real-time video feed as possible\n2. To be able to pick up the video stream on my iPhone as I can control my phone with the chin controller on my wheelchair\n3. The components can be easily bought, put together and attached to my chair.\n4. The solution doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune, but obviously I need a solution so don&#x27;t let that crimp your thinking too much.<p>TIA!<p>Stuart\nrobotsandcake.org<p>[1]:http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.permobil.com&#x2F;en-GB&#x2F;English&#x2F;C&#x2F;Products&#x2F;M400-Corpus-3G&#x2F;","time":1498833454,"title":"Ask HN: Video rearview mirror for a wheelchair?","type":"story"},{"by":"sndean","descendants":16,"id":14670909,"kids":[14671435,14675046,14675691,14675002],"score":65,"time":1498832555,"title":"Dyalog APL 16.0","type":"story","url":"http://www.dyalog.com/dyalog/dyalog-versions/160.htm"},{"by":"molecule","descendants":16,"id":14670794,"kids":[14671420,14671779,14671290,14671618,14671269,14674220],"score":36,"time":1498831638,"title":"Residents of Colorado Springs undertook a radical experiment in government","type":"story","url":"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/06/30/colorado-springs-libertarian-experiment-america-215313"},{"by":"okokoktroway","descendants":40,"id":14670847,"kids":[14671278,14671088,14671249,14671507,14671175,14671143,14671303,14671086,14671115,14673022,14671162,14671307,14671065,14671607,14671274,14671248,14671396,14671077,14671392,14671286,14671646],"score":24,"text":"In order to raise a responsible and a “good” human being, how far should parents control vs give freedom to their children?

I truly believe women already know the answer deep down.  Okay, maybe it’s not that deep down, more like it’s just below the surface.  It hurts like hell, though many women have a difficult time transitioning from getting out of their own way emotionally.<p>Now, you are reading this, stating one of two things, either: 1) Greg, you’re an a-hole, or 2) That’s right Greg, tell it!   Which side of that fence you stand on depends on perhaps which gender you are; and also how much confidence you hold.  Yes, confidence and I’ll get into that shortly.<p>For starters, men need to gain the balls to be honest, no matter what!  Yes, no matter what our ladies reactions may spew, we need to stay strong, dig deep and be honest!  Women, you need to get a grip and accept honesty.  “What the hell are you saying Greg; I can accept honesty!”  I can almost feel the tension build.  Your eyes and mouth begin to snarl as you get ready to attack back verbally.<p>Yes, the biggest reason, or one of the main reason men lie to you is they cannot handle your defensive maneuvers.  That’s right, the way you get defensive, go for the tit for tat, start yelling and screaming at the one thing you crave from men: total honesty.\nI know not all women get overly defensive with their man being honest, thus can take that in stride.  Though often many women will lurch out, start bashing and ripping their man apart, for being honest.  So, guess what ladies?  Men lie to avoid these situations.  Again, I am not condoning these actions by men!

It was getting to a point where it was super frustrating and I kinda started hating it.<p>Eventually, in May last year, I pulled the plug and we parted ways. We had some clients that we wanted to wrap up our work for, so it took us till August that year to clear things. Meanwhile, since I had a family to support, I decided to get another job to cover my bills. This job was done remotely (most of the time) so I could spend time with family and not stress about fighting traffic etc.<p>Now, around November last year, I started playing with an idea on the side. Started to hack a solution for it in evenings, nights and weekends. It kinda took off around Feb this  year where I am making some recurring revenue (nothing major, but good enough for a side project).<p>So now I am thinking that if I were to focus 100% of my energy on this, maybe I can go from side-project to company status. However, for that I would have to quit my &quot;day job&quot;.<p>So my questions:<p>1. How should I quit my current job where they don&#x27;t feel used? \n2.

My organization does not give a penny for employees.<p>I am wondering if anyone has done it here and was it worth it 2&#x2F;5 years down the line.","time":1498321478,"title":"Ask HN: Is EMBA from MIT/Wharton or MBA from UCLA Worth It?","type":"story"},{"by":"JumpCrisscross","descendants":142,"id":14626107,"kids":[14626523,14626455,14626462,14626386,14626410,14626409,14626441,14627076,14626553,14626440,14626653,14626493,14626403,14626529],"score":60,"time":1498321445,"title":"Why Did a U.S. Destroyer Fail to Dodge a Cargo Ship?","type":"story","url":"https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/06/23/world/asia/destroyer-fitzgerald-collision.html"},{"by":"jimnotgym","descendants":2,"id":14626080,"kids":[14626116,14626094],"score":1,"time":1498321165,"title":"Cyber attack on UK parliament","type":"story","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/24/cyber-attack-parliament-email-access"},{"by":"walterbell","descendants":162,"id":14626193,"kids":[14627150,14627455,14626907,14627745,14627216,14627038,14626954,14627438,14627347,14628158,14628821,14629320,14627674,14627146,14626968,14627409,14627421,14629613],"score":207,"time":1498322273,"title":"Windows 10 Without the Cruft: Windows 10 LTSB (Long Term Servicing Branch)","type":"story","url":"https://www.howtogeek.com/273824/windows-10-without-the-cruft-windows-10-ltsb-explained/"},{"by":"JoshTriplett","descendants":19,"id":14626010,"kids":[14627588,14627473,14627581,14628488,14628247,14627740,14628168,14629382,14627441,14629383],"score":203,"time":1498319965,"title":"Sans Bullshit Sans: leveraging the synergy of ligatures (2015)","type":"story","url":"https://pixelambacht.nl/2015/sans-bullshit-sans/"},{"by":"awjr","descendants":121,"id":14625989,"kids":[14626175,14626139,14626161,14626255,14626138,14626156,14626123,14626366,14626091,14626191,14627002,14626188,14626393],"score":32,"time":1498319689,"title":"If You Can’t Ban Cars Downtown, Take Away Parking Spaces","type":"story","url":"https://www.fastcompany.com/40434409/if-you-cant-ban-cars-downtown-just-take-away-the-parking-spaces"},{"by":"jonbaer","descendants":6,"id":14625918,"kids":[14631611,14629962,14628062],"score":22,"time":1498318688,"title":"Exascale on the Far Horizon for Cash-Strapped Oil and Gas","type":"story","url":"https://www.nextplatform.com/2017/06/23/exascale-far-horizon-cash-strapped-oil-gas/"},{"by":"sharkdp","descendants":195,"id":14625795,"kids":[14626957,14626357,14625928,14625806,14628272,14627244,14626751,14626341,14626066,14627753,14626054,14626460,14627425,14626025,14626000,14629254,14635853,14627251,14628076,14627465,14625987,14626118,14627164,14626133,14625998,14626599,14626078,14626235,14635776,14627033,14628652,14628704,14626744,14626917,14626081,14627510,14628730,14626854,14626844,14626336,14628335,14626558,14627090,14626848,14626676,14627167,14626946,14626217,14626011,14626578,14627501,14626721,14627114,14627902,14627256,14627293,14626861,14627098,14626677,14629255,14626265,14626075],"score":354,"time":1498316333,"title":"Show HN: Insect – a high-precision scientific calculator with physical units","type":"story","url":"https://insect.sh/"},{"by":"turrini","descendants":17,"id":14625761,"kids":[14625860,14628224,14629819,14627980,14627996,14627044],"score":35,"time":1498315651,"title":"Average App Store Review Times","type":"story","url":"http://appreviewtimes.com/"},{"by":"ahiknsr","descendants":40,"id":14625736,"kids":[14627088,14626580,14626701,14628778],"score":96,"time":1498315190,"title":"Blockstack: A New Decentralized Internet [pdf]","type":"story","url":"https://blockstack.org/whitepaper.pdf"},{"by":"dynamicsol","descendants":1,"id":14625747,"kids":[14643472,14636574],"score":3,"time":1498315332,"title":"Everything you need to get up and running with Kotlin programming language","type":"story","url":"https://kotlinist.com/index.html"},{"by":"omilu","descendants":72,"id":14625706,"kids":[14626322,14626491,14626567,14626434,14626324,14626602,14627628,14626790,14627317,14627271,14626911,14627424,14628545,14626342,14626384],"score":155,"time":1498314716,"title":"Chai Wallahs of India","type":"story","url":"http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/06/14/481878368/tea-tuesday-meet-the-chai-wallahs-of-india"},{"by":"ryanworl","descendants":6,"id":14626236,"kids":[14628151,14628148,14629702,14626807,14627231],"score":6,"text":"Hi HN,<p>I&#x27;ve recently come up with a method retrieving data out of S3 indirectly using another AWS service for less than the posted egress rates.

Let&#x27;s be honest; culture issues can often a reason for failure but never a reason for success. Uber must be doing a lot of things right.<p>Uber is not going out of business and will not run out of runway. Its fundamental value hasn&#x27;t changed, and it&#x27;s still growing. It&#x27;s a useful tool that people love.<p>I&#x27;ve met many employees from Uber, and they were all engaged, excited, and proud to be at Uber, at least until this firestorm started. Uber must have been doing something right.<p>Uber was in a unique position in history going up against an entrenched opponent with established law backing it.<p>Was Greyball OK?  Ask yourself this, if you were running Uber and faced with its challenges it had, how many &quot;entrepreneurs&quot; here would have gone toe-to-toe with Congress, NYC, Washington DC, etc. and how many of you would have gone quietly into the night as a niche service? I don&#x27;t think I could have done what he did.<p>Was Greyball ethical? That&#x27;s very subjective, but the fact that laws have changed to accommodate Uber says volumes.<p>Having worked with Travis years ago, I believe Travis cares about Uber&#x27;s success more than almost anything else, and that means having a successful team and winning culture.  That love may be the single biggest catalyst for fixing issues inside Uber.  The investor&#x27;s likely focus now is an IPO and cashing out while they can; not great for Uber.<p>Take a look at Apple after Jobs left in 85&#x27; and currently after he passed away.  It&#x27;s not the same Apple; it&#x27;s still a hugely successful company, they&#x27;ve lost something irreplaceable.  Jobs had many flaws, arguably much worse than Travis.<p>Travis is Uber&#x27;s Steve Jobs; Travis lives and breaths Uber just like Jobs.  Uber is still going to be a success, but it&#x27;s not going to be the same without Travis.<p>Post limited by 2000 characters.","time":1498243324,"title":"Tell HN: Travis Kalanick is a Winner","type":"story"},{"by":"philip1209","descendants":430,"id":14621397,"kids":[14621712,14622281,14625661,14624004,14621862,14623345,14624835,14621466,14624283,14621624,14622883,14639684,14623388,14621871,14624269,14621817,14625871,14624124,14621928,14621816,14622008,14621517,14621885,14621912,14623595,14625078,14624210,14623423,14624346,14622272,14622168,14621609,14621784],"score":467,"time":1498241960,"title":"6 Women Accuse Tech VC Justin Caldbeck of Sexual Assault and Harassment","type":"story","url":"http://observer.com/2017/06/justin-caldbeck-binary-capital-sexual-assault-harssment/"},{"by":"okket","descendants":9,"id":14621359,"kids":[14623135,14626260,14623005,14623638],"score":67,"time":1498241621,"title":"Is Basho dead?","type":"story","url":"https://twitter.com/_jared/status/878036763805048832"},{"by":"larryfreeman","descendants":2,"id":14621335,"kids":[14621419,14624295],"score":9,"text":"A friend and I were talking about putting together a project that crowdsources cool technology topics that leveraged the latest algorithms.<p>I&#x27;m assuming that we should use something like Pytorch and possibly leverage the great work done by Yan Lecun.<p>What deep learning algorithms are recommended for this project?

If I could have foreseen these decisions before writing code, or even just realized while writing code that I was making decisions that I ought to stop and think about, I wouldn&#x27;t have made these more complicating choices, and wouldn&#x27;t have had to spend all this time reworking my code.<p>(Of course, if I can learn a good lesson from this, the time will not have been wasted. Hence this post.)<p>The thing is: We&#x27;d spent significant time planning the structure of this project, with (I&#x27;d thought) clear documents and diagrams explaining what components we needed and how they would interact. When I started coding, I felt pretty well prepared, and confident that the thing would basically write itself.<p>So, HN: What steps do you take before setting out to write code? Are there principles that you use to decide that your plan&#x2F;design is sufficiently detailed?<p>And, assuming there will be cases when the plan does not anticipate all design decisions: When you&#x27;re coding, how do you avoid making decisions that will waste a lot of your time?","time":1498224027,"title":"Ask HN: What do you do before you start writing

really angry.  I&#x27;ve asked for this from Chrome developers multiple times: when my chrome windows - all of them - crash in private mode, I want to be able to reopen them, because I didn&#x27;t close them.<p>I&#x27;ve just lost over 10 hours of reading that I had opened to work through.  (Part of many reasons that I use private mode is that I don&#x27;t like autocomplete and when I&#x27;m done reading about a subject I can simply remember it, I never need it to pop up when I start typing in the URL bar, etc etc.  If I need something permanently, I save it.)<p>So since Chrome developers don&#x27;t seem to be able to understand the difference, maybe I&#x27;m missing something.  Does anyone know why they cannot differentiate a Crash from me closing private windows?  The promise when you open such a tab is &quot;Pages you view in incognito tabs won’t stick around in your browser’s history, cookie store, or search history after you’ve closed all of your incognito tabs&quot; and not &quot;... after you’ve closed all of your incognito tabs OR THE BROWSER CRASHES.&quot;<p>This is extremely frustrating.  This was very important reading for me that I spent many hours collecting so that I could focus on it.  I have tried add-ons and they don&#x27;t work.  I just want Chrome to meet its promise and have these tabs and windows open untiL <i>I</i> (not a crash) has closed all of them.  They could at least make it an option.<p>I hope someone can clear up my thinking.  I&#x27;ve just lost a devastating amount of my time.  Now all I have is a paper checklist of the subjects, for me to again repeat my background research into.  This doesn&#x27;t seem a fair burden on the user, to have to use a pen and paper to do Chrome&#x27;s developers&#x27; job for them: <i>i.e.</i> to let me read what I&#x27;ve opened and not close it and make it disappear without any way to get it back, and not at my request.<p>Do I really need to use pen and paper here? At least let me set this behavior as an option.","time":1498195182,"title":"Ask HN: Why can't Chrome understand difference in closing windows and crashes?","type":"story"},{"by":"yooptimism","descendants":2,"id":14617247,"kids":[14617324,14617509],"score":3,"text":"I work for one of the so called tech giant that&#x27;s has taken over the world.

In fact sometimes I want to walk away from the interviews unless I am in the range of decent ranking topcoder and that makes me question the whole cs career has come to be i.e. does one have to be an elite competition level coder and only then have a fair chance to work in the top companies and whether this really translates to great software contribution.","time":1498172126,"title":"Ask HN: What have the s/w interviews evolved to :(","type":"story"},{"by":"notainc","descendants":1,"id":14615807,"kids":[14615814,14615927],"score":5,"time":1498170664,"title":"Scrapbox – A new style of note-taking where teams and ideas connect","type":"story","url":"https://scrapbox.io"},{"by":"happy-go-lucky","descendants":12,"id":14615785,"kids":[14618661,14617650,14619436,14619908,14619900],"score":32,"time":1498170474,"title":"Man Accused of Making Millions of Robocalls Faces Biggest-Ever FCC Fine","type":"story","url":"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/06/22/533970545/man-accused-of-making-millions-of-robocalls-faces-biggest-ever-fcc-fine"},{"by":"blacksmythe","descendants":27,"id":14615694,"kids":[14615770,14615842,14615887,14617805,14615910,14615827,14615873,14615802,14615794,14617700,14615874],"score":25,"time":1498169292,"title":"Go is Not Python","type":"story","url":"http://www.seanhelvey.com/go-is-not-python"},{"by":"pencilpup223","descendants":21,"id":14615642,"kids":[14615973,14618462,14616672,14616421,14616579,14615859],"score":47,"time":1498168571,"title":"Traders lost millions in ethereum crash","type":"story","url":"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/heres-how-traders-lost-millions-in-the-first-ethereum-flash-crash"},{"by":"Ajedi32","descendants":37,"id":14615414,"kids":[14615695,14616062,14616110,14616010,14615843,14615797,14616915,14616309,14617655,14616384],"score":72,"time":1498166023,"title":"Digital security and due process: A new legal framework for the cloud era","type":"story","url":"https://blog.google/topics/public-policy/digital-security-and-due-process-new-legal-framework-cloud-era/"},{"by":"jonsouth","descendants":44,"id":14615591,"kids":[14616033,14615957,14615917,14616080,14616227,14615935],"score":132,"time":1498167896,"title":"Linksys CherryBlossom Advisory","type":"story","url":"http://www.linksys.com/us/support-article?articleNum=263800"},{"by":"capybaraz","descendants":3,"id":14615214,"kids":[14615621,14616154,14617223],"score":23,"time":1498164335,"title":"Binary Cap's Justin Caldbeck accused of sexual advances towards female founders","type":"story","url":"https://pando.com/2017/06/22/binary-capitals-justin-caldbeck-accused-unwanted-sexual-advances-towards-female-founders-wheres-outrage/"},{"by":"greeneggs","descendants":34,"id":14615163,"kids":[14615490,14615500,14615756,14615699,14618079,14615564,14615594,14615535],"score":37,"time":1498163938,"title":"How Tinder could take back the White House","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/22/opinion/how-tinder-could-take-back-the-white-house.html"},{"by":"jotto","descendants":39,"id":14615084,"kids":[14615374,14615239,14615292,14618538,14615378,14615514,14618193,14617895,14615344],"score":90,"time":1498163362,"title":"Chrome 59 with TurboFan is Sometimes Slower than 58","type":"story","url":"https://www.prerender.cloud/blog/2017/06/22/chrome-59-is-sometimes-slower"},{"by":"merraksh","descendants":21,"id":14614863,"kids":[14618189,14617064,14617674,14618376,14616994,14617502,14623457],"score":47,"time":1498161531,"title":"US court grants Elsevier millions in damages from Sci-Hub","type":"story","url":"http://www.nature.com/news/us-court-grants-elsevier-millions-in-damages-from-sci-hub-1.22196"},{"by":"pavlakoos","descendants":4,"id":14614766,"kids":[14614873,14614892],"score":2,"time":1498160681,"title":"Uber is bouncing back, not going under","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@piotrpawlak/uber-is-bouncing-back-not-going-under-c3e78dfb10ec"},{"by":"rootsudo","descendants":16,"id":14614672,"kids":[14617825,14622712,14632422,14614908,14620767,14623259,14630140,14637656,14619314,14623754,14620268],"score":17,"text":"For me, it was yesterday on GDAX.<p>What are the best ways to improve myself over it?<p>The amount loss wasn&#x27;t much, but stings.","time":1498159825,"title":"Ask HN: Any of you took a loss while trading?

However, the employer thinks otherwise and sees this as a clear lack of trust from my side.<p>My questions:<p>Is my request unreasonable?<p>Do really all YC startups use Clerky for legal documents and the documents are standard and fixed and cannot be amended?<p>Is the employer reasonable in saying that my request to include the agreed upon terms in the offer indicates the lack of trust from my side (while personally my request doesn&#x27;t arise from a lack of trust)?","time":1498149119,"title":"Do all YC startups use Clerky and have the same style of terms in offer letters?","type":"story"},{"by":"aaronchall","descendants":8,"id":14613357,"kids":[14613642,14613598,14613803,14613666,14613743,14615199],"score":65,"time":1498148803,"title":"Linus Torvalds Explains How Linux Still Surprises and Motivates Him","type":"story","url":"https://www.linux.com/blog/event/lc3-china/20176/6/linus-torvalds-explains-how-linux-still-surprises-and-motivates-him"},{"by":"arishi","descendants":2,"id":14613320,"kids":[14613876,14613339],"score":4,"time":1498148538,"title":"A Growing Cancer: Forbes’ Midas List","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@chamath/a-growing-cancer-forbes-midas-list-54b2744d6271"},{"by":"drpgq","descendants":11,"id":14613268,"kids":[14613714,14613722,14613683],"score":11,"time":1498148118,"title":"Canadian elite special forces sniper makes record-breaking kill shot in Iraq","type":"story","url":"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/canadian-elite-special-forces-sniper-sets-record-breaking-kill-shot-in-iraq/article35415651/"},{"by":"deliriousferret","descendants":4,"id":14613174,"kids":[14622074,14613350,14613294],"score":2,"text":"For an e-commerce website, how would you store products&#x27; price in DB? decimal? pence integer?","time":1498147339,"title":"Ask HN: Store price as integer or decimal?","type":"story"},{"by":"snowy","descendants":79,"id":14613180,"kids":[14613680,14613766,14614498,14613709,14613572,14613917,14614361,14614348,14613993,14613898,14613896,14614005,14613997,14615618,14616921,14613806,14613894,14614419,14614068,14614228,14613583],"score":142,"time":1498147432,"title":"Why So Many Top Hackers Hail from Russia","type":"story","url":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/06/why-so-many-top-hackers-hail-from-russia/"},{"by":"podgib","descendants":106,"id":14613142,"kids":[14616700,14620024,14616098,14615504,14618666,14616363,14617003,14615872,14620510,14622533,14619642,14615541,14615615,14617134,14615623,14615631],"score":154,"time":1498147124,"title":"A new approach to text rendering","type":"story","url":"http://blog.atom.io/2017/06/22/a-new-approach-to-text-rendering.html"},{"by":"feconroses","descendants":60,"id":14613139,"kids":[14614520,14613556,14613984,14613964,14614115,14617857,14613368,14613832],"score":292,"time":1498147101,"title":"An Introduction to Support Vector Machines","type":"story","url":"https://monkeylearn.com/blog/introduction-to-support-vector-machines-svm/"},{"by":"dmohs","descendants":2,"id":14613156,"kids":[14613160,14627343],"score":9,"time":1498147209,"title":"Show HN: React CLJS.

You want to give them the widest choice of installation options possible including shared hosting, VPS or on installation on their own server.<p>The shared hosting option is probably the easiest for most users. In the case of PHP, it can be as simple as uploading files to the folder on the server. And that&#x27;s it. (Even that might be too complicated for some users.)<p>But why is it so much more complicated with other languages? Even web-friendly languages like Python and Ruby rarely let you simply upload files to a folder and be done with it.<p>The topic of decentralisation sometimes pops up on Hacker news. You could argue that shared hosting is a form or decentralisation. It may not be the &#x27;pure&#x27; solution for decentralisation, but it is a practical and realistic option for people to self-install software.<p>Wordpress is an example of a profitable open source app that can easily be installed on countless shared hosting platforms. It&#x27;s easy to switch hosting providers when you want to (and to take your data with you). Is it the ultimate example of a decentralised app?<p>Having a ridiculously easy web app installation process for servers would unlock countless opportunities for developers to reach more users or customers.<p>If you&#x27;re a server-side web developer, is this something you think about?

Many of them are older, and I&#x27;m contemplating getting rid of those to free up shelf space for other uses, but I&#x27;m not sure which to get rid of, and how to get rid of them, so I&#x27;m curious what others here do.<p>On the question of which to get rid of, the candidates fall into two groups.<p>1. Technologies that are pretty much dead now. It&#x27;s very hard to imagine that I&#x27;m ever again going to need to crack open &quot;Undocumented DOS&quot; or &quot;Inside AppleTalk&quot;, for example.<p>2. Technologies that are still in use, but my books cover older editions. For example, I have the second and third editions of Stroustrup&#x27;s &quot;The C++ Programming Language&quot;, and also several other C++ books from that era. I haven&#x27;t done C++ in long enough that I&#x27;ve largely forgotten the language, and will probably need to relearn it at some point.<p>C++ has grown a lot since those books were written, but it seems much of what is in them would still be valid, and one might even argue that for something like this learning an older, simpler version first might be better.<p>For getting rid of books, the obvious thing that comes to mind is tossing them in the recycling bin. Mine takes paperbacks, and hardbacks if the covers are removed first, so this would be easy.<p>A coworker suggests trying to sell them to a used bookstore or giving them to a used bookstore if they don&#x27;t want to buy them. I don&#x27;t like that, at least for books in the first category above, because they could end up bought by someone trying to get into technology who doesn&#x27;t realize that these are dead technologies.","time":1497974004,"title":"Ask HN: What do you do with old technical

We save international travelers hours of time by greeting them at their arrival gate, expediting the immigration&#x2F;customs process, and making sure they&#x27;re safely in their vehicle heading to their destination. We’re available in nearly 500 airports around the world, and we help with departures and connections too.<p>Our service sounds like it&#x27;d be expensive, but it is actually quite reasonable for someone who&#x27;s already traveling internationally. For instance, our service for two people arriving in London costs $225 and in Hong Kong it costs $210. It&#x27;s about $75&#x2F;person from there. Many of our clients are business travelers and families, but we can help anyone who values their time and&#x2F;or wants some extra assistance getting through the airport.<p>I stumbled upon this idea when a friend and I were flying from Seoul to Bangkok. I wondered if there was a way for us to get through customs more quickly, so I searched Google and found a (rather shady-looking!) website for a company that said it could help. I took the risk of giving this company our passport and credit card details, and amazingly, it all worked out. When we arrived, an agent met us at the gate, we were whisked through the airport process in minutes, and the agent helped us get a taxi to our hotel.<p>I wanted to book the service for other trips, but there was no easy way to do it. So, my co-founders (Shawn and Justin) and I built Solve.

However, my agreement (expectably) says that all the code that I create at work belongs to the employer, so right now I&#x27;m trying to create PRs on weekends to not get into troubles. My boss agrees that it is a problem and said that we can modify my agreement.<p>Although I understand that I need a lawyer the country where the company is registered to do actual modification of the

It just seems like not having to worry about dealing with issues in the office would tremendously boost my and the office managers productivity, hence keen to try this.","time":1497738706,"title":"Ask HN: Is 'Handy.com for offices' a viable business idea?","type":"story"},{"by":"tokenadult","descendants":17,"id":14577901,"kids":[14578722,14579173,14578038,14578888],"score":13,"time":1497736679,"title":"There’s still no good reason to believe black-white IQ differences due to genes","type":"story","url":"https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/6/15/15797120/race-black-white-iq-response-critics"},{"by":"ForHackernews","descendants":53,"id":14577881,"kids":[14578139,14578877,14578419,14579786,14580605,14580265,14580101,14580736,14581934,14580148,14578276,14578286,14579787],"score":86,"time":1497736289,"title":"Minitel, the Open Network Before the Internet","type":"story","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/06/minitel/530646/?single_page=true"},{"by":"prostoalex","descendants":58,"id":14577873,"kids":[14578011,14577957,14578099,14577966,14577929,14578301,14577943,14578078,14580930,14578245,14578012,14579844,14577964,14578212,14578506,14579253,14578272,14578070],"score":173,"time":1497736193,"title":"Low-cost DIY electric car made from recycled parts","type":"story","url":"http://www.designboom.com/technology/low-cost-diy-electric-car-made-from-recycled-parts-380-mile-range-06-17-2017/"},{"by":"robschia","descendants":76,"id":14577859,"kids":[14578075,14578057,14578152,14578000,14577991,14577983,14577986,14578096,14578325,14578478,14578211,14578014,14586377,14602957,14580908,14578155,14580559,14578161,14578510,14578010,14583356,14579081,14577999,14578268,14581120,14578095,14578431,14578107,14578040,14578116,14578267,14579028,14578261,14578347,14578025,14578307,14578457,14578092,14596511,14578056,14578985,14578151,14586332,14578159,14578058,14578090,14579720,14578043],"score":129,"text":"If so, what tools do you use, apart from to-do lists?","time":1497735763,"title":"Ask HN: Do you plan your next day ahead?","type":"story"},{"by":"dpflan","descendants":76,"id":14577828,"kids":[14578229,14579006,14578225,14578359,14578442,14578300,14580354,14578149],"score":218,"time":1497735185,"title":"European Parliament Draft to Enforce End-To-End Encryption for Citizens' Privacy","type":"story","url":"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-%2F%2FEP%2F%2FNONSGML%2BCOMPARL%2BPE-606.011%2B01%2BDOC%2BPDF%2BV0%2F%2FEN"},{"by":"RA_Fisher","descendants":72,"id":14577816,"kids":[14578290,14578565,14578120,14578209,14578311,14578571,14578815,14578228,14578538,14578393,14579477,14578181,14578437],"score":148,"time":1497735016,"title":"What's Y Combinator's conversion rate?","type":"story","url":"http://statwonk.com/yc.nb.html"},{"by":"alexandru88","descendants":5,"id":14577725,"kids":[14577880,14578491,14578067],"score":4,"text":"On a platform that connects start-up founders I got many requests for a technical co-founder role in different start-ups.<p>By talking to the founders of the start-ups about their business model and so on, I realized that these founders are not aware of what they are doing.

reseller of items from a single supplier. Said supplier provides a ~25,000 line Excel sheet with SKU info on a sporadic basis. The number of available SKUs goes up and down. The Excel sheet is valid until a newer one supersedes it.<p>I currently take the supplied Excel workbook, keep it native Excel and run various calculations, transformations and formulae across it to make suitable input CSVs for Magento Community Edition, eBay and Amazon.<p>My issue is that the spreadsheet has passed 100MB and the quantity of calculations is making it unwieldy and difficult. File -&gt; Save takes close to 90 seconds (i7 4790K, 32GB RAM, Excel 2016), and Excel is unusable during this time.<p>I&#x27;m using Excel because a) the source material and and CSV output for the various platforms are easily made from it and b) I know Excel pretty well. This thing has morphed into a catch-all tool for what I do, and I fear Stockholm Syndrome is creeping in. It&#x27;s portable at the moment, rather than being spread across 5 different workbooks<p>My question: what should I consider for alternatives? I am coming to a point where I can afford the time to learn a new thing, should that be more appropriate.<p>If Excel is the answer, that&#x27;s absolutely fine, too -- your advice and feedback is very much appreciated.<p>Thanks in advance, and happy weekend to you.<p>Edit: macOS is my primary platform, I have a recent-ish i5 ready to go with Windows, Linux or something else Intel-y.","time":1497640193,"title":"Ask HN: Advice on potential alternative tools for managing supplier SKU data","type":"story"},{"by":"geetfun","descendants":6,"id":14571803,"kids":[14573185,14576087,14573133,14571816],"score":7,"time":1497639926,"title":"Michelle Carter guilty of manslaughter in texting suicide case","type":"story","url":"http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/16/us/michelle-carter-texting-case/index.html"},{"by":"prismatic","descendants":26,"id":14571785,"kids":[14572701,14572687,14572843,14576996,14572528,14573192,14572480,14573472,14572606],"score":22,"time":1497639765,"title":"How Do You Conserve Art Made of Bologna, or Bubble Gum, or Soap?","type":"story","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/06/how-do-you-conserve-art-made-of-bologna-or-bubble-gum-or-soap/529713?single_page=true"},{"by":"dashwin","descendants":4,"id":14571725,"kids":[14572331,14572433],"score":9,"text":"Just got hit with a scam from a Chinese registrar company [1] telling me that my domain name in other countries (eg. domain.cn or domain.com.dn) is being taken over by a Chinese company.<p>After doing some research [2] this is a complete scam.

Py is an education app for iOS and Android that teaches topics like app development, building websites and data science. We&#x27;re in the current YC batch.<p>My co-founder Will and I have been friends since high school. We&#x27;ve been frustrated for a long time with the way existing learning platforms teach coding. They tend to be one-size-fits-all solutions that don&#x27;t make learning to code a fun experience. Also, most platforms don&#x27;t personalize content based on a user&#x27;s prior skill level or behavior within the product.<p>We think personalizing content is key. We customize the content that users see and make it game-like to encourage people to spend more time on concepts they’re struggling with.<p>We also believe that interactivity is super important. Rather than passively watching a video, we want users to engage with the content. I’ve found from personal experience that I’ll watch an EdX video thinking I understand what they’re saying, only to discover later that I’m struggling on a quiz about the exact same concepts I thought I had learned.<p>When we first launched Py on the App Store about one year ago, it was named Pythonic because it only taught Python. Over the summer, we expanded to teach more programming languages and shortened the name to Py. While finishing up our last year of college we iterated on the product, developing more interaction types to make learning more engaging, and building more courses.<p>Excited to discuss mobile edtech and teaching people how to code!

For ~6 months, my co-founder and I did not pay ourselves and ran through a lot of our savings. We soon got accepted into a top tech incubator and were able to use their small investment to keep running. After graduating from the incubator and without even really trying, an investment of more than $1 million fell into our laps. Shortly after, a very successful company contacted us about a potential acquisition and after two months of talking extended a &quot;low-ish ball&quot; acquihire offer to myself and my co-founder.<p>I wish we had the momentum and growth to comfortably pass on the offer but the reality is that we have not had much confidence in the business for a while. Even before the investment fell into our lap we considered &quot;pivoting&quot; to an entirely new idea because we were so frustrated with the highly competitive market in which we were operating. The acquiring company now also has plans to enter our market and it would be very difficult to compete.<p>The terms of the deal allow us to mostly pay back our investors in full and would line us up with great jobs. It is not the exit we dreamed of but it gives us a nice story for the future and allows us to &quot;wipe our hands clean&quot;.<p>We have been working 80+ hours weeks without weekends and extremely low pay. My health has been declining (I was recently injured and need surgery but cannot without better insurance) and I had to move away from friends and family. I&#x27;m still young but my savings have essentially run out and I have become somewhat disillusioned by startup life.<p>Is it time to call it quits?<p>Thoughts?","time":1497305839,"title":"Ask HN:

I find a growing number of organizational leaders who, while still a minority, feel they are part of a profound evolution in the nature of work as a social institution. “Why can’t we do good works at work?”&quot;","time":1497284062,"title":"Ask HN: Alternatives to work/life balance?","type":"story"},{"by":"cloudbeary","descendants":46,"id":14538226,"kids":[14539442,14540930,14538842,14539150,14539348,14538665,14542916,14538882,14543291,14539284,14539629,14543137,14543279,14539268,14541428,14538836,14540707,14544542,14538750,14538969],"score":145,"time":1497282698,"title":"Show HN: Kooba, an interactive graph for finding new books","type":"story","url":"http://koob.jake.run"},{"by":"chrisaycock","descendants":47,"id":14538357,"kids":[14538986,14539186,14538556,14539410,14539438,14539529,14539293,14539011],"score":49,"time":1497283601,"title":"New Kids on the Block: Understanding Developers Entering the Workforce Today","type":"story","url":"https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/06/12/new-kids-block-understanding-developers-entering-workforce-today/"},{"by":"ezekg","descendants":90,"id":14538351,"kids":[14544440,14541572,14539871,14542225,14543143,14542730,14540323,14544053,14538585,14545277,14539664,14542137,14543811,14542918,14546940,14544079,14542667],"score":190,"time":1497283554,"title":"Show HN: Keygen – A dead-simple software licensing API built for developers","type":"story","url":"https://keygen.sh"},{"by":"deegles","descendants":85,"id":14538332,"kids":[14538867,14538841,14538829,14539791,14538798,14538593,14539061,14538673,14538776,14539324,14540340,14539640,14539557,14538723,14538961,14540239],"score":119,"time":1497283364,"title":"Weight Training Is the Best Exercise for Bone Strength","type":"story","url":"http://time.com/4803697/bodybuilding-strength-training/?utm_source=pocket&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=pockethits"},{"by":"senoff","descendants":3,"id":14538122,"kids":[14541049,14540878],"score":13,"time":1497281990,"title":"Show HN: Ramp Receipts – Free receipts dashboard and PDFs for stripe","type":"story","url":"https://rampreceipts.com/"},{"by":"minimaxir","descendants":27,"id":14538086,"kids":[14539544,14538387,14538459,14538983,14539185,14565357,14538656,14538729],"score":131,"time":1497281760,"title":"Benchmarking CNTK on Keras: Is It Better at Deep Learning Than TensorFlow?","type":"story","url":"http://minimaxir.com/2017/06/keras-cntk/"},{"by":"itsdrewmiller","descendants":264,"id":14538074,"kids":[14538599,14541565,14539054,14538761,14539149,14538494,14539008,14539465,14538647,14540761,14539917,14539863,14539157,14540949,14543997,14540921,14539449,14538589,14542429,14540367,14538813,14540424,14541539,14538581,14538600,14540400,14540860,14538796,14538544,14538834,14538508],"score":330,"time":1497281642,"title":"For an Inclusive Culture, Try Working Less","type":"story","url":"https://hackernoon.com/for-inclusive-culture-maybe-less-is-more-87b663662cea"},{"by":"artsandsci","descendants":12,"id":14538038,"kids":[14542004,14542408,14541608,14542273,14542242,14542914,14542186,14543201],"score":66,"time":1497281373,"title":"Wartime Spies Who Used Knitting as an Espionage Tool","type":"story","url":"http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/knitting-spies-wwi-wwii"},{"by":"okket","descendants":61,"id":14537991,"kids":[14541964,14543831,14544287,14542105,14543672,14545170,14541865,14541667,14543301,14542288,14541993,14543261,14543299,14545656,14545051,14579627,14579629],"score":119,"time":1497280865,"title":"16 Years with IPv6","type":"story","url":"http://teamarin.net/2017/06/12/16-years-with-ipv6/"},{"by":"cucho","descendants":2,"id":14537936,"kids":[14538111,14537962],"score":4,"text":"I&#x27;m thinking of tackling these two problems:<p>(1) Ideas happen anywhere, anytime (running, in the shower, driving, etc).

We decided to bootstrap the mvp, get it launched, and then see where to take it from there (probably continuing to bootstrap until it seemed viable as a real business).<p>I, being the programmer, of course had to build it, with my partner being the domain expert (and non-technical) would handle all business and marketing stuff. The understanding was that since we were building this on the side of our day jobs we would just work on it in each of our free times.<p>At first it went really well, my partner was engaged and got a lot done. After a few months, though, his enthusiasm fizzled. I myself took about a month and a half off from the project to focus on a talk I was giving, so I wasn&#x27;t judging him harshly, but since that time he hasn&#x27;t done very much. Some of the tasks we talked about him doing back in March still haven&#x27;t been done, to my knowledge, at all.  And where we used to talk about our company all of the time (again, we have been friends prior to this), we now never talk about it unless I bring it up.<p>I&#x27;ve tried a couple of times to give him outs; asking him when he&#x27;ll have time to work on the project and (hoping he would say that he doesn&#x27;t have time in the immediate future) wanting to bring up that maybe it&#x27;s not a good time for him... but every time I&#x27;ve alluded to this he says that he&#x27;s going to work on it tomorrow, or the day after that, but he never does.<p>At this point I don&#x27;t know what to do. I feel like he still likes the idea of our company but doesn&#x27;t want to put any work into it. I absolutely do not want to launch this product if I&#x27;ve done all of the work but do not have 100% equity. We&#x27;ve missed several soft deadlines because of this, and I find myself even slowing down because there&#x27;s little for me left to do.

Ideally, someone watching would have answers to things you are stuck on, so you spend time less time looking for answers.<p>Of course, this is incredibly high pressure. Not many can work long hours under the pressure that others are watching. To compensate that issue, let us assume that you get paid per time spent streaming at a very high payout (the appropriate amount is up to your discretion).

And I&#x27;m having feelings about the industry I don&#x27;t know how to address.<p>I recently noted this situation[0], and whilst I noted people were (rightfully) outraged, I was confused by the surprise. All I would think was &quot;well that&#x27;s every CTO ever, what&#x27;s the shock here?&quot;.<p>I recently did a phone interview for a security role. When I mentioned to their &quot;technical manager&quot; that I had several CVEs I had found, he said &quot;noone in real security cares about that&quot; and went on to describe their penetration testing methodology, which meant basically reading out this disaster[1] word for word. My eyes glazed at that point and even after telling them I&#x27;m not interested, they&#x27;ve continued to pursue me. Likewise, a tech startup many of you may recognise approached me for a devops role. When I found out their production servers were whitebox desktops running Windows XP (and they strictly did not intend on changing that) I bailed.<p>These things are simply examples of the things I&#x27;ve been seeing for years, and I&#x27;ve gotten so jaded about how the average company carries themselves I just can&#x27;t consider any role seriously any more. I find it incredibly difficult to talk to a hiring manager and not sit and scoff because I feel like I know what&#x27;s coming.

wanted to attend Hack Reactor in March 2016 but ended up at DevMountain. After asking a question on Quora, one of the founders of DevMountain said &#x27;our curriculum is just as good but also has free housing&#x27;. I fell for it to save money (HR was only at SF at the time) and moved to Provo, Utah. I was doing really well but felt like I got ripped off for several reasons (the hiring stats were greatly exaggerated, the curriculum was not as quality as promised, they got acquired midway through my cohort, and I had a sociopathic ex-mormon roommate).<p>Long story short: I got a full refund. I don&#x27;t want to make this about DevMountain. I want to focus on Hack Reactor or something close.<p>I didn&#x27;t go back home, I lived out of AirBnb for 2 months and landed a dev job at a shady MLM company. I learned a lot there but it was potentially a Ponzi scheme, so I bailed after a few months alongside most of the other devs. Next, I worked at a Bluehost call center where I focused on Wordpress support and planned out some new ideas in my free time. There was a mass layoff in January of this year and my last day was 3&#x2F;31. I tried and failed to get into YC as well, it was a crap shoot but I tried anyways.<p>I&#x27;m back where I started from and now doing HR&#x27;s prep course (free) while hoping to build a passion project into a viable company. I&#x27;ve thought this over a lot but I think I should try one more time and this time not be so naive.<p>I&#x27;m overcoming depression&#x2F;burn out&#x2F;disillusionment by taking good care of myself, learning code, designing stuff, and spending time with my family. I think I can do this if I try with beginner&#x27;s mind and listen to whatever is posted here.<p>I sincerely appreciate any and all advice, encouragement, and direction.
