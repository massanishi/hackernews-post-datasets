Also, recruiters often set the bar very high: you are expected to know a considerable number of programming languages and frameworks, and previous experience in other jobs.<p>If you have experienced this transition, I&#x27;d like to know more about how you dealt with it.","time":1591928486,"title":"Ask HN: How to land a job after finishing a PhD?","type":"story"},{"by":"collinmanderson","descendants":7,"id":23495086,"kids":[23496417,23495087,23495489],"score":21,"time":1591925532,"title":"Covid-19: Straight Answers from Top Epidemiologist Who Predicted the Pandemic","type":"story","url":"https://www.bluezones.com/2020/06/covid-19-straight-answers-from-top-epidemiologist-who-predicted-the-pandemic/"},{"by":"helloiloveyou","descendants":41,"id":23495084,"kids":[23496309,23497889,23496324,23496061,23498592,23496617,23495491,23495428,23495994,23495368,23497339,23496303,23497196,23496306,23501676,23495529,23497719,23495731,23497811,23495706,23496378,23495920],"score":177,"time":1591925511,"title":"How to implement search-by-color when all you have is a good coffee","type":"story","url":"https://www.mikealche.com/software-development/how-to-implement-search-by-color-when-all-you-have-is-a-good-coffee"},{"by":"softwaredoug","dead":true,"id":23495204,"kids":[23495353,23495552],"score":7,"time":1591926803,"title":"The successful 70-year campaign to convince people USA and not USSR beat Hitler","type":"story","url":"https://www.vox.com/2014/6/16/5814270/the-successful-70-year-campaign-to-convince-people-the-usa-and-not"},{"by":"kdrag0n","descendants":537,"id":23495052,"kids":[23497749,23496349,23496286,23497268,23495438,23496592,23496913,23495347,23495651,23501156,23496455,23497248,23495633,23497232,23496342,23498694,23495896,23495346,23495996,23496462,23499935,23495541,23500414,23496033,23498301,23495350,23495348,23495930,23495846,23497726,23496122,23496922,23497802,23497452,23499041,23496553,23496631,23499782,23495282,23500489,23500336,23500398,23496461,23496379,23496503,23496067,23495549,23496848,23496459,23497592,23499287,23498670,23495324,23496302,23497192,23499381,23495616,23497334,23497541,23498852,23496016,23496873,23495855,23496322,23497680,23497706,23500352,23497404,23499160,23495878,23502094,23496524,23497681,23522140,23497012,23499489,23496808,23496355,23497778,23495874,23496483,23498174,23499304,23496546,23498346,23498393,23496741,23496716,23498364,23497233,23500250,23497908,23499975,23498573,23500537,23509261,23497700,23500127,23500023,23499897,23500012,23496907,23497279,23498424,23511142,23502279,23498682,23497678,23497656,23498244,23499404,23498178,23495760,23497136,23498651,23501625,23498400,23497345,23499361,23496782,23497835,23503378,23497770,23496801,23496578,23496602,23496557,23499436,23502553,23500741,23499915,23499163,23501859,23495716,23497976,23496519,23497608,23496221,23497208,23497060,23496279,23500619,23496832,23496386,23499047,23501751,23496555,23500056,23501429,23500030,23495772,23498417,23497846,23497766,23502734,23499370,23502647,23497937,23497034,23496665,23499382,23495856],"score":442,"time":1591925171,"title":"Is Dark Mode Such a Good Idea?","type":"story","url":"https://kevq.uk/is-dark-mode-such-a-good-idea/"},{"by":"yuningalexliu","descendants":3,"id":23494978,"kids":[23499567,23510167],"score":8,"text":"I&#x27;m currently a PM at a FAANG company, but I&#x27;ve always been curious about switching to engineering.

Every month they host a broadcast to the entire company to talk about miscellaneous topics, most recent of which has been about the protests. On today&#x27;s broadcast, various high-ups shared their position on the usage of &quot;All Lives Matter&quot;. All of those who shared their thoughts made it clear that the statement &quot;All Lives Matter&quot; categorically belongs to the &quot;red zone&quot;, which is defined as &quot;illegal and toxic because the incidents are more frequent or severe&quot;. In other words, residing within this spectrum is within bounds of justification for severe repercussions or even firing. Stating &quot;Black Lives Matter&quot;, however, is clearly within the &quot;green zone&quot;, as is openly stated and encouraged. This isn&#x27;t codified as official policy yet, but the verbalization of it makes it clear HR will act as if it were.<p>I felt compelled to share this because I have found it to be deeply concerning. The intent of this post isn&#x27;t whether &quot;All Lives Matter&quot; or &quot;Black Lives Matter&quot; is the morally superior position, but rather is about the fact that one can now face serious repercussions for holding the wrong political opinion based on what management subjectively interprets as its meaning, all the while a different political opinion is openly endorsed and encouraged without consequence. I have felt a sudden chill today like no other. Political discourse in the company is becoming more common, open and encouraged, but it is clear only those with a particular political bent are allowed to engage. Others that I know who also work within the tech industry are seeing the same swift culture change within their own organizations. After watching this broadcast, I happened to stumble upon this article which I cannot help but make parallels with https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;the-medias-self-censors-11591829694?mod=hp_opin_pos_2.<p>I am curious to know if any of you are witnessing the same changes and have the same concerns.","time":1591852083,"title":"Stating “All Lives Matter” Is in the “Red Zone” at Work.

If so, for which languages might you?\nIs this worth thinking about more?","time":1591815962,"title":"Ask HN: Should we coordinate to switch to more productive languages?","type":"story"},{"by":"sajid","descendants":134,"id":23480680,"kids":[23481311,23482038,23481374,23481346,23481849,23481378,23482540,23481348,23481526,23482921,23497825,23481277,23500501,23481801,23483970,23481666,23481468,23482263,23481325],"score":135,"time":1591815168,"title":"The Looming Bank Collapse","type":"story","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/07/coronavirus-banks-collapse/612247/"},{"by":"cmacole","descendants":2,"id":23480647,"kids":[23480656,23488194],"score":9,"time":1591814958,"title":"Show HN: Generate piano songs and sheet music with Music Transformer","type":"story","url":"https://www.deepsoundsai.com/"},{"by":"headalgorithm","descendants":23,"id":23480604,"kids":[23480803,23480848,23480879,23498686,23480920,23482407,23483900],"score":18,"time":1591814688,"title":"Apple is now worth 1.5T dollars","type":"story","url":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/today-apple-became-the-first-us-company-worth-1-5-trillion/"},{"by":"open-source-ux","descendants":2,"id":23480313,"kids":[23480401,23480402],"score":3,"time":1591813125,"title":"Former UK scientific advisor: 'Earlier lockdown would have halved death toll'","type":"story","url":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52995064"},{"by":"docdeek","descendants":11,"id":23480265,"kids":[23480279,23480844,23482282,23481981],"score":14,"time":1591812813,"title":"Three Simple Rules Poor Teens Should Follow to Join the Middle Class (2013)","type":"story","url":"https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/three-simple-rules-poor-teens-should-follow-to-join-the-middle-class/"},{"by":"illuminated","descendants":74,"id":23480198,"kids":[23483977,23482509,23482803,23484364,23484757,23482643,23483565,23483436,23482580,23484456,23482767,23486398,23485561,23495857,23484510,23485963,23485164,23485721,23485947,23487253],"score":147,"time":1591812485,"title":"Speeding up a Git monorepo","type":"story","url":"https://dropbox.tech/application/speeding-up-a-git-monorepo-at-dropbox-with--200-lines-of-code"},{"by":"ckastner","descendants":3,"id":23480118,"kids":[23480396,23480162],"score":2,"time":1591812145,"title":"Tesla shares surge past $1k as Musk revs up the Semi","type":"story","url":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-truck/tesla-shares-surge-past-1000-as-musk-revs-up-the-semi-idUSKBN23H1PEc"},{"by":"andraskindler","descendants":23,"id":23480034,"kids":[23483093,23483273,23483039,23501546,23489996,23482859,23482781,23483313,23483309],"score":49,"time":1591811812,"title":"Android 11 beta is available now","type":"story","url":"https://blog.google/products/android/android-11-beta/"},{"by":"worble","descendants":62,"id":23480002,"kids":[23487684,23486908,23486903,23487195,23486363,23485453,23488365,23486732,23488974,23486579,23486892,23492731,23488555,23488529,23493303,23485671,23488502,23487991,23486798],"score":91,"time":1591811634,"title":"The GUI should be a lot better [video]","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AItTqnTsVjA"},{"by":"AndrewDucker","descendants":30,"id":23479922,"kids":[23483159,23482982,23482684,23483357,23485124,23483441,23483253,23483257,23484815],"score":18,"time":1591811226,"title":"Reddit Ireland turns off at midnight to stop racist trolls","type":"story","url":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52992676"},{"by":"snowisgone","descendants":8,"id":23479765,"kids":[23480004,23479829,23482199],"score":2,"text":"<i>At Digg, one mentor gave me the savvy advice that the fastest path to financial success was working for four years at three different just-about-to-IPO companies.

Their inputs are what that led me to focusing on one thing (A&#x2F;B testing) and that&#x27;s how I built and launched &quot;Visual Website Optimizer&quot;(now called VWO).

All you need is a hunger to make it happen and a community (like this one) to give you honest feedback for iterating on your product. If you are what Paul Graham calls as relentless resourceful, you will build a successful business.<p>So, thank you HN! Thanks @patio11 for your feedback and initial shoutouts in 2009. And thanks Paul. Beyond YC funding, you&#x27;ve impacted lives of many other folks (like me) through your essays and by making Hn happen.<p>PS: I don&#x27;t know if this post will get any attention on HN today, but I felt like I had to do this :)","time":1591709283,"title":"Thank HN: My startup was born here and is now 10 years old","type":"story"},{"by":"mmastrac","descendants":21,"id":23466431,"kids":[23466816,23467054,23468305,23467350,23471899,23467519,23467869,23470984,23467754,23473496],"score":111,"time":1591709015,"title":"Microship.com: The Library of Technomadics","type":"story","url":"https://microship.com/"},{"by":"pratchett","descendants":2,"id":23466388,"kids":[23519016,23467420],"score":2,"text":"A friend of mine asked me for some advice regarding her son, who recently graduated high school and will be going to a good university seeking to major in Computer Science.

During my time as the helm, I&#x27;ve implemented a number of improvements to the architecture of the software (including a rewrite enabling development of Mac and web versions, based on the original PC-only version).<p>My agreements with my business partner are based on royalties (20% of all sales and renewals). He works in an office and deals with customer support, I work remotely. He covers all business costs. Our agreements included payment for development work, however then I have needed to pay these pay with reductions in royalties -&gt; I was given an interest free loan for my own salary, and eventually he&#x27;s out of pocket nothing for development costs. Total income for our royalties agreements across time equate to 2 x yearly average salaries in my home country, but spread across the last 6 years.<p>Now he&#x27;s discussed selling the business. If sold, I would receive royalties for the balance of our agreement, using the average sales for the last year.I made a mistake in that I agreed to the 20% royalty rate without negotiation initially, I know that much. I have worked many hundreds of hours under these agreements, and he agrees sales have not been as we would like - but of course, with 80% of the income, it&#x27;s still (roughly for him) 3 -&gt; 3.5 an average salary per year.<p>I wish to renegotiate our agreements to include a clause that gives me part of the sale value of the company as a cash payout, the reasoning here being that my work has increased substantially the value of the company. At say a valuation of 20 x the average salary, I was thinking of 10% i.e. two years of an average salary. I feel that my value to the company is larger than what is being recognised currently, given my contributions (i.e. every single line of code in the company&#x27;s products have been written by me).<p>Am I being unreasonable here?","time":1591703463,"title":"Ask HN: I'd appreciate advice on my current work

It’s different when everyone’s working in the same office: people naturally get to know each other through hundreds of small exchanges during the day. New employees soak the company culture at a visceral, almost magical level — similar to how children learn to talk without any systematic effort from their parents.<p>Remote work is a different matter. When all the exchanges are limited, scheduled, and happening via Zoom, little room remains for this magic to take place. Naturally, as employers, we start believing that our task to choose the RIGHT person from the very beginning becomes even more crucial.<p>I personally share the &quot;Good to Great&quot; approach, which says that your focus must be on getting the right people on the bus in the first place. If you get your recruitment right, the culture would emerge naturally - as it always does when similar-minded people are gathered in one place. Even if that &#x27;place&#x27; is virtual.<p>As an early adopter of remote work, all of my businesses have adhered to a “remote-first” protocol for the last 10 years.

Could you point me in a direction where I could research more about how to handle disagreement&#x2F;discord within management of a company? I am a software engineer who has been growing through the ranks until I reached level of management structure in our company. The company is rather young (&lt;10 years), rather small (&lt;500 employees), but not tiny any more. Currently the company follows approach that feels a bit insincere or on times even totalitarian to me - managers cannot disagree with each other in front of other employees, a manager cannot criticize management actions&#x2F;decisions. Of course, I could be completely wrong about this and it could be the best policy. Yet I&#x27;d like to learn more about this topic and adhere to it because I agree with it, not because I was once told to follow it.\nMy discontent stems from several ideas - everybody can make mistakes, a lot of decisions are really compromises with up and down sides and not silver bullets. This, together with &quot;obligation to dissent&quot; approach that I personally like, makes me believe that it&#x27;s better to be able to voice concerns and disagreements instead of hiding it. So I would prefer to have a system where management actions are seen more like a social contract that we all subscribe to (I&#x27;ve joined this company because I think it is doing a mostly good job), not a god-sent infallible order, which cannot ever be criticized.\nNow it feels like I am just trying to sum up &quot;obligation to dissent&quot; in other words :) Are there any other resources&#x2F;research&#x2F;etc to compare totalitarian style vs more open?<p>Some disclaimers:\n- I have tried searching for this topic, but didn&#x27;t find too much related stuff\n- I&#x27;m not sure how to submit to &quot;Ask HN&quot; directly, I only see the general &quot;submit&quot; button, so here we go.

I really need a job that pays me $1,000&#x2F;month so I can marry my gf (26) and live with her by the end of the year. She&#x27;s 27 next year. Here in my country, women usually get married at 22-25. I don&#x27;t want her to be sad because her friends already have babies while she doesn&#x27;t even engaged yet. I just can&#x27;t look at her eyes when she&#x27;s browsing Instagram, then her friends with their babies shows up on her feed. She&#x27;s beautiful.<p>I need to make $5,000. So I can marry her, rent a house, and start a business. I don&#x27;t have much money right now.<p>Since last year, I&#x27;ve been trying to make $5,000 but never accomplished. Here&#x27;s some of my efforts:<p>- (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kursif.com): This was my only income, $200-$250&#x2F;month. But since the global pandemic, profit is declining. April I decided to close the business. It&#x27;s just not enough to make $5,000 by the end of the year with that.<p>- (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bench.id): I love fitness, I lift weights. So I thought I can make some money doing online personal training. I never make money from it. I tried creating content on Instagram (@bench_id) since January-April, got some 119 followers but no one turned into client.<p>- (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tustel.co): Here&#x27;s my current attempt, trying to sell Instagram templates. I don&#x27;t have budget for advertising, so I think it won&#x27;t make me money anytime soon.<p>Right now, I don&#x27;t have the time to try something like doing freelance on Fiverr or something similar. I need a job that will certainly pay me $1,000&#x2F;month. I have skills in design and front-end dev. My GitHub isn&#x27;t that great.

I am imagining an app that has a real-time, location-aware feed of media references to such instances to corroborate and publicize, potentially supported by facial recognition of offenders to gather evidence of repeat abuse.","time":1591198088,"title":"Ask HN: What tools/apps/etc. are out there in support of antiracism?","type":"story"},{"by":"chidog12","descendants":42,"id":23404396,"kids":[23407067,23408186,23408725,23407867,23406495,23407632,23407434,23409021,23411645,23408902,23406814],"score":107,"time":1591197948,"title":"How We Automated 99% of Our Newsletter Business","type":"story","url":"https://thetechonomics.com/2020/06/03/how-we-automated-99-of-our-newsletter-business/"},{"by":"AndrewBissell","descendants":46,"id":23404411,"kids":[23404568,23406662,23407429,23406678,23405614,23405137,23418393,23405083],"score":107,"time":1591197997,"title":"Regulators may punish Deutsche Bank for its Jeffrey Epstein ties","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/business/jeffrey-epstein-deutsche-bank.html"},{"by":"atticusberg","descendants":5,"id":23404204,"kids":[23404542,23404512,23404963],"score":3,"time":1591196938,"title":"When silence is better for white people","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@peter_berg/when-silence-is-better-for-white-people-579345cc862f"},{"by":"dylan604","descendants":2,"id":23404044,"kids":[23406142,23404337],"score":10,"time":1591196245,"title":"Will They Suspend Me?","type":"story","url":"https://twitter.com/suspendthepres"},{"by":"tobib","descendants":65,"id":23404030,"kids":[23404540,23404599,23405127,23404378,23405921,23404903,23405321,23404962,23404364,23404573,23404664],"score":164,"time":1591196178,"title":"Twitter account reposting everything Trump tweets, suspended within 3 days","type":"story","url":"https://mashable.com/article/twitter-donald-trump-suspend-tweets-policy-violence/"},{"by":"maleno","descendants":79,"id":23403864,"kids":[23405116,23406912,23406581,23406828,23405130,23406178,23405578,23404901,23406768],"score":105,"time":1591195455,"title":"Bland God: Notes on Mark Zuckerberg (2018)","type":"story","url":"https://stingingfly.org/2018/06/27/bland-god-notes-on-mark-zuckerberg/"},{"by":"ComputerGuru","dead":true,"id":23403810,"kids":[23404171,23406224,23405254],"score":10,"time":1591195192,"title":"Police license plates in Minneapolis (2016) [video]","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuyRkbo4Lho"},{"by":"theanirudh","descendants":313,"id":23403800,"kids":[23404310,23407151,23404818,23409058,23405262,23404279,23405057,23404402,23404638,23404461,23407169,23408064,23404519,23404711,23406744,23405244,23404243,23406427,23404304,23408767,23416013,23422631,23422524,23404831,23411150,23411666,23404826],"score":591,"time":1591195112,"title":"Software Engineering Within SpaceX","type":"story","url":"https://yasoob.me/posts/software_engineering_within_spacex_launch/"},{"by":"alexpetralia","descendants":4,"id":23403754,"kids":[23404042,23405980,23421089,23404353],"score":25,"time":1591194900,"title":"WHO changed Covid-19 policy based on suspect data from tiny US company","type":"story","url":"https://theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/covid-19-surgisphere-who-world-health-organization-hydroxychloroquine"},{"by":"cracker_jacks","descendants":12,"id":23403790,"kids":[23403943,23403946,23403926,23403989,23403923,23403932],"score":36,"time":1591195072,"title":"Google faces $5B lawsuit in U.S. for tracking 'private' internet use","type":"story","url":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-google-privacy-lawsuit/google-faces-5-billion-lawsuit-in-us-for-tracking-private-internet-use-idUSKBN23933H"},{"by":"complexworld","descendants":7,"id":23403759,"kids":[23403885,23406660,23403851],"score":8,"text":"Years ago I uploaded to YouTube a 30 minute home video of my kids when they were babies.

For production&#x2F;editing these files are kept on fast SSD based storage, but after that they&#x27;re archived together with all the project files, notes etc. It&#x27;s done on normal 4TB sized spinning disks and they&#x27;re read maybe once a year when archive footage is needed for a new edit.<p>When expanding storage there was a discussion on whether backing up to AWS would be better than buying twice the amount of disks to do RAID 1. The initial idea was that non-RAID disks + AWS is better, because it&#x27;s off-site for when the building burns down, and you can make make the permissions &quot;append only&quot; so it&#x27;s much more resistant to ransomware or other issues.<p>The price of S3 Glacier Deep Archive is great at $ 0.00099 per GB per month, that&#x27;s about two years of storing 4 TB at the price of a 4 TB drive. The much feared retrieval fees in case one of our local drives is lost (crashes&#x2F;corruption happen) is $ 0.003 per GB so $ 12 to get everything back. So the fear of retrieval fees actually isn&#x27;t bad at all with the S3 Glacier Deep Archive pricing if you accept having to wait 48 hours.<p>But then comes the shocker: You&#x27;re going to pay 30 times as much as the retrieval fee to get that data out of AWS, because bandwidth is $ 0.09 per GB, so retrieving that &quot;crashed disk&quot; 4TB will cost $ 372 in total instead of just $ 12.

If your subscribers opt for SMS, they can push photos and comments to your feed by just texting them to the vzg phone number. Basically grandma texts a photo of Timmy and it automatically gets sent out to all of his subscribers (after your approval).<p>2.

I also like the approach of the chat widgets as they make it easy for users to get in touch with the people behind the app. So I tried to combine these two approaches with sleekplan.com.<p>Here are some of the main features:<p>* Collect &amp; discuss feedback with an embedded widget<p>* Calculate an impact score for feedback items based on\ndifferent factors (such as weight, users satisfaction, user engagement),<p>* Categories for different types of feedback (Feature requests, missing integrations, bugs)<p>* Custom statuses<p>* Roadmap<p>* Changelog<p>* Notify „followers“ that are watching specific feedback items on status updates<p>* Keep discussions simple (jump straight into discussions via email)<p>I initially focused on developing the tool itself. The next step is an integration to sync Github issues.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s plenty of room for improvement, so what do you think about it?

Primarily to flow unpredictably long text, and it still does that quite well.<p>It&#x27;s not great for UI layout (or art direction), which is why we needed CSS in the first place, and why CSS only gets more sophisticated (or complex, depending on your perspective) over time.<p>This is not a deal-breaker, but feels like the first smell I noticed. HTML doesn&#x27;t even have a coordinate system. The one added by CSS leans hard in the direction of providing relative, &quot;top&#x2F;right&#x2F;bottom&#x2F;left&quot; measurements, rather than absolutely X&#x2F;Y coordinates (though you can get those by jumping through some hoops).<p>The goals of creating a UI and writing semantic HTML are often at odds. It can be done (most of the time), but not without a lot of code-golf. Adding the admittedly superfluous, but sometimes required wrapper element often feels like a failure. In SVG, however, there&#x27;s absolutely nothing semantically wrong with nesting your component into a group element.<p>While the responsive features available to web developers today are incredible, it&#x27;s still hard to translate &quot;pixels&quot; into their many, context-specific definitions. If we&#x27;d been working with SVG all along, we would never have been worrying about half pixels, 2x versus 3x displays, etc. We would be thinking in vectors.<p>I&#x27;m not proposing that SVG as it stands now is a better option.  Obviously we can&#x27;t switch until we build things like forms, buttons, options, and the like in SVG. I&#x27;m wondering what the potential for an SVG-powered Web would be.<p>1. What would it look like now if we had chosen SVG over HTML 5, 10, 15 years ago? What would our tools look like now? Would web development look&#x2F;feel more like iOS&#x2F;Android development?

Since then, all my jobs for the past 57 years have involved computer programming.  I am now a data scientist developing cloud-based big data fraud detection algorithms using machine learning and other advanced analytical technologies.  Along the way, I earned a Master’s in Operations Research and a Master’s in Management Science, studied artificial intelligence for 3 years in a Ph.D. program for engineering, and just two years ago I received Graduate Certificates in Big Data Analytics from the schools of business and computer science at a local university (FAU).

A few of them takes it to the next level by converting their onsite rounds into a 5 hrs long coding project, e.g. use this mock to build a mini web app.<p>Initially, I was quite happy to welcome this trend. No LeetCode-ing, use my favorite tech stack, sharpen some fundamentals, and learn a new Web API or two. It didn&#x27;t end there, I&#x27;ve received 4 offers from companies that used a combination of take-home exercise and code-a-project during onsite.<p>Fast forward to current date, I&#x27;d discourage this approach of interviewing a candidate. Firstly, the amount of time involved per exercise is impractical, think 3+ hrs per take-home exercise. And more importantly, any two teams could have entirely different opinion about the same piece of code&#x2F;architecture. In a limited time setting, candidate can focus on a subset of key aspects like functional spec, clean code, tests, performance, or pixel perfection. But it&#x27;s difficult to gauge what is important to the team.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t want to criticize something without giving a few alternatives.<p>Option 1. LeetCode-style interview is difficult to prepare, but it is more objective and fair when compared with code-a-project styled interview.<p>Option 2. For frontend engineering roles, there are well defined focus areas. Onsite interviews should assess each of these areas separately rather than clubbing them into a single mini-project. Example:<p>Round 1. HTML&#x2F;CSS, tests solid foundational knowledge.\nRound 2. JavaScript, tests solid foundational knowledge.\nRound 3. Framework, pair program a widget.\nRound 4. Special Topics: accessibility, networking, performance, security, testing etc, Pick 1-2 topics and go deep.\nRound 5.

We get about 250rps to our backend systems, which dump this data on a database. We get ~25million records per day, occupying a disk space of ~12.5GB per day (inclusive of elastic index). We use elastic as the backend.<p>We chose elastic because we did not what fields we may get. There are ~40 fields (per record). Some fields may be missing in some records. Coming to the reads, the data thus saved would be queried in a timeseries way. We will access data for last 1 hour, 1 week, 1 month mostly.<p>The data will be queried with a lot of complex aggregations and joins too. For ex: What is the avg response time (which is a field) of all the requests that talked from node (another field) appServer1 to node appServer2, last month.<p>With elastic we are quite happy with the data until there are ~10 million records, beyond which response times just lag. It takes 10+ seconds for each query after 10 million records. We thought it could be due to reader starvation (because of incoming writes) and created a read-only replica and did our queries in that replica. But even there the slowness is felt.<p>In terms of memory, We have given about 1GB for esmaster, 2GB for esdata and another 1GB for esclient. All persistent disks are normal HDDs and not SSDs. We do not have much worries about diskspace and can add more diskspace (but not SSDs). But we will not be able to provision more RAM.<p>Also, we want our system to add columns&#x2F;fields without any stop-the-world migrations. This is what makes me nervous about choosing databases that want a schema ahead.<p>The writes can take (update multiple indexes on each write) but the reads have to be fast. We are also fine with choosing a hybrid approach where one system receives the writes and another system can do the analytics. The system has to work in kubernetes across clouds.

sorry if I&#x27;m wrong but I believe that a significant number of tech companies buy Shutterstock&#x27;s packages or subscriptions</i><p><i>&#x2F;&#x2F; throwaway because I&#x27;m involved with stock image production</i><p>Today Shutterstock announced[1] their new payout levels where they now start to reset authors&#x27; commission rates every year. Level 1 starts at 15% per sale, then it goes to 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, and finally 40% per sale after 25,000 sales which most photographers and illustrators will never achieve in a single year.<p>They are also switching from the $0.25 flat-rate commissions per image bought via subscription packages to a percentage fee that will result in payouts as low as <i>$0.10 per image</i>. And with the aforementioned yearly commission reset, even popular authors are going to receive these miserable royalties during the first months of each year.<p>In other words, total payouts are going to drop for <i>50% or more</i> for the absolute majority of authors (who are usually from low-income countries like Ukraine and Thailand). There is no good reason for this except for Shutterstock being a stagnating rent-seeking company in need of higher quarter earnings. Of course there&#x27;s no way to influence them because the contributors can&#x27;t simply delete their portfolios from the largest stock platform out there, even if it pays peanuts per sale.<p>Most authors upload their content to multiple stocks at once, so please switch to any alternative out there to help them earn more (except for Bigstock because they&#x27;re owned by Shutterstock).<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.shutterstock.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;contributor-earnings-update","time":1590585407,"title":"Tell HN: Shutterstock is changing its commission structure","type":"story"},{"by":"seesawtron","descendants":4,"id":23322661,"kids":[23322860,23322706,23329450,23325359],"score":3,"time":1590585406,"title":"Ask HN: Privacy laws: Can a stranger video record you in public without consent?","type":"story"},{"by":"pseudolus","descendants":94,"id":23322658,"kids":[23322717,23323849,23324208,23325312,23324306,23324988,23330787,23325046],"score":114,"time":1590585375,"title":"France, Italy, Belgium stop hydroxychloroquine use for Covid-19 on safety fears","type":"story","url":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine/france-bans-hydroxychloroquine-to-treat-covid-19-amid-safety-concerns-idUSKBN233197"},{"by":"Cactus2018","descendants":117,"id":23322539,"kids":[23324364,23323075,23323550,23323471,23325308,23323006,23323167,23325988,23323401,23324239,23323859,23322984],"score":104,"time":1590584792,"title":"Variolation","type":"story","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variolation"},{"by":"seesawtron","descendants":3,"id":23322497,"kids":[23330191,23325238,23325265],"score":3,"time":1590584532,"title":"Ask HN: What are Twitter's options to operate if Trump decides to shut it down?","type":"story"},{"by":"heyarviind","descendants":4,"id":23322409,"kids":[23325702,23323099],"score":2,"text":"Hi Awesome Folks,<p>I am working on a logging platform called https:&#x2F;&#x2F;loggie.io<p>While developing I get many questions like do small startups really need this kind of platform?

Android is by far the most popular  mobile operating system in China. Even though Google Play is blocked in China, there are many other ways to get Android apps onto your phone. We hope that this library is used by a wide variety of developers, but in particular we hope that larger organizations, whose websites are blocked in China, consider incorporating this library into their exisiting apps.<p>We have created demo versions of how this code can be integrated into existing apps, so that you can see the library in action and can see that it works.

On Friday evening, I sent an email to you about a new feature called public Triplebyte profiles. We failed to think through the effects of this feature on our community, and made the profiles default public with an option to opt out. Many of you were rightfully angry. I am truly sorry. As CEO, this is my fault. I made this decision. Effective immediately, we are canceling this feature.<p>You came to us with the goal of landing a great software engineering job. As part of that, you entrusted us with your personal, sensitive information, including both the fact that you are job searching as well as the results of your assessments with us. Launching a profile feature that would automatically make any of that data public betrayed that trust.<p>Rather than safeguarding the fact that you are or were job searching, we threatened exposure. Current employers might retaliate if they saw that you were job searching. You did not expect that any personal information you’d given us, in the context of a private, secure job search, would be used publicly without your explicit consent. I sincerely apologize. It was my failure.<p>So, what happened? How did I screw this up? I’ve been asking myself this question a bunch over the past 48 hours. I can point to two factors (which by no means excuse the decision). The first was that the profiles as spec’d were an evolution of a feature we already had (Triplebyte Certificates--these are not default public). I failed to see the significance of “default public” in my head. The second factor was the speed we were trying to move at to respond to the COVID recession. We’re a hiring company and hiring is in crisis. The floor has fallen out on parts of our business, and other parts are under unprecedented growth. We&#x27;ve been in a state of churn as we quickly try various things to adapt. But I let myself get caught in this rush and did not look critically enough at the features we were shipping. Inexcusably, I ignored our users’ very real privacy concerns. This was a breach of trust not only in the decision, but in my actual thought process. The circumstances don’t excuse this. The privacy violation should have been obvious to me from the beginning, and the fact that I did not see this coming was a major failure on my part.<p>Our mission at Triplebyte has always been to build a background-blind hiring process. I graduated at the height of the financial crisis as most companies were doing layoffs (similar to what many recent-grads are experiencing today). My LinkedIn profile and resume had nothing on them other than the name of a school few people had heard of. I applied to over 100 jobs the summer after I graduated, and I remember just never hearing back. I know that a lot of people are going through the same thing right now. I finally got my first job at a company that had a coding challenge rather than a resume screen. They cared about what I could do, not what was on my resume. This was a foundational insight for me. It&#x27;s still the case today, though, that companies rely primarily on resume screens that don’t pick up what most candidates can actually do--making the hiring problem much worse than it needs to be. This is the problem we&#x27;re trying to fix.<p>We believed that we could do so by building a better Linkedin profile that was focused on your skills, rather than where you went to school, where you worked, or who you knew. I still believe there&#x27;s a need for something like this. But to release it as a default public feature was not just a major mistake, it was a betrayal. I&#x27;m ashamed and I&#x27;m sorry.<p>Triplebyte can’t function without the trust of the engineering community. Last Friday I lost a big chunk of that trust. We’re now going to try to earn it back. I’m not sure that’s fully possible, but we have to try. What I will do now is slow down, take a step back, and learn the lessons I need to avoid repeating this.<p>I understand that cancelling this feature does not undo the harm. It’s only one necessary step. Please let me know any other concerns or questions that I can answer (replies to this email go to me). I am sorry to all of you for letting you down.<p>Sincerely,<p>-Ammon","time":1590428094,"title":"Tell HN: Triplebyte reverses, emails apology","type":"story"},{"by":"mmastrac","descendants":2,"id":23303017,"kids":[23309125,23308660],"score":11,"time":1590427960,"title":"Microship.com: The Library of Technomadics","type":"story","url":"https://microship.com/"},{"by":"twillin","descendants":9,"id":23302968,"kids":[23303452,23303289,23302981,23303212],"score":34,"time":1590427483,"title":"TripleByte Public Profiles Response Email","type":"story","url":"https://pastebin.com/pt2pwVvQ"},{"by":"evergre","descendants":3,"id":23302946,"kids":[23312254,23303076],"score":5,"time":1590427322,"title":"Show HN: Protect Your Wealth with Kubera","type":"story","url":"https://kubera.com"},{"by":"daretorant","descendants":2,"id":23302897,"kids":[23303030,23302898],"score":2,"time":1590426955,"title":"Why Bother?","type":"story","url":"https://salman.io/posts/why-bother/"},{"by":"xiwenc","descendants":67,"id":23302871,"kids":[23303393,23303342,23303250,23303909,23305583,23304175,23304511,23305777,23304653,23303594,23304569,23304211,23303820,23305927,23305682,23305027,23307522,23304231,23308508,23303432,23304521],"score":130,"time":1590426767,"title":"Highly available Kubernetes with batteries for small business","type":"story","url":"https://cinaq.com/post/2020/05/25/highly-available-kubernetes-with-batteries-for-small-business/"},{"by":"seleniumbase","descendants":2,"id":23302805,"kids":[23303020,23302980],"score":6,"time":1590426176,"title":"Using Python to load JavaScript packages into any website via browser automation","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/help_docs/js_package_manager.md"},{"by":"jamieweb","descendants":43,"id":23302762,"kids":[23303689,23306847,23303033,23312948,23304202,23303103,23303023,23303325,23303943],"score":116,"time":1590425794,"title":"SONiC – An Open Source Network Operating System","type":"story","url":"https://azure.github.io/SONiC/"},{"by":"adrian_mrd","descendants":155,"id":23302667,"kids":[23303129,23302890,23303260,23303105,23303157,23303556,23302855,23303099,23303259,23303092,23303049,23303280,23309860,23302824,23303547],"score":244,"time":1590425158,"title":"A No. 1 hit vanished from Poland’s charts – it’s not going quietly","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/arts/music/poland-chart-song-removed.html"},{"by":"malgo","descendants":4,"id":23302670,"kids":[23303078,23305192,23302913,23303900],"score":11,"time":1590425187,"title":"The missing query and programming language","type":"story","url":"https://askql.org/press-release.html"},{"by":"huntik17","descendants":60,"id":23302664,"kids":[23303308,23302861,23302917,23303189,23302705,23305730,23302665],"score":66,"time":1590425132,"title":"Updating STM32 Over-The-Air using ESP32","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/laukik-hase/OTA_update_STM32_using_ESP32"},{"by":"alde","descendants":88,"id":23302549,"kids":[23303859,23303153,23302876,23303143,23302852,23304498,23302716,23304919,23305222,23304346,23303852,23302749,23302683,23303560,23305804,23303540,23306195,23306109,23304825],"score":269,"time":1590424142,"title":"Show HN: PgTyped – Typesafe SQL in TypeScript and Postgres","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/adelsz/pgtyped"},{"by":"djsumdog","descendants":9,"id":23302498,"kids":[23303284,23303400,23306157,23303584],"score":11,"time":1590423645,"title":"The harms of exaggerated information and non‐evidence‐based measures","type":"story","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/eci.13222"},{"by":"smacktoward","descendants":3,"id":23302496,"kids":[23309136,23302975,23303043],"score":3,"time":1590423630,"title":"You’re Getting Used to Masks.

Now, you can use your Triplebyte credentials on and off the platform. Just like LinkedIn, your profile will be publicly accessible with a dedicated URL that you can share anywhere (job applications, LinkedIn, GitHub, etc). When you do well on a Triplebyte assessment, your profile will showcase that achievement (we won’t show your scores publicly). Unlike LinkedIn, we aim to become your digital engineering skills resume — a credential based on actual skills, not pedigree.<p>The new profiles will be launching publicly in 1 week. This is a great opportunity to update your profile with your latest experience and preferences. You can edit your profile privacy settings to not appear in public search engines at any time.<p>Our mission is to build an open, valuable, and skills-based credential for all engineers.

Due to the current pandemic, my travels have been paused since March and I don&#x27;t expect them to return to full-form until at least summer 2021 (maybe borders will re-open towards the end of this summer and there&#x27;ll be a short tourist season, but I&#x27;m not counting on crowded backpacker hostels, large cultural sites, or music festivals being the same this year). So, if I can&#x27;t travel the way I like for the next year I figure I might as well get back on the saddle and try to maximize my income for the next 12 months.<p>So my question is: what are the best options as a SWE to make the most money in a year? And what is the expected income in that 1 year? A bit about me: some years as a software engineer at a well-known tech company and an undergrad degree from a top US university.<p>The most obvious answer to me seems to work at a FAANG, particularly Google, known to pay a high salary and without a 1-year cliff plus quarterly or even monthly RSU vesting, with an expected income in the $200-300k range. Start-ups might offer more equity, but I&#x27;m not planning to stick around long enough to make it worth it, and companies that backload their vesting too much (eg: Amazon) are also sub-optimal. Of course this is all assuming I can get the job in the first place, I just want to know what the best options are before I start applying.","time":1590105752,"title":"Ask HN: How to maximize income

Knowledge in both fields can be combined to push the envelope in a new way, that each singly wouldn’t otherwise be able to.<p>This question comes after thinking how I can increase my ‘market value’ now, in case the standard full stack web developer becomes more automated, or some squeeze occurs in the next 5-10 years.<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;wCPbPMRNnvk","time":1590004728,"title":"Ask HN: What field have you combined with C.S.?","type":"story"},{"by":"tosh","descendants":7,"id":23251035,"kids":[23251382,23251573,23252758],"score":51,"time":1590004570,"title":"Event Horizons, Singularities and Other Exotic Spacetime Phenomena","type":"story","url":"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/05/event-horizons-singularities-and-other-exotic-spacetime-phenomena/"},{"by":"jesuisundev","descendants":111,"id":23250979,"kids":[23251386,23251644,23251472,23251276,23251293,23251229,23251845,23251292,23251343,23251357,23259667,23254326,23251476,23251648,23251469,23251677,23253252,23251711,23251946,23251643,23252060,23251233,23251381,23253203,23252570,23251422],"score":66,"time":1590004236,"title":"Why Developers Hate PHP","type":"story","url":"https://www.jesuisundev.com/en/why-developers-hate-php/"},{"by":"DeusExMachina","descendants":3,"id":23250906,"kids":[23253687,23252523,23254438],"score":5,"time":1590003814,"title":"Reddit’s top user says he’s ‘done’ after being outed","type":"story","url":"https://www.dailydot.com/debug/reddit-moderators-quit/"},{"by":"Thevet","descendants":7,"id":23250885,"kids":[23262268,23261782],"score":62,"time":1590003713,"title":"Team reveals genomic history of ancient civilizations in the Andes","type":"story","url":"https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/05/fehrenschmitz-andes.html"},{"by":"danso","descendants":553,"id":23250831,"kids":[23267590,23264065,23261776,23260987,23262161,23260967,23261598,23262655,23261827,23262092,23262582,23262155,23261475,23261854,23262241,23261325,23262114,23261848,23263813,23261483,23261709,23262863,23262632,23262087,23262122,23267634,23261015,23250916,23265430,23262853,23285163,23265724,23264508,23262974,23261632,23263294,23268691,23263332,23268563,23268715,23263524,23273185,23269785,23262533,23263828,23266054,23261940,23263135,23262170,23269518,23267874,23270498,23263912,23262839,23274266,23262528,23266900,23262612],"score":669,"time":1590003393,"title":"Students are failing AP tests because the College Board can’t handle HEIC images","type":"story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21262302/ap-test-fail-iphone-photos-glitch-email-college-board-jpeg-heic"},{"by":"ingve","descendants":23,"id":23250767,"kids":[23251785,23252040,23253128,23251767,23254526,23255936,23254276,23251765,23271250],"score":52,"time":1590003066,"title":"The public do not understand logarithmic graphs used to portray Covid-19","type":"story","url":"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/covid19/2020/05/19/the-public-doesnt-understand-logarithmic-graphs-often-used-to-portray-covid-19/"},{"by":"sachitgupta","descendants":145,"id":23250700,"kids":[23255664,23256210,23254863,23256501,23257931,23255686,23255702,23256423,23255953,23257915,23255115,23254899,23256137,23259260,23258824,23256406,23255698,23258688,23258203,23257684,23259578,23257270,23255883,23255714,23260041],"score":261,"time":1590002743,"title":"Coinbase will be a remote-first company","type":"story","url":"https://blog.coinbase.com/post-covid-19-coinbase-will-be-a-remote-first-company-cdac6e621df7?gi=97cf312cab0b"},{"by":"markus_zhang","descendants":3,"id":23250611,"kids":[23280517,23253265,23252452],"score":10,"text":"Hi trading experts, back in 2012 I did a few months of scraping and momentum trading in a legitimate day-trading shop, as a summer job. I still remember the ECNs e.g. ARCA (I think it was $1.75 per hand back then, way more expensive then the usual $0.50 ones but they offered some rebates).<p>But what fascinated me most was the Dark Pools. They were the most expensive ones, with the cheapest came as $2 per hand, if I remember correctly. But they are very valuable tools if you want to cover position quickly when the market suddenly goes against you.<p>My question is: Fast forward to today. My understanding is that Dark Pools registered with SEC only reports transactions, not buyers&#x2F;sellers, as described in the following article:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;therealdeal.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;18&#x2F;mystery-investor-dumps-big-stake-in-real-estate-fund&#x2F;<p>But so far I couldn&#x27;t find any information on those Dark Pools.

may not be able to articulate my point as clearly as I would like, but knowing the HN community, maybe I can get someone in the comments to do it way better than I ever could.<p>It seems to me that, in the last couple of years, the world has been taking some huge steps back. Not all the problems are new, but some of them have been getting worse or have been made more obvious due to Corona.<p>There are too many to mention, and it would be boring to expand on all of them, but just to name a few:<p>- Climate change. Even with the biggest possible help due to Corona, global emissions haven&#x27;t fallen significantly. The general sentiment I get is that most people are not willing to give up anything from our modern lifestyles in the West, so I get this sinking feeling that we are headed straight for the cliff and, instead of slamming the breaks, we are accelerating. Moreover, it looks like climate change denial is still a thing.<p>- Inequality<p>- Growing nationalism &amp; growing anti-EU sentiment. This is especially happening in Europe - see Hungary, Poland, UK, but it&#x27;s more or less across the board.<p>- Trump. The upcoming election will be between Trump and Biden. This makes me terribly sad.<p>- Mass surveillance<p>- Growing division among generations, countries, ethnicities.<p>- Conspiracy theories seem to be on the rise<p>- We are addicted to smartphones, Facebook and Instagram<p>There are also countries where democracy is going downhill - just look at Turkey, Russia, Hong Kong, Brazil, China.

I&#x27;m Andrew, one of the makers of Satchel. (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;satchel.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;satchel.com</a>). We write SaaS buying guides. We vigorously test products in different SaaS categories, write reports about our findings, and then try to identify the best product for a typical early-stage startup. Along the way, we uncover and share info that should be obvious (but isn&#x27;t), and point out any caveats and pitfalls you might encounter.<p>We&#x27;re like The Wirecutter &#x2F; Consumer Reports for SaaS, minus the affiliate links &#x2F; paywall (more on this later).<p>There&#x27;s a real information problem in B2B software. Without prior experience, it&#x27;s hard to know how to evaluate a product, figure out what differentiates it, learn all relevant background, and compare against alternatives. Many times, it&#x27;s difficult even to decipher what exactly a product does. As a buyer, you&#x27;re often in the position of having to make a high-quality decision on something you&#x27;re far from being an expert on. If you&#x27;re anything like me, you often don&#x27;t even know what you don&#x27;t know.<p>There are plenty of crowd-sourced review sites out there, but they usually all end up filled with 5-star reviews that boil down to &quot;I used <i>X</i> [and only <i>X</i>] and it was good.&quot; There is also an abundance of startup tool lists and directories, yet the problem is less about seeing what tools are out there and more about figuring out which one to use.<p>We&#x27;re taking a different path, one that others have tended to avoid. We do hands-on testing and write in-depth long-form for each category of tools (with plenty of summaries to make it useful even when skimming), which can&#x27;t be replaced with code (even though we, as engineers, sincerely wish that weren&#x27;t the case). We&#x27;re not reliant on vendors, so we can say what we actually think about a product, both upsides and downsides, instead of being pressured to normalize everything we say around &quot;pretty good.&quot;<p>I see us as fundamentally helping you do something akin to time&#x2F;information arbitrage. If lots of startups are each spending, say, ten hours doing the exact same research and testing, why doesn&#x27;t someone spend 100 hours doing that research and then freely distribute the results? Everyone would save time yet get higher quality information.<p>Right now, we have three longform guides geared towards startups just starting out: store of money (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;satchel.com&#x2F;store-of-money\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;satchel.com&#x2F;store-of-money</a>), incorporation service (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;satchel.com&#x2F;incorporation\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;satchel.com&#x2F;incorporation</a>), and web analytics (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;satchel.com&#x2F;web-analytics\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;satchel.com&#x2F;web-analytics</a>). We have preliminary results (but not full writeups) for a lot more categories at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;satchel.com&#x2F;handbook\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;satchel.com&#x2F;handbook</a>.<p>We don&#x27;t expect to support ourselves financially in the same way as The Wirecutter (affiliate program) or Consumer Reports (paywall). Affiliate programs are mostly conflict-of-interest-free when rates are standardized across products (e.g. via Amazon for consumer goods), but are a lot harder to execute properly in a fragmented market like B2B software&#x27;s. I&#x27;m also personally opposed to paywalling our work (I spent a lot of my formative years as a bio researcher, and I&#x27;d sincerely claim that open-access was a saving grace). Instead, we think there are ways we can increase the efficiency of the SaaS procurement&#x2F;purchasing process, and intend to monetize there based on value-add.<p>We would love to hear your feedback and your experiences with B2B software. I&#x27;m personally excited to be sharing this with HN, and I&#x27;ll be here to answer any and all questions you want to throw my way!","time":1589903968,"title":"Launch HN: Satchel (YC S18) – Guides

The product&#x2F;service is subscription-based SaaS -- we have hopes of charging $10k-$20k per year. (We&#x27;ve validated this price-range). We&#x27;ve not taken any funding from anyone, but both have savings to last for a while.<p>We have been working with company X to develop our beta. So far, it has been very productive, but no money has exchanged hands and only NDA&#x27;s have been signed. There was a handshake-level agreement that our product would be tailor made to their exact situation, and they&#x27;d be our first customer.<p>Now that we&#x27;re closing in on an initial beta release, company X suggests out of the blue that, in order for us to keep working together, they&#x27;d want a piece of our company. (No specifics yet, but we&#x27;re expecting the discussion to be 5-10 points). The equity would be vesting over a few years, and would have no &#x27;privileges&#x27; like voting&#x2F;etc (only value will be at exit). In exchange, they&#x27;d continue working with us to develop our core product, be our first paying customers, and also work as our sales team. And, in their, words, &quot;align our interests&quot;.<p>The last part, helping us sell, is compelling to us because we don&#x27;t have many connections in the industry, whereas the company is multifaceted and deals with many of our potential customers.<p>The crux of the matter is: if we do go through with such an arrangement, how do we structure such a contract? Company X has assured us that if they don&#x27;t meet certain &#x27;benchmarks&#x27;, they&#x27;d return our shares. What would these benchmarks look like? For example, is it appropriate to ask that they help us sell to, say, X leads per year? agree to commit to purchase Y licenses per year directly? Help us launch ancillary services? Provide us with access to certain sensitive data?<p>And, in exchange, what do we offer them, besides developing the services to their needs?<p>Sorry for rambling on, but all of this is new to us and

Could not find anything more recent; but what they mention in these articles - even the ones that are adopting lisp talk about issues like:<p>* poor ecosystem of libraries - few gems, most other half-baked<p>* poor community coordination<p>* Dependency management limitations with quicklisp<p>And some specific red flags like:<p>* poor support for json[6]\n* poor support for async<p>* have to restart the server every 20 days because of some memory leak [3]<p>* hack to tune GC [5]<p>If you are using lisp in production for non-trivial cases, \ndo these issues still exist? is there a way you can quantify effort is resolving them, and if yes, what is it?\nand, finally, if you had to re-do your project, would you chose lisp or something else?<p>[1]: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gigamonkeys.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gigamonkeys.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leanpub.com&#x2F;lovinglisp&#x2F;read#quicklisp\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leanpub.com&#x2F;lovinglisp&#x2F;read#quicklisp</a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lisp-journey.gitlab.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;why-turtl-switched-from-lisp-to-js&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lisp-journey.gitlab.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;why-turtl-switched-from-...</a><p>[4]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lisp-journey.gitlab.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;why-deftask-chose-common-lisp&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lisp-journey.gitlab.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;why-deftask-chose-common...</a><p>[5]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.grammarly.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;engineering&#x2F;running-lisp-in-production&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.grammarly.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;engineering&#x2F;running-lisp-in-p...</a><p>[6]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stevelosh.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2018&#x2F;08&#x2F;a-road-to-common-lisp&#x2F;#s48-st-json\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stevelosh.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2018&#x2F;08&#x2F;a-road-to-common-lisp&#x2F;#s4...</a>","time":1589868035,"title":"Ask HN: Production Lisp in 2020?","type":"story"},{"by":"velmu","descendants":8,"id":23231517,"kids":[23232435,23231596,23231919,23231839],"score":35,"time":1589865887,"title":"Wikipedia Is Now Banned in China in All Languages (2019)","type":"story","url":"https://time.com/5589439/china-wikipedia-online-censorship/"},{"by":"enonevets","descendants":2,"id":23231534,"kids":[23232693,23240809],"score":10,"time":1589866077,"title":"Raspberry Pi Operating System Looks Like OS X","type":"story","url":"https://boingboing.net/2020/05/18/raspberry-pi-operating-system.html/"},{"by":"anarbadalov","descendants":32,"id":23231510,"kids":[23250452,23249585,23252413,23249072,23249868,23253612,23253748,23253587,23249126,23254584,23249316,23249501,23250528,23250316,23251609,23249259,23251218],"score":82,"time":1589865819,"title":"The Rise and Fall of Polywater","type":"story","url":"https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/the-rise-and-fall-of-polywater"},{"by":"bollu","descendants":122,"id":23231361,"kids":[23232766,23231571,23232834,23235568,23233071,23235184,23231698,23237813,23233569,23233660,23232958,23235974,23235106,23234836,23232702,23234732,23239818,23245668,23233993,23232630,23238524,23232791,23236836,23233181,23235204],"score":417,"time":1589863863,"title":"The unreasonable effectiveness of declarative programming","type":"story","url":"https://bollu.github.io/mathemagic/declarative/index.html"},{"by":"behnamoh","descendants":70,"id":23231254,"kids":[23231439,23231537,23231414,23231546,23231423,23231658,23231631,23257380,23231428,23231467,23231455,23231399,23274217,23231641,23231465,23232020,23231420,23234858,23233087,23234757,23231890,23231466,23233866,23233238,23232530,23231378,23231764,23231393,23231390,23231473,23231770,23231409,23256407,23232656,23233758],"score":43,"text":"Some MVNOs are offering plans as low as $6&#x2F;mo.

Our 1st was a PhD project turned into a startup which simulated public cloud costs before adoption - an example use-case was Disney trying to figure out how much it would cost to render their new movie on AWS and Google, using different configs, RIs vs on-demand, different services. That was PlanForCloud and was acquired by RightScale.<p>Our 2nd startup was even more interesting - we built a public Container-as-a-Service cloud, but in a place where Amazon&#x2F;Google could not enter - Iran! This grew fast, and was acquired by the Uber of Iran - the world&#x27;s 5th largest ride hailing app by rides. That was AbarCloud and was acquired by Snapp. If anyone is interested in how you design a public cloud with minimal external dependencies, and continues to function when the underlying internet connections to outside of the country are cut, ask in the questions :)<p>Back to our current idea. When scaling AbarCloud, we needed to hire DevOps &amp; SREs. When hiring developers, to assess their skillsets, we’d use something like HackerRank or Codility. But when hiring DevOps and SREs, where troubleshooting, scaling and failover etc, are important, these assessment tools don’t help.<p>CircuitOps spins up live environments with broken things in it, drops the candidate in, and asks them to troubleshoot, diagnose and fix the issues. All their working is recorded, and (future feature) auto-marked. Try it here: www.CircuitOps.com<p>I’d love your feedback, specifically about:\n1 - What is the hardest part of hiring? For anyone who has stopped hiring due to Covid-19, has this impacted DevOps&#x2F;SRE roles?<p>2 - What do you think about this style of testing candidates by doing real life scenarios? Have you done a DIY approach to this at all?<p>3 - If you are a hiring manager, would you use this tool during a live interview, or as a pre-interview filter? How else would you use this tool?<p>Cheers from Scotland,\nHassan, Ali &amp; Alistair","time":1589821809,"title":"Show HN: Hiring DevOps and SREs – testing troubleshooting live","type":"story"},{"by":"spudlyo","descendants":221,"id":23225147,"kids":[23227113,23228757,23228319,23225495,23225587,23226408,23225881,23225870,23227938,23228276,23229964,23226045,23227128,23228686,23225791,23231766,23226074,23226696,23228116,23227779,23229024,23228387,23226520,23227755,23226992],"score":296,"time":1589821587,"title":"The Unicorns Fell into a Ditch","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-05-18/the-unicorns-fell-into-a-ditch"},{"by":"generalpass","descendants":5,"id":23225138,"kids":[23227847,23238659],"score":34,"time":1589821558,"title":"US Supreme Court upholds state power to enforce compulsory vaccination (1905)","type":"story","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobson_v._Massachusetts"},{"by":"fourthark","descendants":8,"id":23225026,"kids":[23225068,23229505,23227556],"score":12,"time":1589821170,"title":"US lockdown protests may have spread virus widely, cellphone data suggests","type":"story","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/lockdown-protests-spread-coronavirus-cellphone-data"},{"by":"melvinroest","descendants":56,"id":23225072,"kids":[23225407,23233697,23234395,23232816,23235805,23233639,23233528,23232948,23234008,23234140,23234333,23233854,23236137,23238056,23235150,23233924,23234888,23233938,23233759,23241477,23235498,23233877,23234200,23245533,23234059,23241646,23233871],"score":41,"text":"Hi HN!<p>I have a question.<p>One of Julia Evan&#x27;s posts give amazing tips like maintaining a brag document. It&#x27;s a log of every workday with a short description of what you have done that day [1]. When your performance review comes around, you can remember exactly what you did! There was a more debated, but in my mind interesting, post about a career cold start algorithm [2].<p>I am wondering, are there other tips that I should think about when one just joined a startup and had their first day?<p>I created a reflection document. I state what I did, what I thought went well and what could go better as I think it&#x27;s more effective than a brag document as it helps with more processes (your own reflection, retrospectives and performance review). I also read the whole discussion on the career cold start and made my own variant of it. I call it: meet everyone one on one and get to know them.<p>One nuance: the place where I started, Triply [3], is seemingly not a pure startup. IMO, it is transforming to a scale-up, as they are looking for developers.<p>It made me realize that the tips might differ on the startup, scale-up and corporate level. So I wonder if people think whether there are certain tips that pertain only to a certain company size. Or how do things differ from US vs EU vs Asia vs &lt;categories I forget&gt;?<p>Second nuance: I know it&#x27;s tough for some during the corona lockdown. It&#x27;s one of the reasons why I mention that they are hiring.

Calling it community self-regulation does not change the fact, that in case with controversial topics a single person can make it so, that a submission never reaches the front page or, if a submission is, in fact, interesting for some users and thus upvoted to the front page, disappears (rather shortly) after the conversation has already begun, and the majority of users never get the chance to see it and participate in the discussion, even if it could be interesting to some of them as well.<p>I totally understand, how this can help to mitigate submission of illicit content and how this relieves moderators from a lot of work by outsourcing moderation to users.<p>Having said that, my concern is that:<p>1) There are a lot of users with high enough karma. This makes the probability, that someone will be pissed&#x2F;upset by a certain topic, unacceptably high.<p>2) I&#x27;d even argue, that it&#x27;s pretty easy to get a high enough karma just by doing regular submissions. E.g. if you submit a couple of links daily over a sufficiently long period of time, there&#x27;s a good probability that a couple of submissions turn out to be popular.<p>Does the fact, that you make regular submissions, entitle you to moderation of discussions started by other people? I don&#x27;t think so.<p>Also, there&#x27;s a &quot;conspiracy&quot; side to this. What prevents an adversary, who is indeed interested in targeted censorship (as opposed to genuinely pissed&#x2F;upset users), from using this tactic to create a user account with high karma? It&#x27;s important to say that, as I imagine, such an adversary is able to plan strategically and act in advance, so they would already have created such accounts by this moment. I.e. there may already exist users, that are either completely fake or affiliated with adversaries.","time":1589816946,"title":"Ask HN: Self-Censorship on Hacker

You can also filter the types of events and if they are free or paid events.<p>Thanks to this app, you will never be bored tonight. You have a ranking of the best movies in all online movie platforms, which will allow you to enjoy this confinement and is one of the main sources of things to do in your free time.<p>Note: We don’t play movies in this app. This app allows you to browse movies in your favorite platform, some of the movies are free, some not, the owners of those platforms are the ones who own the rights of the movies.&quot;<p>17 May 2020, Google suspended my app for using keywords related to COVID-19.<p>This is my case, but in a near future, how I can advertise my users or future users that my app behaviour is different due to COVID, I have no chance. 8 months developing that lead to a suspension for using covid words, at least, It&#x27;s not 9 years like the Podcast Addict app.","time":1589804786,"title":"Google bans my events app for referencing Covid-19, or related terms","type":"story"},{"by":"mrfusion","descendants":1,"id":23221456,"kids":[23222701,23222051,23221989],"score":5,"time":1589804859,"title":"Risk of coronavirus spreading in schools is 'extremely low' study finds","type":"story","url":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/risk-coronavirus-spreading-schools-extremely-194143983.html"},{"by":"buboard","descendants":2,"id":23221333,"kids":[23221516,23234805],"score":7,"time":1589804012,"title":"Moderna Announces Positive Interim Phase 1 Data for Its mRNA Vaccine Against C19","type":"story","url":"https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-positive-interim-phase-1-data-its-mrna-vaccine"},{"by":"marinosbern","descendants":13,"id":23221271,"kids":[23222030,23221922,23221956,23224148,23228001,23224477,23233001],"score":71,"time":1589803481,"title":"Forensic Investigation – The Shocking State of Privacy in Safety Apps","type":"story","url":"https://parachute.live/blog/forensic-investigation-the-shocking-state-of-privacy-in-safety-apps"},{"by":"alfiedotwtf","descendants":108,"id":23221264,"kids":[23221487,23221326,23221495,23221342,23221393,23221718,23221396,23221930,23221821,23221501,23222999,23221673,23224021,23224154,23221376,23225419,23222763,23221332,23221882,23221355,23233549,23221334,23221622,23222902,23221477],"score":324,"text":"I was just alerted to YouTube censoring comments critical of China.

Unfortunately, phones like that that are available today either are a) too old and use outdated networks, b) new but seem like they have awfulness engineered into the UI as a feature to push people towards smartphones. None of them seem even remotely hackable, because they&#x27;re all proprietary. The new open phone OSes (like pinephone) are encouraging, but everything still seems to be pretty firmly entrenched in the smartphone paradigm, and don&#x27;t run on semi-dumb phones.<p>I&#x27;ve hacked a bit on arduinos and raspberry pis, so I could figure out how to wire up a pi with a 4G modem with a battery and a screen.

When I check my current skills, future goals, and job descriptions, the list of stuff I must learn is extremely long. AWS, advanced stuff in Go, distributed system theory, databases, queue systems, Istio, other fancy CNCF tools,  networking in Linux, k8s controller patterns, oncall stuff, gRPC, authentication&#x2F;authorization mechanisms, managing a REST API, scaling something with zero downtime, observability etc. I am already using some of these tools&#x2F;techniques in my full-time job but it is impossible to experience all of them in a position. On the other hand, as far as I see, I am supposed to know many of them.<p>I am aware that my choices are going to deeply affect my path&#x2F;opportunities in the future. For example, k8s controllers are a very niche field whereas being a skillful Go developer comes with more and more opportunities.

With 20K€ in savings.<p>I feel like I&#x27;m in paused state in life where I&#x27;m almost 30, I can&#x27;t afford a car, I can&#x27;t afford to buy a house and I feel like everyone around me is telling me I should get paid more but I&#x27;m not seeing anything in the market.<p>I have ALWAYS gotten stellar performance reviews, however last year my manager got me a ~2% raise.<p>I feel stuck, without options, and far from financial stability. Any and all feedback, opinion and help is much appreciated.<p>throwaway account for obvious reasons.","time":1589712714,"title":"Ask HN: How can I get paid more?","type":"story"},{"by":"sobermanman","descendants":19,"id":23211101,"kids":[23224218,23211102,23224497,23224310,23225212,23224344,23223954,23272823],"score":72,"time":1589712634,"title":"Unpacking HP Firmware Updates","type":"story","url":"https://jsof-tech.com/unpacking-hp-firmware-updates-part-1/"},{"by":"jayp1418","descendants":34,"id":23211301,"kids":[23211612,23214009,23211633,23212561,23217306,23214308,23213621,23212113],"score":43,"time":1589715754,"title":"Entropy and the NetBSD Kernel","type":"story","url":"https://washbear.neocities.org/entropy.html"},{"by":"luu","descendants":352,"id":23211068,"kids":[23226839,23227465,23228954,23226309,23231006,23226857,23232521,23231337,23228063,23228807,23228998,23227204,23226503,23226409,23228969,23226042,23226401,23232639,23226305,23228047,23227339,23227891,23226338,23228261,23229712,23226362,23233752,23226780,23225855,23229602,23233409,23226562,23231545,23234476,23229470,23229741,23229090,23230162,23230057,23232687,23230772,23231241,23232260,23231091,23231302,23227943,23226350,23226483,23227903,23229477,23231446,23233651,23228124,23227592,23228947,23226875,23230099,23228690,23229166,23231458,23230581,23229145,23227921,23230918,23230987,23232181,23227315,23228264,23226705,23233895,23227729],"score":407,"time":1589712077,"title":"The effects on cognition of sleeping 4 hours per night for 12-14 days","type":"story","url":"https://guzey.com/science/sleep/14-day-sleep-deprivation-self-experiment/"},{"by":"caution","descendants":74,"id":23211095,"kids":[23211360,23211297,23211285,23214783,23211889,23216330,23214173,23213338,23213542,23212438,23214816,23211338,23212622,23211350,23214095,23211251],"score":123,"time":1589712559,"title":"Facebook's ‘oversight board’ is proof that it wants to be regulated by itself","type":"story","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/16/facebooks-oversight-board-is-proof-that-it-wants-to-be-regulated-by-itself"},{"by":"geclos","descendants":2,"id":23211090,"kids":[23235582,23211091],"score":1,"time":1589712431,"title":"What I’ve been reading #1","type":"story","url":"https://gerardclos.com/what_i_have_been_reading_1/"},{"by":"econcon","descendants":1,"id":23211027,"kids":[23211424,23211399],"score":2,"text":"What it means for the layman?

It seems that most of the time, the simplest explanation is also the true one, but that does not stop us from adding unverified assumptions and exit with very personal but complex conclusions.<p>* when interacting with people always look for the signal, because from the words alone in the message can be very misrepresented. Use the message to transform the signal into something simple as in: i don&#x27;t know, maybe, yes, no, i don&#x27;t like that etc - obviously this should not apply when you get specific data on topics where details are important<p>* context - in my opinion this is also underrated because most of the time the conclusions are not enough or can be easily dismissed. I always like to give as an example &quot;flat earthers&quot;.

It can come off as not relevant but it can be applied also in verbal communication.<p>If you think of success as getting what you want, having a better understanding of how individuals communicate and being better at communicating with them, can give you a boost in navigating towards what you want.","time":1589644490,"title":"Ask HN: What are the skills you use to navigate the world?","type":"story"},{"by":"jtbayly","descendants":186,"id":23204410,"kids":[23208362,23206672,23208033,23210600,23207144,23206749,23207782,23206777,23209585,23209807,23206604,23208517,23208290,23207109,23208524,23208239,23206717,23210633,23210489],"score":157,"time":1589644320,"title":"Nearly 40% of Icelanders are using a Covid app, but it hasn’t helped much","type":"story","url":"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/11/1001541/iceland-rakning-c19-covid-contact-tracing/"},{"by":"andriosr","descendants":83,"id":23204358,"kids":[23204827,23204754,23204785,23204891,23204887,23205146,23205637,23204896,23204673,23204852,23205029,23205410,23205300,23205667,23205551,23205103,23204842,23205241,23205371,23205024,23205800,23205659,23206667,23205345,23205279,23204966,23205004,23205047,23205303,23207521,23204811,23205746,23204895,23206754,23207997,23205744,23205141],"score":52,"text":"I&#x27;ve been thinking about things I have to do regularly, but are not worth the time.<p>Examples for me:<p>- manual tasks I didn&#x27;t have time do automate yet (technical debt)\n- writing boilerplate code\n- unproductive meetings to discuss things that would be 1000x more efficient over text&#x2F;a document<p>These are things I do regularly and they don&#x27;t make me learn or improve at the rate of more interesting stuff.<p>Are these the same for you?<p>What are you doing that you wish you weren&#x27;t?","time":1589644010,"title":"Ask HN: What's the biggest time waste on your workday?","type":"story"},{"by":"0x142857","descendants":16,"id":23204342,"kids":[23206003,23206653,23206789,23207598,23207866,23205927],"score":53,"time":1589643920,"title":"Show HN: Docup – single-page documentation for your open source projects","type":"story","url":"https://docup.now.sh/"},{"by":"a_alakkad","descendants":16,"id":23204314,"kids":[23212670,23210122,23216015,23228087,23214357,23208972,23220630,23208293,23226853,23210901,23221713,23209452,23204951],"score":16,"text":"If one is planning for long term health, let&#x27;s say after 20-30 years, what is the needed amount of exercise that should be done on a regular basis?","time":1589643713,"title":"Ask HN: What's the minimum exercise one should do in 30s to stay healthy by 70s?","type":"story"},{"by":"aloukissas","descendants":275,"id":23204225,"kids":[23204518,23204680,23204473,23204348,23204595,23204475,23204500,23204384,23204660,23204315,23205446,23204311,23204497,23204888,23204655,23204492,23207514,23204726,23204647,23204689,23208710,23204599,23204336,23204435,23205136,23207555,23204832,23204568,23205480,23204911,23204658,23204672,23204937,23205005,23204548,23204511,23204844,23204324,23205348,23215534,23206112,23207944,23204919,23204816,23204669,23204504,23217239,23204387,23204349,23204405,23204949,23204381,23204545],"score":164,"time":1589643192,"title":"Our restaurants are failing.

Does Jekyll (or Hugo) come close?<p>- Are Gatsby &#x2F; Next JS really for static website, or for mostly static websites with a sprinkling of dynamic elements (eg. e-commerce, travel booking, etc), that people unnecessarily wrote in React, and ended-up creating a problem where none existed?<p>- What is truly the sweet spot for this kind of technology?

still employed during this brutal situation, but have had plenty of time for self-reflection and reflection in general.<p>It consumes quite a bit of my thinking recently, trying to find new ways of unwinding what&#x27;s happening in US politics, and some things have started to become less opaque to me as I try to reason about this.<p>One thing that struck me recently, which I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever heard anyone talk about is the following.<p>I&#x27;ve recently started following some threads on a few &quot;trending topics&quot; on Twitter, and digging a little deeper into, and even conversing with, some of the people writing flaming Tweets on these threads.  I can&#x27;t say the &quot;research&quot; has been extensive, but I&#x27;ve noticed quite a few &quot;right wing&quot; replies tend to be from accounts flagged as &quot;problematic&quot; or &quot;alarming&quot; on the &quot;Trollbot scale&quot;, but strangely enough in some of the cases I&#x27;ve gotten responses from these people, which made me recognize that it&#x27;s likely some of these accounts are being flagged for BEHAVIOR and not for being an actual BOT.<p>It would seem, to the casual observer, that perhaps this categorization is biased toward the &quot;liberal elite&quot;.  But then it sort of struck me...<p>If you try to imagine the daily working lives of blue-collar Americans.

My situation is a little unusual so I&#x27;ll just explain. Many years ago I got a master&#x27;s degree in mathematics from a U.S. university, so I have a solid, if rusty, background in mathematics. Since then among other things I&#x27;ve worked as a generalist programmer at smaller companies.<p>A math background has been more of a curiosity than an actual asset at these jobs. However, I&#x27;m getting older and starting to appreciate the importance of domain expertise instead of just being able to write code. I&#x27;d like to build on my math background, and I&#x27;d also plain just like to get back into it, reading textbooks, sketching solutions, all of that. It&#x27;s fun. Programming is fun, too.<p>So my question is whether it&#x27;s realistic to expect that putting effort into (re)learning advanced math will translate into a job where that knowledge matters. For example a while ago I bought Bishop&#x27;s machine learning textbook. I bogged down in the second chapter or so. I know if I really focused, I could get through it. But would anyone care? Obviously not as a resume line item, which would be ridiculous, but having the knowledge.<p>I&#x27;m currently comfortably unemployed and can focus on this or whatever I want for a while, but I&#x27;ll need to work again eventually. Is there a way to self-study, with my existing background, into a job that&#x27;s part advanced math and part programming, or would it all be just a hobby unless I go back for a PhD?<p>Thanks!","time":1589387680,"title":"Ask HN: Can refreshing my advanced math background turn into a related job?","type":"story"},{"by":"sfpwork","descendants":5,"id":23168932,"kids":[23170290,23170706],"score":12,"text":"With more organizations likely moving to permanent WFH arrangements, more abundant office real estate, and the risks of cramming too many people in a small space for several hours per day, will we see a return of the individual offices?

When checking out the Rust frontend dev landscape, I found that basically all relevant libraries&#x2F;frameworks are React-like:<p>- components that receive props and pass props to their children<p>- state updates triggered by async messages like in Redux<p>- some JSX-like syntax<p>Since I&#x27;m already familiar with React&#x2F;Redux, this works out well for me. But I couldn&#x27;t help but notice the monoculture. I suppose some of this is due to the unidirectional data flow model being a good match to Rust&#x27;s ownership system.<p>My question is if this monoculture, as well as the general buzz around React (and similar frameworks like Vue or Svelte) is just a fad, or if we&#x27;re all really taking a genuine step forward in understanding how best to structure GUI code.<p>From my POV, React is a genuine step forward compared to the jQuery-based apps from 10 years ago that were a hot mess of disjointed updates. But I&#x27;d like to hear some perspectives from others, esp. those of you who have worked with GUI frameworks on other platforms over the years. I have a few years of Qt under my belt, but I&#x27;m undecided on whether the differences between Qt and React&#x2F;etc. are significant or just an artifact of the different programming paradigms encouraged by their respective languages.","time":1589234427,"title":"Ask HN: Are React-like UI frameworks a fad or a genuine step forward?","type":"story"},{"by":"rfreytag","descendants":3,"id":23147528,"kids":[23159430,23161983,23163319],"score":17,"time":1589233883,"title":"What to Consider Before Embarking on a Rewrite","type":"story","url":"https://www.mcls.io/blog/before-embarking-on-a-rewrite"},{"by":"kkcorps","descendants":8,"id":23147451,"kids":[23148114,23147643,23147796],"score":21,"time":1589233395,"title":"Elon Musk defies stay-home order to reopen Tesla and asks to be arrested","type":"story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/11/21255149/elon-musk-tesla-fremont-factory-reopen-order-arrest-alameda"},{"by":"caution","descendants":61,"id":23147426,"kids":[23147901,23147739,23148593,23148397,23149384,23149352],"score":74,"time":1589233246,"title":"New – M6g EC2 Instances, Powered by AWS Graviton2","type":"story","url":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-m6g-ec2-instances-powered-by-arm-based-aws-graviton2/"},{"by":"etaioinshrdlu","descendants":73,"id":23147392,"kids":[23147806,23152369,23151979,23147889,23150976,23149370,23150146,23149837,23149051,23150001,23152442,23151062,23151088,23149886,23148595,23151201,23149248,23147853,23153864,23147649,23152752,23150682],"score":211,"time":1589233010,"title":"Artbreeder – Extend Your Imagination with GANs","type":"story","url":"https://artbreeder.com/"},{"by":"termau","descendants":107,"id":23147372,"kids":[23148269,23148026,23151658,23147641,23148206,23149040,23150671,23148153,23149527,23151525,23150548,23149392,23152605,23151122,23153647,23147685,23147828,23148448,23148092,23149174,23149667,23150465,23148094,23147575,23149538,23147542,23149729,23152690,23152738,23149959,23150345,23153266,23147915,23147634,23148580],"score":231,"time":1589232912,"title":"John Peel Sessions","type":"story","url":"https://davestrickson.blogspot.com/2020/05/john-peel-sessions.html"},{"by":"sytse","descendants":6,"id":23147304,"kids":[23147408,23148769],"score":14,"time":1589232498,"title":"Jeffrey Katzenberg Blames Pandemic for Quibi’s Rough Start","type":"story","url":"http://archive.vn/17Ndj"},{"by":"flyinglizard","descendants":113,"id":23147170,"kids":[23150092,23147946,23150497,23147890,23149977,23151301,23152065,23148779,23147800],"score":164,"time":1589231780,"title":"KH-11 spysat design revealed by NRO’s telescope gift to NASA (2012)","type":"story","url":"https://www.americaspace.com/2012/06/06/top-secret-kh-11-spysat-design-revealed-by-nros-twin-telescope-gift-to-nasa/"},{"by":"A4ET8a8uTh0","descendants":8,"id":23146987,"kids":[23147935,23147616],"score":8,"time":1589230604,"title":"Musk dares Alameda county to arrest him","type":"story","url":"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/musk-vows-to-reopen-california-factory-2020-05-11?mod=mw_latestnews"},{"by":"senidesantjagi","descendants":8,"id":23146929,"kids":[23162691,23147179,23146963],"score":13,"text":"I started a company in 2019.

In a few lines of code, data scientists and engineers can explore data, train machine learning models, and build batch or streaming pipelines over very large datasets (size ranging from 10GBs to PBs).<p>While writing Spark applications is pretty easy, managing their infrastructure, deploying them and keeping them performant and stable in production over time is hard. You need to learn how Apache Spark works under the hood, become an expert with YARN and the JVM, manually choose dozens of infrastructure parameters and Spark configurations, and go through painfully slow iteration cycles to develop, debug, and productionize your app.<p>As you can tell, before starting Data Mechanics, we were frustrated Spark developers. Julien was a data scientist and data engineer at BlaBlaCar and ContentSquare. JY was the Spark infrastructure team lead at Databricks, the data science platform founded by the creators of Spark. We’ve designed Data Mechanics so that our peer data scientists and engineers can focus on their core mission - building models and pipelines - while the platform handles the mechanical DevOps work.<p>To realize this goal, we needed a way to tune infrastructure parameters and Spark configurations automatically. There are dozens of such parameters but the most critical ones are the amount of memory and cpu allocated to each node, the degree of parallelism of Spark, and the way Spark handles all-to-all data transfer stages (called shuffles). It takes a lot of expertise and trial-and-error loops to manually tune those parameters. To do it automatically, we first run the logs and metadata produced by Spark through a set of heuristics that determines if the application is stable and performant. A Bayesian optimization algorithm uses this analysis as well as data from past recent runs to choose a set of parameters to use on the next run. It’s not perfect - it needs a few iterations like an engineer would. But the impact is huge because this happens automatically for each application running on the platform (which would be too time-consuming for an engineer). Take the example of an application gradually going unstable as the input data grows over time. Without us, the application crashes on a random day, and an engineer must spend a day remediating the impact of the outage and debugging the app. Our platform can often anticipate and avoid the outage altogether.<p>The other way we differentiate is by integrating with the popular tools from the data stack. Enterprise data science platforms tend to require their users to abandon their tools to adopt their own end-to-end suite of proprietary solutions: their hosted notebooks, their scheduler, their way of packaging dependencies and version-controlling your code. Instead, our users can connect their Jupyter notebook, their Airflow scheduler, and their favourite IDE directly to the platform. This enables a seamless transition from local development to running at scale on the platform.<p>We also deploy Spark directly on Kubernetes, which wasn’t possible until recently (Spark version 2.3) - most Spark platforms run on YARN instead. This means our users can package their code dependencies on a Docker image and use a lot of k8s-compatible projects for free (for example around secrets management and monitoring). Kubernetes does have its inherent complexity. We hide it from our users by deploying Data Mechanics in their cloud account on a Kubernetes cluster that we manage for them. Our users can simply interact with our web UI and our API&#x2F;CLI - they don’t need to poke around Kubernetes unless they really want to.<p>The platform is available on AWS, GCP, and Azure. Many of our customers use us for their ETL pipelines, they appreciate the ease of use of the platform and the performance boost from automated tuning. We’ve also helped companies start their first Spark project: a startup is using us to parallelize chemistry computations and accelerate the discovery of drugs. This is our ultimate goal - to make distributed data processing accessible to all.<p>Of course, we share this mission with many companies out there, but we hope you’ll find our angle interesting! We’re excited to share our story with the HN community today and we look forward to hearing about your experience in the data engineering and data science spaces. Have you used Spark and did you feel the frustrations we talked about? If you consider Spark for your next project, does our platform look appealing? We don’t offer self-service deployment yet, but you can schedule a demo with us from the website and we’ll be happy to give you a free trial access in exchange for your feedback.<p>Thank you!","time":1589209117,"title":"Launch HN: Data Mechanics (YC S19) – The Simplest Way to Run Apache Spark","type":"story"},{"by":"boredgamer2","descendants":49,"id":23142756,"kids":[23147470,23147945,23147743,23150274,23148976,23149586,23147404,23147876,23147813,23151026,23147857,23147774,23147300,23148622],"score":71,"time":1589208729,"title":"PwdHash (2009)","type":"story","url":"https://crypto.stanford.edu/PwdHash/"},{"by":"jeand","descendants":1,"id":23142686,"kids":[23142866,23142727,23143454],"score":2,"time":1589208375,"title":"China’s Spaceplane Projects: A Mapping of Past, Present and Future Programs","type":"story","url":"https://china-aerospace.blog/2020/05/11/chinas-spaceplane-projects-past-present-and-future/"},{"by":"dazosan","descendants":75,"id":23142590,"kids":[23143230,23143251,23144402,23143788,23143458,23144874,23143186,23144843,23143692,23143257,23143164],"score":61,"time":1589207822,"title":"Got a sweet tooth?

is a genuine question.<p>Isn&#x27;t a lockdown in a free market system inherently unfair? If some businesses are forced to shut down and many people are forced to stop working and therefore giving up their ability to provide for themselves, whilst others are allowed to continue their work then surely that is giving some <i>priviledged elites</i> an inherent and unfair advantage, not just during the lockdown but even for many months and years after, since everyone else will be in recovery mode&#x2F;damage control for quite some time while whilst others will continue to &quot;expand&quot;.<p>That makes me think that the only ethical way of enforcing a temporary lockdown would be to also transition to a temporary marxist system.

If we enforce a lockdown then surely we should do it the right way?<p>Obviously if that was the case then I&#x27;m not sure if many people who are in favour of a lockdown today would be still in favour tomorrow, but everything else just feels wrong.<p>I know that on HN the majority of readers still work (from home), have above average incomes, and generally cushy lives in comparision to the general population, so it&#x27;s easy from our point of view to strognly advocate for a long and extensive lockdown, but would you all be prepared to give up 100% of your wages and live in a communist society until the lockdown has been lifted? After all who cares about economy (including yours) when lives are at risk, right?<p>If you wouldn&#x27;t be prepared to those measures, why not?

Today, many respected private and public schools offer at least a few degrees fully online and with the recent COVID-19 crisis, many traditional students have been quickly and sloppily forced online, and in my experience, this has led to a lot of these students having much disdain towards online education, at least the process. Online education in all forms also gets touted as inferior due to lack of or reduced support and the loss of many labs which are too expensive or just not possible to replicate in home. Many argue the content delivery is worse, often old and that the program from an online degree is low quality in general. But what about credentialing? Most degrees from a legitimate school of course, won&#x27;t have any explicit indication it was done online, however there are a handful of cases, where I imagine it could be deduced.<p>I&#x27;d

The rest follows from the binomial proof of the little theorem (see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Proofs_of_Fermat%27s_little_theorem).","time":1588527973,"title":"Tell HN: Fermat's Little Theorem fails on complex numbers","type":"story"},{"by":"ceohockey60","descendants":111,"id":23060522,"kids":[23061351,23062108,23061939,23061451,23061554,23061597,23064223,23062460,23061490,23063711,23062199,23065027,23066228,23061396,23061699,23065241,23065699,23061361,23061741],"score":91,"time":1588527324,"title":"Is the Cloud Recession-Proof?","type":"story","url":"https://interconnected.blog/is-the-cloud-recession-proof/"},{"by":"burlesona","descendants":2,"id":23060178,"kids":[23060250,23060195],"score":2,"text":"My previous understanding was that, after submitting a URL, it was polite to post a comment saying basically what you thought was interesting &#x2F; worth reading about the article.<p>It looks like HN has changed this so that you cannot comment on an article after you submit it.<p>Sorry if this was already announced, I did try to search for an announcement and didn’t see one.

I would like to buy domains from a wide variety of TLDs, be able to administer DNS etc from a sensible control panel, and have clear billing so I&#x27;m not spending time deciphering things.<p>Who should I look at? Who should I avoid?<p>Thank you in advance for advice and feedback.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.uk&#x2F;transition","time":1588499282,"title":"Ask HN: No-bullshit UK-based domain registrars","type":"story"},{"by":"ingve","descendants":12,"id":23057969,"kids":[23064990,23059405,23061191],"score":80,"time":1588498961,"title":"Reverse-engineering the audio chip in the Nintendo Game Boy Color","type":"story","url":"http://www.righto.com/2020/05/reverse-engineering-audio-chip-in.html"},{"by":"based2","descendants":9,"id":23057940,"kids":[23061167,23060364,23061015,23061013,23060465,23059933],"score":64,"time":1588498401,"title":"I Accidentaly Wrote a Compile-Time Executable State Machine","type":"story","url":"https://philippegroarke.com/posts/2020/constexpr_fsm/"},{"by":"makaroni1","descendants":3,"id":23057833,"kids":[23058126,23057926],"score":16,"time":1588496422,"title":"Powerful House committee demands Jeff Bezos testify after ‘misleading’","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/01/powerful-house-committee-demands-jeff-bezos-testify-after-misleading-statements-on-how-amazon-develops-its-own-products/"},{"by":"mukgupta","descendants":11,"id":23057697,"kids":[23057941,23060108,23057998,23059445,23072654,23074769,23058368,23059597,23064244,23061256,23057891],"score":9,"text":"Consider the following scenario:<p>a) You tell me something you desperately want to be good at and make a commitment\nb) I follow up with you on a regular basis (email&#x2F;phone&#x2F;video), track your progress and send you reports occasionally","time":1588494368,"title":"Ask HN: Will you pay me for this?","type":"story"},{"by":"snailletters","descendants":7,"id":23057700,"kids":[23059545,23059912,23061692,23060549],"score":22,"time":1588494416,"title":"The Phenomenologically Distributed Human Parasite M0 (1998)","type":"story","url":"https://www.datapacrat.com/Opinion/Reciprocality/r1/index.html"},{"by":"lma21","descendants":8,"id":23057686,"kids":[23057769,23057916],"score":9,"text":"Would you use them to version sensitive data?<p>Would Gitlab&#x2F;Github have access to the underlying content&#x2F;history?<p>I wouldn’t use them to store passwords or banking-related information, though how about medical&#x2F;income&#x2F;taxation documents or information?","time":1588494123,"title":"Ask HN: How secure are private Git repositories?","type":"story"},{"by":"Foe","descendants":23,"id":23057512,"kids":[23059503,23057985,23091330,23060255],"score":198,"time":1588491622,"title":"Intel Virtualisation: How VT-X, KVM and QEMU Work Together","type":"story","url":"https://binarydebt.wordpress.com/2018/10/14/intel-virtualisation-how-vt-x-kvm-and-qemu-work-together/"},{"by":"known","descendants":94,"id":23057569,"kids":[23058229,23058275,23059264,23058304,23059479,23060056,23060280,23058252,23058490,23058465,23058431,23058367],"score":193,"time":1588492454,"title":"Love Bug worm's creator tracked down to repair shop in Manila","type":"story","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52458765"},{"by":"rvz","descendants":18,"id":23057406,"kids":[23059112,23057592,23057638,23057593,23057589,23060845,23057571,23058804,23058481],"score":60,"time":1588489858,"title":"Berkshire Hathaway sells US airline shares","type":"story","url":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52518186"},{"by":"wizardofmysore","descendants":8,"id":23057426,"kids":[23059558,23059757,23058331,23058629,23057710,23057543],"score":10,"time":1588490298,"title":"Ask HN: How do you manage your todos?","type":"story"},{"by":"ruph123","descendants":222,"id":23057411,"kids":[23061260,23061885,23059676,23062426,23061458,23061128,23061221,23061332,23061562,23064198,23061991,23061786,23061259,23061209,23059362,23062787,23062981,23060233,23062697,23062985,23062214,23059931,23061439,23059867,23062964,23061205,23060983,23060531,23062685,23061802,23061877,23062628,23064753,23063335,23064521,23062465,23065383,23061382,23062179,23061448,23062700,23067055,23067098,23061707,23065459,23061648,23192188,23064406,23061744,23064362,23068791,23061477,23067300,23065183,23113760,23075549,23062095,23061211,23062229,23063237,23060080,23066660,23067712,23062689,23117597,23061561,23074702,23063103,23062170,23065769,23062749,23062413,23064713,23061373,23061495,23069928,23060367,23062216,23063050,23061229,23061652,23062833,23061174,23062830,23060989,23062673,23063723,23064085,23075176,23063768,23062056,23061565,23062147,23061360,23070585,23062173,23065850,23073347,23062407,23062937,23063942,23126339,23061417,23061583,23064490,23062734,23069213,23064034,23059363,23065732],"score":666,"text":"I often feel overwhelmed by the amount of things I either wish to know or that I should know already.<p>Be it theoretical knowledge about ML, CS, mechanics, math topics.

in my high school days, I was your typical next door script kiddie. I knew x86 assembly and a few programming languages, was capable of hacking some crackmes, SQL injection and the like.<p>That&#x27;s just to say I always had the mindset of breaking stuff. However, lack of resources and guidance, and just life in general, led to a different career path for me as an adult.<p>About 10 years later now, I have had a relatively successful career in software development – though I feel I have so so much to learn yet. I still don&#x27;t feel like a &quot;senior&quot; dev, even though some would say I am.<p>My desire to &quot;break&quot; things has never diminished, however. I have fun doing various exploitation CTF challenges, (e.g. exploit.education), but that&#x27;s where my hacking skills stop.<p>I would like to start working on &quot;real&quot; exploitation, like browser or kernel exploitation, but at this point I&#x27;m wondering whether that&#x27;s the right thing to do. I know it&#x27;s not too late to get started in the literal sense, but I feel like perhaps focusing on improving myself on the development side of things is a better use of my time.<p>Heck, maybe I&#x27;ve already made my decision subconsciously, and I&#x27;m hoping a bunch of internet strangers will approve that decision. Time is a finite resource, and I don&#x27;t know what the best decision would be for me. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a lot of people who&#x27;ve been on the same situation before, so I&#x27;d appreciate your thoughts and experiences.","time":1588437280,"title":"Ask HN: Should I just give up my ambition of being a decent security researcher?","type":"story"},{"by":"bluegopher","descendants":28,"id":23052706,"kids":[23053895,23053818,23053727,23054113,23053691,23054226,23053805,23053531,23057303,23053407,23055492],"score":27,"time":1588436528,"title":"Why SARS-CoV-2 Bluetooth contact tracing apps are a tremendously stupid idea","type":"story","url":"https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/covid-19-bluetooth-contact-tracing-stupid-idea/"},{"by":"erdemdevge","descendants":3,"id":23052683,"kids":[23053088,23052684],"score":3,"time":1588436398,"title":"I created social version of Wikipedia","type":"story","url":"https://thinkingpedia.herokuapp.com/"},{"by":"kho","descendants":49,"id":23052674,"kids":[23056846,23056355,23059407,23058276,23056753,23057920,23056309,23056371,23056280],"score":141,"time":1588436346,"title":"Speculating on the Animal Crossing Turnip Market","type":"story","url":"https://insignificantbits.com/2020/05/02/turnips/"},{"by":"_4bcr","descendants":95,"id":23052559,"kids":[23053293,23053012,23053115,23053154,23056088,23053023,23053220,23053893,23057044,23053120,23055045,23054149,23058537,23053511,23052903,23053942,23062065,23057101,23053864,23056637,23055872,23056202,23053453,23056644,23055830],"score":105,"time":1588435592,"title":"When bad UX is good","type":"story","url":"https://herebeseaswines.net/essays/2020-05-02-when-bad-ux-is-good"},{"by":"ryzalyusoff","descendants":3,"id":23052506,"kids":[23052507,23052606],"score":4,"time":1588435220,"title":"Show HN: Highlight, annotate, bookmark and organize online research","type":"story","url":"https://readermode.io/premium"},{"by":"AndrewBissell","descendants":17,"id":23052918,"kids":[23054164,23053732,23079642,23056972,23053916,23054601],"score":33,"time":1588437690,"title":"Harvard professor placed on leave after report details his connection to Epstein","type":"story","url":"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/5/2/epstein-review-nowak-leave/"},{"by":"santiagocepeda","descendants":0,"id":23052454,"kids":[23053174,23053173],"score":1,"time":1588434864,"title":"Show HN: Find and rate the newest Angular, React and Vue tutorials","type":"story","url":"http://ranktutorials.com"},{"by":"todsacerdoti","descendants":43,"id":23052433,"kids":[23059709,23057866,23058762,23061402,23059569,23060293,23058224],"score":229,"time":1588434721,"title":"Rust in an Instant","type":"story","url":"https://fnordig.de/2020/05/02/rust-in-an-instant/"},{"by":"ericb","descendants":36,"id":23052383,"kids":[23052672,23053323,23052763,23052892,23054941,23053573,23052829,23053243,23052799,23053471,23052685,23052904,23053255,23053107],"score":61,"time":1588434353,"title":"Preliminary evidence that MMR vaccine might provide protection against Covid-19","type":"story","url":"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.20053207v1"},{"by":"JamesMcd","descendants":4,"id":23052346,"kids":[23054000,23053615,23055014,23055153],"score":26,"time":1588434006,"title":"Original Star Wars Battlefront gets multiplayer again, 16 years after release","type":"story","url":"https://gamenationworld.com/gaming/star-wars-battlefront-multiplayer-again"},{"by":"lelf","descendants":88,"id":23052300,"kids":[23053225,23054174,23053210,23053070,23053444,23054488,23055482,23056131,23054784,23054278,23055387,23055738,23056941,23055292,23062622,23057367,23052440,23054236,23058440],"score":114,"time":1588433531,"title":"History of Logo","type":"story","url":"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1623m1p3"},{"by":"todsacerdoti","descendants":34,"id":23052299,"kids":[23054426,23054895,23053800,23054617,23055989,23054002,23054582,23056883,23053739,23053501,23055920,23056889,23054882],"score":131,"time":1588433519,"title":"Concurrent Hash Tables: Fast and General?

He&#x27;s been a veteran of the industry for many years, he&#x27;s in his 40s, and his ex-wife (I think she may have been a long term fiance), are not really getting along. They seem friendly enough, but I&#x27;ve noticed in meetings there is a definite &quot;frenemy&quot; vibe, and I don&#x27;t really know how to deal with the situation. I&#x27;m a pretty junior developer in the organization, so it&#x27;s not my place to speak up. But I can tell it&#x27;s been weird for other people in my department too.

We&#x27;re a team of YC founders (Meldium W13, Draft S11, TapEngage S11) launching something new (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getcensus.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getcensus.com</a>). How many times has your business team asked you to generate yet another CSV file, write a ”quick report” in SQL, or send some custom data to a terrible API (looking at you Marketo)?<p>We’ve built a product that connects directly to your data warehouse and syncs into apps like Salesforce, Customer.io and even Google Sheets. In fact, your business teams won’t even need to rely on engineering to manage all these pipelines.<p>The tech stack for analyzing customer data in 2020 looks pretty great. You can load almost any data into an auto-scaling data warehouse (Snowflake, BigQuery) with easy point &amp; click tools like Fivetran. You can build SQL models with dbt and create visual reports in Metabase.

I live in the midwest, USA. I love doing interviews and solving algorithm questions.<p>Background:<p>I interviewed at Palo Alto, CA office about a year ago and although it went well and I answered all the questions I was told: &quot;this position wasn&#x27;t a best fit for me&quot; ...<p>A few weeks ago I was reached out by an Amazon recruiter about an opportunity in the Seattle area and I was told the previous recruiter did not find a best match for me and she apologized for wasting my time. She said they would like to do a another round of interviews. As I love challenging myself, I said yes and I did a screening which I was given 2 algorithm questions and about 2 hours and I solved both of them and all my unit tests passed.<p>For the second round of the interview, it was all online for 4 hours and I solved all questions and my code passed all unit tests for all their algorithm problems.<p>Today I got a call from the recruiter saying that I was rejected because &quot;my technical skills were lacking&quot;. I didn&#x27;t want to argue with the recruiter so I accepted the feedback. I just wanted to share my story because I always saw these interviews with Amazon and Google as a challenge but now I feel like they are a complete joke.<p>People who interviewed me were so arrogant and clueless.

This is already available for AutoCAD (they call it Generative Design).","time":1588203904,"title":"Ask HN: What will the far future of programming be like?","type":"story"},{"by":"Tiggers","descendants":2,"id":23025861,"kids":[23030827,23028177],"score":10,"time":1588203361,"title":"Why a greater depression for the 2020s is inevitable","type":"story","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/29/ten-reasons-why-greater-depression-for-the-2020s-is-inevitable-covid"},{"by":"benbreen","descendants":3,"id":23025766,"kids":[23031862,23034292,23036501],"score":41,"time":1588202533,"title":"The Bateson Building (2016)","type":"story","url":"https://jsah.ucpress.edu/content/75/4/469"},{"by":"mxfurman","descendants":227,"id":23025756,"kids":[23027833,23026196,23026421,23034409,23027786,23026651,23026136,23028176,23030895,23026535,23029083,23031420,23027639,23028639,23031312,23026730,23028082,23026968,23029157,23026168,23026394,23026345,23030908,23030695,23027682,23029640,23028961,23026590,23026939,23028512,23042022,23030262,23026528,23026458,23032667,23030160,23054356,23029007,23035262,23038264,23026680,23029576],"score":770,"time":1588202448,"title":"SSH hacks – a little sanity for remote workers","type":"story","url":"https://smallstep.com/blog/ssh-tricks-and-tips/"},{"by":"KKKKkkkk1","descendants":86,"id":23025627,"kids":[23030548,23027963,23029040,23030953,23027970,23028577,23029921,23030502,23027865,23028665],"score":126,"time":1588201560,"title":"Mark Zuckerberg Asserts Control of Facebook, Pushing Aside Dissenters","type":"story","url":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/mark-zuckerberg-asserts-control-of-facebook-pushing-aside-dissenters-11588106984"},{"by":"justavm","descendants":2,"id":23025510,"kids":[23025513,23026396],"score":4,"text":"Hi All,<p>I wrote a Dakvik VM from scratch in C with the following major features below, need your help to find my next steps.<p>* &gt;1M instructions on STM32 based BluePill board(&lt;$3).\n* Precise compacting GC.\n* Interrupt support.\n* Native C interface generator.\n* Platform abstraction layer for HW peripherals.\n* Arrays, Float, Switch, Exception, Interface, Multiple inheritance, dynamic and etc.\n* Believe or not RXJava lie programming is possible, sort of :).<p>Features not available on master branch;\n* MultiThreading (Developed a simple preemptive rtos for cortex m but not integrated yet.)\n* Shared Library support.

I have about 7 years of professional working experience. Last 4 years has been in the area of full-stack development (Typescript, MySQL, AWS, etc). Prior to that, I spent 3 years working on Android OS, but more on the frameworks layer (Java, C++, C), while also having some level of exposures on low-level Android code (i.e. HAL) and Linux kernel programming.<p>I&#x27;ve been really interested to have a career in a low-level system programming, especially in Linux kernel. But there are some obstacles: (1) Other than hacking as a hobby on the side, I don&#x27;t have a concrete portfolio in system programming that I can show off to get an interview. (2) I&#x27;m currently based in South East Asia (Singapore), and it doesn&#x27;t seem like there&#x27;s that many system programming positions here?<p>I&#x27;m very tempted to take a few months off, to focus on building a portfolio around system programming. My questions are: (1) what would be a good project to work on or OSS to contribute to land a system programming job? (2) what career prospect is there for Linux kernel development? (3) what are the recommended system programming language with good career prospects? (4) how hard it is to get a remote system programming job? (5) is it a good idea to get an internship position to get my feet wet vs. just building a side project?<p>I&#x27;d really appreciate it if somebody in the industry can enlighten me :)","time":1588038120,"title":"Ask HN: Moving into System Engineering","type":"story"},{"by":"dhhwrongagain","dead":true,"id":23002288,"kids":[23002711,23003009,23003047],"score":29,"time":1588036956,"title":"Leaked Amazon Doc: Diversity Inversely Correlated with Unionization","type":"story","url":"http://archive.fo/1khJw"},{"by":"elliekelly","descendants":11,"id":23002148,"kids":[23002552,23002566,23005933,23005984],"score":40,"time":1588035659,"title":"Zoom accidentally sent meeting host transcript of coworkers private chat","type":"story","url":"https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/04/dear-prudence-coworkers-private-dm-zoom-mocking-weight.html"},{"by":"t23","descendants":4,"id":23001870,"kids":[23001999,23002156,23002535],"score":21,"time":1588033100,"title":"Facebook investors launch third attempt to remove Mark Zuckerberg as chairman","type":"story","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8261775/Facebook-investors-launch-attempt-remove-Mark-Zuckerberg-chairman.html"},{"by":"panic","descendants":69,"id":23001831,"kids":[23002280,23002331,23003527,23002849,23002047,23002797,23003323,23002865,23007462,23003434,23002793,23002296,23004590,23005094,23002182,23002968,23005042,23002702,23009795,23003684,23018989,23002158],"score":420,"time":1588032769,"title":"Let’s Invent B(+)-Trees","type":"story","url":"https://shachaf.net/w/b-trees"},{"by":"josvdwest","descendants":3,"id":23001718,"kids":[23002496,23001824],"score":1,"text":"Hi HN,<p>I&#x27;m Jos van der Westhuizen, co-founder of Nexus (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thenexusfamily.com&#x2F;).
