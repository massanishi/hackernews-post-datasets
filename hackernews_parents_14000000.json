HN, we are the founders of WittyThumbs (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wittythumbs.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wittythumbs.com&#x2F;</a>), a place for people to learn how to improve their online-dating conversations. We started this company because it’s the resource we wish we had years ago.<p>The two of us had that sinking feeling in our early 20s that we’d missed our best opportunity to date because while everyone seemed to have thriving dating lives in high school and college, we were preoccupied by more “nerdy” endeavors. Having focused on career at an early age, we were relatively clueless about dating.<p>We spent years dissecting dating and learning the skills piece by piece, like it was an engineering problem. The skills and confidence eventually clicked for us. We discovered rules we could follow to help us navigate the messy world of modern dating. Looking back, we saw no reason why it had to be a grueling 10-year process. We started blogging about texting techniques and Lior coached dating professionally for in-person clients.<p>Having earned a reputation among our friends for being dating and texting gurus, it got to the point where tons of friends were asking us for advice every time we’d hang out. Liron wrote some custom chat software that organized all the shared texts and screenshots of various men talking to various women. Suddenly we were all hanging out in these chatrooms and analyzing one another’s texts. So we’ve seen signs that many people really need this kind of dating advice.<p>On WittyThumbs, you can post anonymized online-dating conversations you’ve had and get feedback from our team of experts and the user community. You can also request a private 1-on-1 chat with an expert to get realtime advice about a conversation, or about any dating subject.<p>We’d be happy to answer any questions you have about us, our company, or plans for the future.","time":1496690026,"title":"Launch HN: WittyThumbs (YC S17) – We help improve online-dating conversations","type":"story"},{"by":"mhb","descendants":90,"id":14490414,"kids":[14490921,14490915,14491065,14492965,14495932,14490755,14491381,14490964,14490863,14492813,14491092,14490714,14491347,14492243,14490982,14491416,14490834,14491363,14490733,14496720,14490856,14493461,14492172,14499110,14495463,14493120,14490854,14493654,14492370,14491028,14491079,14491517],"score":179,"time":1496689698,"title":"Why aren’t Google and Facebook enriching our lives more?","type":"story","url":"http://blogs.harvard.edu/philg/2017/06/05/why-arent-google-and-facebook-enriching-our-lives"},{"by":"forlorn","descendants":2,"id":14490432,"kids":[14490434,14490465],"score":7,"text":"Drops error code 500 (Server Error) here and there.

every visual programming tool I&#x27;ve seen on HN looks so cool when I see the gif, but when I start using it, it&#x27;s invariably a frustrating experience. I think it might be because customizing the last 20% is difficult visually, and you so you have to drop down to code. But once you&#x27;re in visual programming land, changing abstraction layers is difficult.<p>When I asked Alan Kay this question, his first response was &quot;well there are various types of visual programming, some of them have taken off&quot;. The type of visual programming I&#x27;m thinking about here is a WYSIWYG drag and drop interface for building UIs. Imagine having prebuilt views (tables, buttons, dropdowns, etc.) and being able to drag them and lay them out how you want. Then you interact with their API: this table pulls in data from this SQL statement; this button executes this HTTP query; this dropdown publishes this value, which this SQL statement uses via string interpolation. These &quot;widgets&quot; publish their data, which can be used by other widgets (w1.value), and inside SQL queries. The tables can pull in data from SQL queries. You can use string interpolation inside SQL queries, so dropdowns can influence the query being run. So selecting a drop down value would cause the query to change, which would automatically propagate changes to the table.","time":1496603545,"title":"Ask HN: Why does visual programming suck?","type":"story"},{"by":"Tomte","descendants":65,"id":14480636,"kids":[14481714,14481899,14481689,14481512,14481617,14482380,14481710,14480813,14481502],"score":102,"time":1496570895,"title":"Best board games from Essen 2016","type":"story","url":"http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/10/best-board-games-of-essen-2016/"},{"by":"Nition","descendants":23,"id":14480579,"kids":[14482039,14481923,14483098,14480747,14481591,14484240,14480750,14481310],"score":250,"time":1496569854,"title":"Dolphin Emulator Progress Report","type":"story","url":"https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2017/06/03/dolphin-progress-report-may-2017/"},{"by":"tosh","descendants":29,"id":14480559,"kids":[14481333,14480838,14483425,14482074,14499654,14482076],"score":142,"time":1496569393,"title":"Clojure Linear Algebra Refresher: 1 – Vector Spaces","type":"story","url":"http://dragan.rocks/articles/17/Clojure-Linear-Algebra-Refresher-Vector-Spaces"},{"by":"secretsinger","descendants":31,"id":14480550,"kids":[14482384,14482657,14482225,14485261],"score":79,"time":1496569112,"title":"Estimating a nuclear blast with bits of paper","type":"story","url":"http://www.dannen.com/decision/fermi.html"},{"by":"patrics123","descendants":1,"id":14480498,"kids":[14480504,14481524],"score":5,"text":"Just read this piece \nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;join-scout&#x2F;the-rise-of-the-weaponized-ai-propaganda-machine-86dac61668b<p>tldr:\nBot Networks and Micro targeting are used to manipulate your opinions and spread propaganda 1-on-1<p>You wanna win an election in your home town or Country?

That&#x27;s my situation at the moment. I&#x27;m a software engineer who doesn&#x27;t have any peers that work a similar job. I also lost my job, and socially I mostly keep to myself as an introvert. Also, I am not entry-level in this. I have been in the field since 2007.<p>I was laid off from my last job and my ex-employer doesn&#x27;t know anyone else that is looking to hire a software engineer. He just sometimes messages me saying &quot;I might have some work for you to do&quot; as short term gigs but it&#x27;s nothing full-time and not sustainable at all to make a living of.<p>With that said, I started submitting job applications as a total stranger, but also tried hitting up the people I already know. It is then that I realized none of my local  friends are in software engineering.<p>I posted an announcement on my Facebook wall saying I&#x27;m currently in the market and that if anyone knows anyone that&#x27;s hiring for a SWE to send me a message.<p>I didn&#x27;t get replies from the post (have 120 or so FB friends). One of my friends re-posted it with similar wording, but he didn&#x27;t get any replies either.<p>So now I&#x27;m thinking that I&#x27;m approaching my network wrong.

Over the past few years I&#x27;ve seen several instances where historically significant members of the software, hacker, or open source community have fallen on hard times enough to be reduced to fundraising for medical assistance, and&#x2F;or being forced to abandon their open source efforts due to inability to survive doing it. Latest in long line of examples is Captain Crunch (John Draper), one of the fathers of phone phreaking [0]. In fact, he got Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs into phreaking, and their first business before building Apple I was building and selling blue boxes [1]. In a way, without their meeting, there may not have been an Apple.<p>In this case, a massive part of the blame is of course with the US health care system, which basically makes it extremely difficult to survive old age unless you have a retirement plan and insurance - things that many self-employed developers never had.<p>The question I&#x27;d like to raise, however, is not &quot;what is the root cause&quot;, but rather &quot;what can we as a community do about it&quot;.

(It also doesn&#x27;t help that she just quit her rather time-consuming job, so now she doesn&#x27;t have anything to do all day.)<p>The problem is that I can&#x27;t focus on anything with just a few spare hours of time here and there.  The granularity of productive work for me is 6 to 8 hour chunks (heck, it takes at least an hour and a half to even get into a project).  But dinner at 7 PM would be right in the middle of the most productive time of the evening, so how do I work around this?<p>She seemed frazzled and on the verge of tears, so of course I&#x27;m going to do whatever I need to to make sure she is happy, but I&#x27;d rather not have to give up my side projects.  I feel like those hours are the only &quot;me&quot; time I have anymore (time that is conducive to my mental health no less).  Is anyone in a similar situation?

For these projects, I&#x27;m often working with one or two other students, and in the case of the many personal projects that I also work on, just myself. I often just need a place to track my own work on a project without any need for collaboration.<p>I currently manage these with Trello to keep track of them. While I like Trello, creating a card for a new feature doesn&#x27;t satisfy me because checklists don&#x27;t allow any additional information to be attached to them other than a line of text. A new board for each feature doesn&#x27;t make much sense either because its overkill and hard to track with the rest of the app. For those reasons I dislike Trello and want to move to something else for my various small group projects and personal projects. However, I find that services like Asana, Flow, ProofHub, etc. are all geared towards organizations and teams (which don&#x27;t work at all for my use case) and the pricing makes it impossible to purchase as an individual.<p>Todo lists like Todoist and Wunderlist are too basic and don&#x27;t support the features that I need for programming projects (markdown, ability to handle code, documentation ability for tasks, GitHub commits) and they generally don&#x27;t cater well do an application development workflow.<p>So my question is, with all of the more appropriate services (like Asana, etc.) being impossible to use as an individual, what do you use to manage your personal projects which don&#x27;t fit an organization structure?","time":1496330257,"title":"Ask HN: Which

An account with hash of public key: 0xe847F9abc3C8986De276648224E916821BD7D68f. This account basically sends the transaction forward to another account 0x8271b2e8cbe29396e9563229030c89679b9470db. A quick scan of the transaction reveals that this account is receiving a lot of transactions constantly and currently has over $1.6M in ETH.\nWho is this account transacting with? Well, some of the connected accounts (outgoing tx) have similar amounts of ethers – emptying accounts all the time. This is HUGE and been going on for a while!<p>Who owns this fraudulent account? A quick Google search and I land on a Poloniex conversation between zyplok and smallbit concerning a microtransaction from the same account gone awry. Zyplok owns the account. Who&#x27;s zyplok and what does the internet know about zyplok?<p>Well, a lot! For starters, Zyplok.com is a &quot;bitcoin mining&quot; system run by IG:shanefr0mmaine. A few more searches later, the github (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ar7ik) and an address in Portland, Maine.<p>So what&#x27;s next?

Hence no more element level styles. It also auto links the class to every instance of the component.<p>Under the hood, we are adding &lt;style&gt; nodes via JS and the browser has to generate the same class during every execution of the app&#x2F;page (showcased as a feature - no build process). IMHO, this does not seem to bring in any advantage over the fact that browsers can easily parse external stylesheets once and cache them.<p>Consider the case where you are creating a UI framework from scratch. You would encounter nested elements, e.g. button inside a modal needs to be different than a button inside a hero component.<p>Of course having the ability to add custom CSS via JS is a good feature to have.

Smart contracts?<p>Much obliged for any insight.","time":1496120924,"title":"Ask HN: How best to model a government programmatically?","type":"story"},{"by":"CiPHPerCoder","descendants":30,"id":14443191,"kids":[14451715,14450652,14451149,14451253,14450392,14452826,14452187,14452166,14450440,14451575,14451806],"score":59,"time":1496123770,"title":"Building Searchable Encrypted Databases with PHP and SQL","type":"story","url":"https://paragonie.com/blog/2017/05/building-searchable-encrypted-databases-with-php-and-sql"},{"by":"seryoiupfurds","descendants":2,"id":14443002,"kids":[14448596,14450912],"score":29,"time":1496118499,"title":"Userland xnr jit","type":"story","url":"http://www.tedunangst.com/flak/post/userland-xnr-jit"},{"by":"techolic","descendants":156,"id":14442971,"kids":[14443541,14443293,14443400,14443310,14443430,14443322,14443225,14443598,14443359,14444453,14443321,14444131,14444480,14443304,14443885,14443283,14444628,14443726,14444039,14443622,14443366,14444629,14443285],"score":269,"time":1496117699,"title":"Someone forged my resignation letter","type":"story","url":"https://workplace.stackexchange.com/questions/91643/someone-forged-my-resignation-letter"},{"by":"memset","descendants":16,"id":14443040,"kids":[14451776,14450257,14449861,14450298,14449881],"score":44,"time":1496119411,"title":"Remaining Trouble Spots with Computational Thinking","type":"story","url":"https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2017/6/217742-remaining-trouble-spots-with-computational-thinking/fulltext"},{"by":"DeanYeong","descendants":68,"id":14442943,"kids":[14443117,14445028,14443284,14443416,14443972,14444861,14445289,14443286,14442982,14444182,14444966,14451191,14444990,14444317,14443481,14444995,14444849],"score":92,"time":1496116898,"title":"How to read more: Simple three-step system","type":"story","url":"https://deanyeong.com/read-more-books/"},{"by":"dawhizkid","descendants":13,"id":14442737,"kids":[14442899,14445241,14444906,14446981,14446056,14442818],"score":5,"text":"I&#x27;m wondering if the only reason it doesn&#x27;t exist yet is the big legal question around food safety&#x2F;food handling.","time":1496112239,"title":"Ask HN: What would it take to build the Etsy of Food?","type":"story"},{"by":"melqdusy","descendants":49,"id":14442715,"kids":[14443065,14444066,14442975,14445549,14444521,14445918,14443298,14442996,14445819],"score":97,"time":1496111854,"title":"Notes on debugging Clojure code","type":"story","url":"http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2017/notes-on-debugging-clojure-code/"},{"by":"habosa","descendants":4,"id":14442706,"kids":[14443895,14442999,14444538],"score":20,"text":"I&#x27;m an experienced Android developer, always considered doing freelance work but no idea how to begin (only ever been employed by large companies).<p>So for all the successful freelancers out there:<p><pre><code>  * How did you get your first customer?  \n\n  * Where do you get most of your work?\n\n  * Do you work alone?

Competitor looks to be based in CA also.<p>A friend and I have been building an app as a little side project for a few years. With work and real-life etc. it&#x27;s been stuck in beta for quite some time, but we were actually hoping to launch this weekend.<p>Today we discover that a competitor launched with an identical concept. Fine, it&#x27;s an obvious concept that I was surprised no-one had come up with already, and we lifted a large part of the UI from Tinder anyway. What I&#x27;m concerned about is that they also copied the name (changing one letter: Chowder (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getchowder.com) -&gt; Chowdr (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chowdrapp.com)) and filed a trademark.<p>Is there prior art for trademarks in the US (we have been publicly visible as Chowder since ~February 2016, it seems their trademark was filed in March 2016)? I was able to find some info about the trademark (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bizapedia.com&#x2F;trademarks&#x2F;chowdr-87042422.html) - of note is that they have a pseudo-mark for &#x27;Chowder&#x27; as well.<p>While I&#x27;m annoyed that this person lifted the concept and the name, I am more worried that they will make a trademark infringement move on us as soon as we launch properly, which we cannot afford to defend against.<p>If it makes any difference, we have the option to become a registered company in the UK (where I am based), however we planned to launch in the US initially anyway, so I assume this would still classify as infringement?<p>Any advice would be appreciated.

   Greetings Hacker News,\n</code></pre>\nThe company I work for uses a coding project to help vet developers in our interview process; this is something I have been thinking about how to improve upon, as we use a mix of often poor fitting tools and manual processes in this stage of the interview. As an example we use our in house git repo manager to store and review applicant code, which is challenging because we either get a huge number of repositories created unrelated to our actual work, or continually need to keep sticking assignments down into a single repository which gets big and&#x2F;or ugly as time goes on. Actually executing code submitted is also painful sometimes as not everyone interviewing who wants to test the code knows how to meaningfully sandbox it, which creates additional headaches when things go off the rails. These problems in the process are important for us as it often creates huge distractions from the actual work that needs to get done.<p>Does the company or organization you work for today use a coding project as part of the interview process?

My subjective sense is that I can become a lot more productive than I currently am.<p>Conventional wisdom says that it&#x27;s important to build and iterate quickly. Technical skills (amongst other things) are necessary if you want to build and iterate quickly. So then, it seems worthwhile to develop your technical skills before pursuing a startup. To what extent is this true?<p>Furthermore, domain expertise seems to be important:<p>&gt;&gt; You want to know how to paint a perfect painting? It&#x27;s easy. Make yourself perfect and then just paint naturally.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve wondered about that passage since I read it in high school. I&#x27;m not sure how useful his advice is for painting specifically, but it fits this situation well.

Fast forward to today and we&#x27;re profitable, growing steadily, debt free and are about to be acquired (there are LOIs on the table). You may ask what the problem is? Well, the problem is that I&#x27;m supremely unhappy.<p>Each morning for the past couple months, my first thought has been &quot;What could today be like if I didn&#x27;t work here?&quot;. I drift off into exploring what it would be like to work at Wal Mart, or the construction site outside, or as a bagger at a grocery store. It seems so stress free. Then, my phone starts ringing for the day and I&#x27;m snapped back to reality. This morning, I locked myself in the bathroom with the shower running (don&#x27;t want wife to know) and cried my eyes out. I haven&#x27;t cried in many years. It felt great, but only for an hour.<p>So, from my (possibly skewed) point of view, I have 2 options:<p>- Quit, which effectively kills any acquisition and likely the company as well<p>- Suck it up and work on the same thing for 2-5 more years<p>I&#x27;d been mulling over a third option (hire someone to do my day-to-day), but don&#x27;t know how to make it work. The product is just too complicated (tons of domain knowledge required) for someone to come in and take over. Additionally, the product just isn&#x27;t that interesting (glorified CRUD app) and it&#x27;s been hard to retain developers.<p>Please tell me I&#x27;m missing something! Maybe I&#x27;m just being ridiculous- it&#x27;s getting hard to tell. Is it common for a Founder to go through this train of thought before an acquisition?

It&#x27;s just this amazing way of thinking.&quot;<p>Another blog post, &quot;Six programming paradigms that will change how you think about coding&quot;, mentioned Prolog as an example of the mind-expanding &quot;declarative programming&quot; paradigm, which got me curious enough to start experimenting with it.<p>As an experienced programmer in C++, Python, SQL and other languages, I found myself thinking, &quot;I could do all this quite easily with a relational database, or with structured data types in a mainstream language.&quot; Defining relationships between data (e.g. &quot;likes(fred, apple).&quot;), boolean predicates (&quot;is_fruit_eater(X).&quot;), etc., could be represented easily with boolean fields, boolean functions, and so on. And searching through your data for certain conditions is pretty trivial with a for loop or recursive search, with the added bonus that you know what the hell is going on algorithmically without having to read the Prolog interpreter&#x27;s source code.<p>But: I&#x27;m a Prolog ignoramus at this point and have only scratched the surface, so I wanted to see if any Prolog veterans on here could shed some light. Is there a moment of enlightenment that comes with a little more persistence and study? Am I missing something? Can it be summed up in mainstream-language terms?<p>People giving advice online seem to take the attitude of &quot;learn everything you possibly can, it can only help your programming knowledge&quot; but with finite time on earth and a bottomless supply of information out there (look at how deep you can go into the game of chess!) that always strikes me a bit glib and uninsightful.

Even worse, it seems that this is just the beginning: Windows will automatically download more inappropriate apps in the future.

Remove all of the irrelevant apps cluttering my machine, and prevent any more from being downloaded. Control of what is installed on my computer should rest with me, not with Microsoft.<p>2. Remove advertising from the operating system. I can&#x27;t believe anyone considers this acceptable.<p>3. Ensure Windows is respecting my privacy. I already changed the relevant settings [1] to off&#x2F;basic when installing Windows - is there anything else I should do?<p>4. Prevent the OS from restarting to install Windows updates, except when specifically told to do so.<p>With Windows 10, I&#x27;m so pleased that I can do most of my work in Linux and macOS.

Some lose money, but they still produce quite a bit of subjective value and have valuations that are high to match. I know Twitter might lose value over time, but it&#x27;s going to be in the billions for a while.<p>Reddit has more site visitors, way longer time spent on website, and more pages viewed per user than most of the sites on the list.

I&#x27;ve also heard that it only makes $10 million a year in revenue.<p>So why is Reddit&#x27;s revenue and valuation so low? It&#x27;s not as if it&#x27;s worthless to advertisers - there&#x27;s a fair amount of preference data to be gleaned from users based on which sites they visit and so on. Is it bad management?

That changed. Software engineering and powerlifting are just things I can do, hopefully, good and enjoy in the process. But thats not who I am. I like to think of myself as beeing an enabler. Someone who wanna help others improve. At the gym I always like to help others, give them tips and are happy if it works out for them. At my job its the same. If someone has a question or needs help otherwise, I try my best to help.<p>Currently I am looking for a new job opportunity (not really applying but looking around). But I am not sure for what I should look. I thought of something like a team lead position or something like that. My idea behind this is, that for me a team lead is a person who enables his team to work good. That sounds like a match for me. But I am not completely sure that this is really what I want. With this post I hope to get some additional ideas from people who read this. I would love that :) So, if anything comes to mind, please share with me :) Thanks!","time":1495558607,"title":"Ask HN: Change career way – to what?","type":"story"},{"by":"dsr12","descendants":82,"id":14402776,"kids":[14404290,14403571,14403273,14403543,14403924,14405072,14404829],"score":91,"time":1495557925,"title":"A Man Who Made the Mistake of Trying to Help Wikileaks","type":"story","url":"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/jason-katz-wikileaks"},{"by":"blegh","descendants":16,"id":14402763,"kids":[14407823,14408120,14407697,14407717],"score":23,"time":1495557856,"title":"Lincoln Said What?

I didn&#x27;t find anything, but an idea came up that I wanted to work on and I enrolled in a coding bootcamps. I had some background so I finished their material in about a month (Node&#x2F;React). For various reason I switched to Rails and took another couple of months learning and build the idea as a learning tool. I have a lot of contacts in the target market and a background in sales and am confident that I can drive users to at least sign up. My SO and I can survive on one income.<p>The market<p>I am working on the idea alone. The market size is very small (approx 200k users worldwide), but affluent and currently underserved in the area the platform seeks to meet (essentially recruiting). Total revenue is hard to come by because the market is pretty opaque, but I estimate there is easily $50m&#x2F;yr spent in direct fees paid (indirect costs of the current system are much, much higher).

That said, the job opportunities there are a huge factor in whether I&#x27;ll actually go.<p>I&#x27;ve narrowed down to Madrid and Barcelona as the two best options, at least regarding jobs. So I&#x27;m asking for the opinions and advice of HNers who have lived &amp; worked in both those cities:<p>What shape is the tech sector in? \nWhat types of work are available? \nWhat do salaries look like, vs London&#x2F;Berlin&#x2F;Paris levels? \nHow limiting is it to not be fluent enough in Spanish for use at work, beyond chit-chat?\nIs contracting&#x2F;freelancing possible, without Spanish fluency?\nIs there is an obvious leader between the two cities, tech-scene wise? \nAre there any unintuitive factors to consider?<p>---<p>A bit of personal context, if it helps the advice to be a bit more concrete:<p>* I&#x27;d be going for senior developer roles. Most likely at small-mid size companies. Larger ones possibly, for the right job.<p>* My past jobs have been in the capital cities of Europe&#x27;s strongest economies. I&#x27;m aware that moving to Madrid or Barcelona will likely involve a pay cut in absolute terms. But this is a trade off I&#x27;m more than happy to make.<p>* I&#x27;m currently functional in Spanish but I have a long way to go until fluency. That&#x27;s one of my goals in moving to Spain. So I&#x27;m not put off by the language barrier for day to day life. It would be more of a near term concern if non fluency is severely career limiting, for example if it becomes a problem once you are anywhere above entry level positions, as is the case in some countries.","time":1495362373,"title":"Ask HN: What are the Madrid and Barcelona tech scenes like?","type":"story"},{"by":"dnetesn","descendants":11,"id":14386605,"kids":[14388583,14388567,14388199,14389221],"score":57,"time":1495362336,"title":"The Self-Medicating Animal","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/magazine/the-self-medicating-animal.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fscience&action=click&contentCollection=science&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=5&pgtype=sectionfront&_r=0"},{"by":"stemuk","descendants":83,"id":14386584,"kids":[14387739,14387146,14387205,14387515,14387356,14387168,14388154,14387436,14387738,14387445,14387159,14389365,14388594,14425490,14387164],"score":60,"time":1495361773,"title":"Hetzner Private Cloud","type":"story","url":"https://www.hetzner.de/us/hosting/produkte_vserver/private-cloud"},{"by":"shioyama","descendants":20,"id":14386723,"kids":[14387915,14390845,14389788,14387557,14389092],"score":94,"time":1495365093,"title":"The Ruby Module Builder Pattern","type":"story","url":"http://dejimata.com/2017/5/20/the-ruby-module-builder-pattern"},{"by":"tomahunt","descendants":32,"id":14386554,"kids":[14391064,14393968,14390869,14392554,14393903,14391920],"score":154,"time":1495361206,"title":"Topics in Core Mathematics at Graterford Prison","type":"story","url":"http://blogs.ams.org/phdplus/2017/05/18/topics-in-core-mathematics-at-graterford-prison/"},{"by":"robteix","descendants":68,"id":14386517,"kids":[14388523,14389294,14388024,14388308,14387209,14388450,14388031,14387850,14393582,14387206,14390002,14389075,14391502,14387371,14387208,14387758,14388535],"score":175,"time":1495360293,"title":"Nasa revives 'weird life forms' trapped inside crystals for 60,000 years","type":"story","url":"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/18/newly-discovered-weird-life-forms-may-offer-clue-life-mars/"},{"by":"avadhoot","descendants":9,"id":14386518,"kids":[14386578,14386572,14396170,14387562,14386782,14386527,14386571],"score":7,"time":1495360328,"title":"Ask HN: What is one app you can't live without?","type":"story"},{"by":"tetek","descendants":3,"id":14386525,"kids":[14386567,14386594,14386542],"score":3,"text":"I&#x27;ve moved 5 times in the last 7 years, and almost everywhere in the internet I have a wrong address.<p>Would it make sense to have a website which maps physical address to your login&#x2F;password?

I&#x27;ve used Windows Server 2000, 2012, 2016, etc.<p>Every single use case for Windows is plagues with the same problem for the last two dozen years.  Consistently, Windows freezes, locks up, crashes explorer, between 1 and 7 times per week.  I don&#x27;t miss this &quot;feature&quot; when I switched to Mac.  There was a phase on Mac that it would take a good 30 seconds to wake up after being asleep but this bug seems to go in an out.  I will trade this bug on Mac for daily Windows freezes anytime.<p>Since no one has ever addressed the issue, I&#x27;m finally calling out some common causes that I have seen.  The most common causes I have found aside from failing memory which is always a possibility:<p>1) Group policies\n2) DCOM permission errors\n3) RealTek audio drivers<p>Has anyone ever listed the group policies that cause Windows to lock up while they are updating every day at 3:00 PM?  I know they exist, and I would love to see a list.<p>DCOM, what is the point and why do I want remote access always available on my computer?  Why does Cortana need to have a constant connection, and why does DCOM errors in the event log cause Windows to lock up?<p>Finally, RealTek drivers.  These are the worst.  Why does an audio driver cause my entire desktop to crash?<p>If anyone could answer these questions for me, I would be eternally grateful and I will forward them to Microsoft promptly since in 24 years of using Windows, they still haven&#x27;t fixed these basic user experience problems.","time":1495211724,"title":"Why I switched to Mac after being a long time Windows evangelist","type":"story"},{"by":"nikunjk","descendants":86,"id":14377090,"kids":[14377197,14377247,14377519,14377581,14377372,14377407,14377225,14377381,14377787,14377242,14377501,14377196,14377647,14377207,14377459,14377213],"score":124,"time":1495210634,"title":"OxyContin's 12-hour problem (2016)","type":"story","url":"http://www.latimes.com/projects/oxycontin-part1/"},{"by":"Finbarr","descendants":74,"id":14377232,"kids":[14378549,14377980,14377878,14378067,14378119,14378134,14379419,14379209,14381093,14378886,14381081,14378072],"score":285,"time":1495211681,"title":"Bootsnap: Optimizing Ruby App Boot Time","type":"story","url":"https://engineering.shopify.com/235340559-bootsnap-optimizing-ruby-app-boot-time"},{"by":"wkoszek","descendants":3,"id":14377227,"kids":[14387244,14386858,14386398],"score":6,"time":1495211646,"title":"Ask HN: How do you drive traffic to your MVP website?","type":"story"},{"by":"CrankyBear","descendants":145,"id":14377243,"kids":[14377847,14377877,14377724,14377609,14378435,14377410,14377777,14378586,14378107,14379826,14378206,14378157,14377511,14378086,14378611],"score":200,"time":1495211732,"title":"Twitter abandons 'Do Not Track' privacy protection","type":"story","url":"http://www.zdnet.com/article/twitter-abandons-do-not-track-privacy-protection/"},{"by":"robteix","descendants":17,"id":14377076,"kids":[14378052,14377606,14377913,14378234,14379346],"score":37,"time":1495210573,"title":"Office distractions could be costing more than $30k per employee each year","type":"story","url":"https://hackernoon.com/office-distractions-could-be-costing-your-company-more-than-30k-per-high-performance-employee-each-ba7e4f772d78"},{"by":"Madawar","descendants":31,"id":14377068,"kids":[14377143,14382211,14378337,14385456,14379738,14377664,14410074,14381142,14379159,14377815,14381263,14381149,14378842,14380964,14379902,14377703,14384914,14380896,14381440,14380946,14383077,14381421,14382036,14378610,14378979,14379389,14378178,14379340,14378800,14377771],"score":11,"text":"I have recently started drinking up to 6 coffees per day.

keep my kids&#x27; minds engaged this summer (instead of letting them watch TV for 30 hours per day), and decided that a family summer project would be a great way of having fun as well as learning some new things (for all of us).  The project we decided on was to build a quadcopter drone.  In planning this out, I decided I wanted to document the entire process, use a Raspberry Pi as the core, and do as much of the engineering and software development as I could.  I realized that by using open source software, commodity hardware, open-sourcing all of the custom code that I write, and thoroughly documenting the entire process, I could provide a very educational guide for hobbyists to use at home, or even teachers to use in their classroms.<p>I mentioned this to a coworker, and he thought I should see if I could find a grant to help defray some of the costs associated with it.  Does anyone know of any organizations that provide grants for personal projects such as this?  The goal is to produce a completed product for under $250, but I fully recognize that there will be additional costs associated with building prototypes, buying the necessary tools, etc.  Ideally, I&#x27;d like the total cost of all the research, development, and engineering to be less than $1500 total (sub-$1000 is my real goal).  Since I want this to be useful in teaching children more about engineering and software development, it&#x27;s important to me that the expenses are minimal for the finished product.<p>Can anyone give me any leads on individuals, foundations, companies, etc. that might provide grants to help defray some of these costs?

So, once you discover this right domain, you can heavily slow down that variant of WannaCry by registering that domain and putting a webserver on it.<p>Why did the authors implement this? This effectively bounds the amount of money they receive from the attack. Clearly civic duty is not their priority, unless they are maybe trying to reach a balance between their reward and the amount of damage. But this is hard to support: ransomware infections always cause much more damage than the authors earn (according to available public estimates, WannaCry&#x27;s authors made less than 100 k$, which seems really small to me).<p>Also, why did they implement such a poor killswitch scheme? Everybody can register a domain, and the domain itself appears to be relatively simple to find in the code. They could have implemented an asymmetric encryption scheme, which only they would have been able to use.<p>Of course there is no way to know the actual reasons, but I still wonder: does anybody have

If a player using an Xbox kills a player using a PlayStation the data would be the same and therefore the player on PlayStation would be dead for all connected players regardless of the game platform they use. Firebase can integrate with Unity so it seems obvious that my thought experiment is possible unless of course the platforms are locked so as to only connect with players of the same platform. I suspect they are not and the game should be able to bypass a hurdle like that, again by means of using a database. I&#x27;ve had that thought experiment for several years, since 2006 I believe, so my only thought with that is that if it was possible it would have been done by now. I also feel Amazon Lumberyard could have functionality built-in to allow for cross-platform play as well with their deep integration to AWS, and with their integration to Twitch it seems to me that it should currently be the engine of choice if someone was starting a cross-platform game from scratch...<p>Does anybody have any insight toward this simple thought experiment?

am a Dutch high school student and last year I had to do a large project of my own choice. Together with two other guys I decided to do a project about digital logic. We had an ambitious plan: building an 8-bits computer.<p>At that time I started learning programming and I already knew some HTML and CSS. So we decided to not build a physical computer, but one running in a self-built simulator. I was going to build the simulator, the other guys took care of the computer. \nI was hard, our school hadn&#x27;t taught us anything about computers and programming so we had to learn everything ourselves. Our mentor told us our project was impossible to do, but we didn&#x27;t listen and we worked hard.<p>After a year we did it, I have built the simulator, called BOOLR, and the other guys have built the 8-bits computer, called Tineke.

I have lately been experiencing what I believe to be burnout.[1] After a particularly anxiety-inducing unable-to-focus episode, I spoke with my supervisor about the issue, and he suggested that we make a change with regard to my day-to-day work duties. Since I am a senior at the company, one obvious path is to take on some managerial duties while reducing my programming duties. The main issue with this change is that my department doesn&#x27;t necessarily need a manager at this time (my department has three people including myself, though we&#x27;re trying to hire another person), so moving me to that position would most likely incur more of a drain of company resources (e.g. money). It&#x27;s worth noting that I do not want to leave my company.<p>Questions for someone who has dealt with or is dealing with burnout:\n* Has transitioning to a different set of duties worked for alleviating your symptoms?\n* What would be a good set of duties to transition to from programming?\n* If you also suffer from depression, do you have any method(s) for not letting your depression interfere with work?<p>Questions for someone with experience running &#x2F; managing at a company:\n* Is there a way to transition without putting a significant drain on company resources? I.e. are there any techniques for making a manager position profitable when the position isn&#x27;t otherwise necessary?<p>I realize that answers to most of these questions would require more details about the structure of the company I work for. I&#x27;m really just looking for general tips and&#x2F;or success&#x2F;failure stories from people who may have been in similar situations.<p>[1] As a side note, I do also suffer from major depressive disorder and I take an SSRI for that. The symptoms of burnout used to wax and wane alongside the symptoms of my depression, but the burnout symptoms have lately been growing more cumbersome despite me not feeling overall more depressed than usual.","time":1494440163,"title":"Ask HN: How can I transition after getting

This book explores the very real impact it has: physical harm, emotional harm, and more.<p>We are excited to have John Maeda writing the Foreword to the book, who has been a long supporter of inclusive design.<p>The book is out right now and I made this website for it: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tragicdesign.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tragicdesign.com&#x2F;</a><p>Were excited to finally have this out in the hands of designers, engineers, and others making products, and start making an impact on this important issue.<p>Thanks HN\n- Jonathan","time":1494435166,"title":"Show HN: I wrote a book about Design Ethics called Tragic Design","type":"story"},{"by":"tosh","descendants":2,"id":14309478,"kids":[14309992,14310470],"score":12,"time":1494433628,"title":"Azure goes database crazy with one new NoSQL and two new SQL services","type":"story","url":"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/azure-adds-mysql-postgresql-and-a-way-to-do-cloud-computing-outside-the-cloud/"},{"by":"travisglines","descendants":5,"id":14309243,"kids":[14309814,14309566,14312789,14310008],"score":58,"time":1494432074,"title":"Automated Machine Learning – A Paradigm Shift  Airbnb","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/automated-machine-learning-a-paradigm-shift-that-accelerates-data-scientist-productivity-airbnb-f1f8a10d61f8"},{"by":"dmit","descendants":522,"id":14309194,"kids":[14312980,14313009,14313285,14314848,14314981,14314554,14312872,14313775,14313813,14312942,14315663,14313255,14313007,14316333,14315215,14315084,14314956,14319695,14313336,14313725,14313266,14315317,14312989,14314731,14316012,14315869,14317134,14313712,14313791,14314276,14313778,14315323,14318637,14322274,14314749,14314753,14314384,14315231,14312785,14313398,14320909,14315553,14312759,14314760,14313578,14315686,14315228,14313300,14312904,14315415,14317511,14320544,14315569,14317444,14314939,14312964,14313699,14320644,14315243,14313388,14313233,14314671,14312883,14314139,14313235,14313504,14313505,14313303,14312790,14317935,14320962,14314063],"score":1450,"time":1494431807,"title":"A crashed advertisement reveals logs of a facial recognition system","type":"story","url":"https://twitter.com/GambleLee/status/862307447276544000"},{"by":"mhashemi","descendants":32,"id":14309168,"kids":[14311362,14310533,14312265,14309679,14313247,14309359],"score":144,"time":1494431620,"title":"The Many Layers of Packaging: Why PyPI Isn't an App Store","type":"story","url":"http://sedimental.org/the_packaging_gradient.html"},{"by":"Hooke","descendants":80,"id":14309167,"kids":[14313815,14313013,14313373,14315550,14312458,14315124,14313971,14312897,14317499,14315546,14313628,14316345,14313473,14312413,14312416,14313498],"score":196,"time":1494431598,"title":"Human behavioral complexity peaks at age 25: study","type":"story","url":"http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005408"},{"by":"nwcs","descendants":40,"id":14309071,"kids":[14310414,14310344,14309621,14309868,14310685,14311826,14310028,14311008,14311035,14310149,14310249,14309725,14310336,14310349,14309653],"score":91,"time":1494431117,"title":"Multiple Vulnerabilities in ASUS Routers","type":"story","url":"http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2017/May/24"},{"by":"willyyr","descendants":99,"id":14309089,"kids":[14310403,14310725,14310233,14309918,14313050,14310224,14309866,14309914,14314017,14310111,14313106,14309897,14309900,14310270,14310379,14311783,14310074,14313125,14317189,14313970,14314177],"score":180,"time":1494431176,"title":"Azure Database for MySQL and PostgreSQL","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/10/microsoft-launches-azure-database-for-mysql-and-postgressql/"},{"by":"rmal30","descendants":15,"id":14309209,"kids":[14309498,14339292,14310281,14314216,14310433,14314342,14311124],"score":20,"time":1494431880,"title":"Show HN: Light Flip – A cell inversion puzzle game","type":"story","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rmal30.lightflip&hl=en"},{"by":"gschier","descendants":53,"id":14309143,"kids":[14309265,14310247,14311168,14310686,14315290,14310294,14311624,14309859,14311133,14313719,14309695,14310944],"score":218,"time":1494431515,"title":"Show HN: Insomnia REST Client now open-source","type":"story","url":"https://insomnia.rest/blog/open-source-announcement/"},{"by":"_uy6i","descendants":3,"id":14308881,"kids":[14341148,14308904],"score":2,"text":"Ready to dump gmail and pay for email service.

Not too much into Airbnb unless I am going with a group of people.<p>Then I put this document on a Google Drive or print it out so I can consume this info while I am on my trip.<p>Wondering if other people put in the same effort and what their workflow is.","time":1494260593,"title":"Ask HN: What is your trip planning workflow?","type":"story"},{"by":"bpierre","descendants":17,"id":14293231,"kids":[14295694,14310989,14295787,14297610,14312226,14299227,14296636],"score":89,"time":1494261778,"title":"The Last Survivors of Meridian 59 (2014)","type":"story","url":"http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-last-survivors-of-meridian-59"},{"by":"tzz","descendants":3,"id":14292826,"kids":[14319269,14293297,14293164],"score":1,"time":1494259586,"title":"Ask HN: Where can I get list of all registered .com domain names?","type":"story"},{"by":"endswapper","descendants":2,"id":14292771,"kids":[14293943,14295156],"score":32,"time":1494259334,"title":"John Oliver crashes FCC site","type":"story","url":"http://thehill.com/policy/technology/332342-john-oliver-roasts-the-fccs-plan-to-curb-net-neutrality"},{"by":"DiabloD3","descendants":156,"id":14293186,"kids":[14293909,14294006,14293980,14296349,14296339,14294577,14297867,14294355,14296148,14294881,14295489,14295515,14294286,14296366,14296584,14301424,14296130,14297375,14296368,14298190,14298186],"score":201,"time":1494261488,"title":"There is little research into the long-term effects of using antidepressants","type":"story","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/06/dont-know-who-am-antidepressant-long-term-use"},{"by":"jbk","descendants":47,"id":14292651,"kids":[14297543,14295813,14294466,14293094,14300402,14299055,14299049,14296641,14293262,14293411],"score":155,"time":1494258741,"title":"Google’s “Fuchsia” smartphone OS dumps Linux, has a wild new UI","type":"story","url":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/05/googles-fuchsia-smartphone-os-dumps-linux-has-a-wild-new-ui/"},{"by":"bpierre","descendants":247,"id":14292396,"kids":[14293440,14295288,14296714,14295102,14297133,14293258,14294045,14293827,14292985,14293033,14293144,14293923,14294093,14293949,14293129,14309456,14293908,14292963,14294792,14292810,14296383,14293122,14294155,14297624,14296155,14296211,14297778,14300657,14297776],"score":692,"time":1494257419,"title":"Uncensorable Wikipedia on IPFS","type":"story","url":"https://ipfs.io/blog/24-uncensorable-wikipedia/"},{"by":"bysin","dead":true,"id":14292241,"kids":[14292463,14292471,14292419],"score":7,"time":1494256665,"title":"There's no good reason to use Nodejs","type":"story","url":"http://bysin.net/2017/05/07/no-good-reason-to-use-nodejs/"},{"by":"aaronarduino","descendants":41,"id":14292200,"kids":[14292541,14292399,14294015,14296139,14294931,14293891,14299208,14294197,14292314,14293527,14298036,14294479,14296082,14296537,14294555,14293877,14294824,14293317,14292726],"score":20,"text":"I&#x27;m curious about how much code most people write in a normal working day as a programmer.<p>I am looking into changing careers to become a programmer and want to know how much code one would be expected to write in a day.<p>Example:<p>Profession&#x2F;position: --<p>Code:\n- x amount lines of code &#x2F;

I find large documentation sources good for exploring ideas later, but at first I need to get to compile something, if for nothing else than my own sanity.<p>Thank you in advance for your help :D","time":1494089164,"title":"Ask HN: Looking for the best Phoenix/Elixir/Erlang Tutorials","type":"story"},{"by":"tdwong","descendants":9,"id":14281042,"kids":[14281861,14281748,14281713,14283660,14282474,14281814,14281820],"score":99,"time":1494088796,"title":"Detecting walking speed with wireless signals","type":"story","url":"http://news.mit.edu/2017/dina-katabi-csail-team-develop-wireless-system-to-detect-walking-speeds-0501"},{"by":"programminggeek","descendants":123,"id":14280947,"kids":[14281015,14281089,14281234,14281026,14281125,14282301,14281074,14280995,14281405,14281018,14281321,14281350,14281302,14281009,14281022,14281425,14281014,14281063,14282589,14281117,14281095,14281320,14281433,14281618,14281629,14281033,14282042,14281340,14281013,14281001,14280982,14281368,14281048,14281120,14281167,14286335],"score":75,"time":1494087902,"title":"Why are most programmers white males?","type":"story","url":"http://brianknapp.me/most-programmers-white-males/"},{"by":"bluejekyll","descendants":49,"id":14280709,"kids":[14281266,14281836,14281413,14282365,14281948,14283442,14281524,14281695,14283954],"score":87,"time":1494085321,"title":"Measles outbreak rages after anti-vaccine groups target vulnerable community","type":"story","url":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/05/measles-outbreak-rages-after-anti-vaccine-groups-target-vulnerable-community/"},{"by":"djsumdog","descendants":100,"id":14280713,"kids":[14281400,14281753,14281191,14280887,14281860,14281604,14281285,14281525,14288660,14283862,14283754,14281086,14283084],"score":167,"time":1494085373,"title":"More Android phones than ever are covertly listening for inaudible sounds in ads","type":"story","url":"https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/05/theres-a-spike-in-android-apps-that-covertly-listen-for-inaudible-sounds-in-ads/"},{"by":"uyoakaoma","descendants":19,"id":14280660,"kids":[14281187,14282414,14282406,14282234,14282650,14281768],"score":21,"time":1494084804,"title":"Why Do North Koreans Hate Us?

a high school student who just committed to UIUC for CS. However, I&#x27;m facing a lot of pressure to cancel my decision and switch to UVa CS, which is still apparently possible. UVa invited me to their Rodman scholars program, which offers priority registration and separate dorms. The drastic difference between these two environments is making the decision very stressful for me.\nUIUC has a top 5 CS program and a decent business program, but it&#x27;s lousy at essentially everything else. It has bad weather and a largely unattractive campus.\nUVa has a top business program with a decent computer science program and a solid overall reputation. It has great weather and a beautiful campus.\nBoth are located in the middle of nowhere, are considered party schools, and have similar cost. I wasn&#x27;t in the right state of mind when visiting the schools and didn&#x27;t get a good experience from either. It&#x27;s too late to visit again.\nWhich school would offer better connections? Would the lack of talent in other disciplines at UIUC hinder my intellectual development? How important is the size and strength of the CS department if I&#x27;m confident that I&#x27;ll be able to find jobs regardless?\nIn summation, which school is better for a hacker personality with huge ambitions?

The way Einstein was obsessed with Physics took me to my childhood days when I used to ponder over why everything is the way it is. I always wanted to become a physicist. But being an Indian, I was repeatedly bombarded with the idea how essential it is to make a living. As such, I strayed from what I wanted to do and got into engineering (CS). It&#x27;s now the end of my engineering and I am now occupied with the thoughts of what my life had been if I would have chosen the road not taken. It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t have a good job, but the thought of losing a chance to do something I love that keeps me awake these days. Personally, I think that the advancement in technology is also responsible for this. The internet, though providing us the means to access a vast amount of information, has also taken from us our ability to question things. Rather than thinking of the solutions on our own with our imagination, we now resort to Googling stuff and finding the answers straightaway.","time":1493679818,"title":"Ask HN: Are you doing what you want to do or what you have to?","type":"story"},{"by":"nfriedly","descendants":4,"id":14242550,"kids":[14244630,14242561,14242853],"score":3,"time":1493679686,"title":"Show HN: Give someone a link, see their User Agent","type":"story","url":"http://www.user-agent.io/host"},{"by":"tptacek","descendants":33,"id":14242508,"kids":[14243142,14243050,14244579,14243676,14259249],"score":222,"time":1493679367,"title":"Intel's Remote AMT Vulnerability","type":"story","url":"http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/48429.html"},{"by":"klibertp","descendants":9,"id":14242481,"kids":[14244305,14257614,14244403],"score":67,"time":1493679119,"title":"Meta-syntactic programming with Racket: string interpolation","type":"story","url":"https://klibert.pl/posts/adding_string_interpolation_to_racket.html"},{"by":"taylorbuley","descendants":113,"id":14242265,"kids":[14242647,14242617,14243183,14242574,14243759,14242486,14243615,14242749,14242970,14242987,14244498,14243178,14244264,14244021,14243904,14243768,14243824,14244109,14243698,14242820,14243807,14244113,14243120,14243214,14242781],"score":134,"time":1493677323,"title":"The Leaked Fyre Festival Pitch Deck Is Beyond Parody","type":"story","url":"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/05/fyre-festival-pitch-deck"},{"by":"lkurtz","dead":true,"id":14242180,"kids":[14242366,14242364,14242270,14242336,14242377,14242349,14242321,14242403,14242369,14242293],"score":125,"time":1493676670,"title":"Sean Spicer Tweeted a Bitcoin Address – Not His Password","type":"story","url":"https://patribotics.blog/2017/05/01/exclusive-sean-spicer-tweeted-a-bitcoin-address-not-his-password/"},{"by":"a3n","descendants":9,"id":14242157,"kids":[14253558,14247219,14249964,14242304,14247247,14243708,14247991,14253266,14243922],"score":5,"text":"Mine is currently The Unix Programming Environment, Kernighan &amp; Pike, 1984. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Unix_Programming_Environment<p>(Ahh ... blue on white book covers.)<p>It&#x27;s a pretty good substitute for Unix Power Tools, although obviously much less coverage, but a great intro.<p>It&#x27;s also dated, so I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone new as <i>the</i> book they should read (but back in the day I would have).

This is all very new to me, so I&#x27;d really appreciate some help here :)<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;adtac&#x2F;commento","time":1493641262,"title":"Ask HN: Is an open source SaaS model viable?","type":"story"},{"by":"mess110","descendants":27,"id":14236945,"kids":[14237691,14237609,14238067,14237830,14237912,14237529,14238267],"score":30,"time":1493640612,"title":"Show HN: /r/place backed by the Bitcoin blockchain","type":"story","url":"https://mess110.github.io/blog/cryptoplace/"},{"by":"geekmissile","dead":true,"id":14237039,"kids":[14237369,14237577],"score":8,"time":1493642234,"title":"Petition: Squarespace – Stop Hosting Hate Sites That Violate Acceptable Use","type":"story","url":"https://www.change.org/p/squarespace-stop-hosting-white-supremacists"},{"by":"romanhotsiy","descendants":108,"id":14236850,"kids":[14239762,14237705,14237569,14237002,14239446,14237107,14237095,14239248,14240690,14243568,14239990,14238284,14237261,14238646,14238293,14237066,14237031],"score":289,"time":1493638916,"title":"SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage has landed at LZ-1 [video]","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzQpkQ1etdA"},{"by":"_iostreamer_","descendants":38,"id":14236830,"kids":[14238178,14237024,14240275,14237318,14240022,14240696,14238090,14237802,14237872,14237247],"score":141,"time":1493638589,"title":"FuncShell – A Haskell-based alternative to awk","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/iostreamer-X/FuncShell"},{"by":"mathgenius","descendants":34,"id":14236728,"kids":[14237129,14236981,14236888,14238919,14236929,14240292,14237173,14237294,14237434],"score":98,"time":1493636893,"title":"Springer retracting 107 papers published in Tumor Biology with fake peer reviews","type":"story","url":"http://retractionwatch.com/2017/04/20/new-record-major-publisher-retracting-100-studies-cancer-journal-fake-peer-reviews/"},{"by":"tomhoward","descendants":117,"id":14236711,"kids":[14238664,14239835,14238212,14244440,14237823,14237592,14238401,14238870,14238399,14240046,14243385,14240987,14240282,14241089,14239961,14240909,14246775,14237581,14237378,14239403],"score":388,"time":1493636675,"title":"Y Combinator When No One Cared","type":"story","url":"http://foundersatwork.posthaven.com/y-combinator-when-no-one-cared"},{"by":"desaiguddu","dead":true,"id":14236538,"kids":[14237151,14237055,14237279],"score":6,"time":1493633485,"title":"Show HN: AppFixers – Convert 32 bit iOS apps to 64-bit Apps","type":"story","url":"https://www.app-fixers.com/"},{"by":"_6cj7","descendants":17,"id":14236541,"kids":[14242523,14240387,14240344,14240190,14241825,14242338],"score":178,"time":1493633613,"title":"Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra Through Computer Science Applications","type":"story","url":"http://codingthematrix.com/"},{"by":"Madawar","descendants":4,"id":14236523,"kids":[14236531,14236622,14237213],"score":2,"time":1493633200,"title":"Show HN: Dakika – A Minute Taking app","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/Madawar/Dakika"},{"by":"jeffwass","descendants":11,"id":14236497,"kids":[14237381,14237767,14237664,14240146,14241926,14251080],"score":45,"time":1493632631,"title":"The woman with a strange 'second sight'","type":"story","url":"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170428-i-have-a-strange-second-sight"},{"by":"hammadnasir","descendants":5,"id":14236603,"kids":[14236677,14238209,14236731],"score":2,"text":"Introducing Repairer -

Unfortunately I am a terrible designer and so I&#x27;ve basically just used a library called spectre.css and only modified a few css classes (like giving buttons different colors, etc.).<p>I&#x27;m about 70% or so done with core functionality, but each time I look at my prototype I can&#x27;t help but feel like... man, this looks so basic!  I have been doing this for only a few months now, and I don&#x27;t really have many colleagues who know this stuff (I&#x27;m not a engineer or smart guy like that - just decided to change my career path lol and I&#x27;m enjoying building stuff).<p>Question for you smart people out there who have built any web sites or web applications.  Did you end up finding a partner who is good at UI design to help you once you had your core functionality down?

Search as a Service, Queue as a Service, Log-aggregation as a Service, etc... are very popular.  I was wondering if a Data Grid as a service would be an interesting product to anyone.  A data grid is an in memory data store that scales fairly well horizontally (there are a few open source solutions) and lets you join multiple &quot;tables&quot; to query seamlessly.  The idea is that as you build out your application and system, you have more and more services and data sources.  Exposing all of these to the clients quickly is complicated, you can build services that aggregate other services but that can be slow &#x2F; hard to manage.  You can shove everything into Redshift, Athena, or bigtable, but those are mostly for data warehouse uses and the querying isn&#x27;t that fast.  With a data grid as a service, you pipe your various datas into it via some queue (SQS, Kafka, etc..) or REST calls and then make queries to the data grid directly to retrieve data.  It&#x27;s kind of a cacheing layer on top of whatever infrastructure you currently have but allows multiple sources to be merged.<p>Is this a useful product?","time":1493408185,"title":"Ask HN: Data Grid as a Service?","type":"story"},{"by":"Dnguyen","descendants":5,"id":14222251,"kids":[14223673,14222972,14222348,14224027],"score":12,"time":1493407051,"title":"Musk Teases Tesla Simi","type":"story","url":"https://electrek.co/2017/04/28/tesla-semi-elon-musk-teaser-image-all-electric-truck/"},{"by":"leonagano","descendants":7,"id":14222219,"kids":[14227045,14229460,14222340,14227491,14224593],"score":8,"time":1493406800,"title":"Ask HN: What are the most impressive offices you have ever been to/worked from?","type":"story"},{"by":"walterbell","descendants":4,"id":14222364,"kids":[14222589,14222635,14224453],"score":17,"time":1493407919,"title":"Comments on Consolidated Tape Association Plan/Consolidated Quotation Plan","type":"story","url":"https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-ctacq-2017-02/ctacq201702.htm"},{"by":"craigkerstiens","descendants":21,"id":14222823,"kids":[14225505,14223310,14223622,14225080],"score":192,"time":1493411520,"title":"Postgres tips for Rails developers","type":"story","url":"https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2017/04/28/postgres-tips-for-rails/"},{"by":"user101010101","descendants":4,"id":14222071,"kids":[14222182,14240092],"score":3,"text":"Not just building things when there are commits but running backups, enabling ChatOps, etc. Is it currently up to the task?

As a result, I feel I lack in expertise about devops that I should know as an engineer. Sideprojects of mine end up going on PaaS services like Heroku or Zeit and I don&#x27;t really learn what it means to set up a server.<p>For instance, I could tell you that you likely have a load balancer (like nginx) which you can use to point routes to different services, and I know that services are going to be things like node instances running my code; but everything I know is fairly superficial and lacking in depth. What is the best way to share secrets? Is there a standard way of having your load balancer know what services to feed to? How does a load balancer that defines routes work with a rails or express instance that also defines routes? Should all my services be built on vagrant, or has docker made that less useful?<p>I&#x27;ve been having trouble filling in these gaps in deep understanding because it seems like every setup is different, so cribbing from convention is not really possible -- and then I read a litany of stories of setups that are wrong in some way and that feeds in to this paralysis of not wanting to do things wrong.<p>I tried setting up a Kubernetes cluster along with Deis, but there are <i>so many layers</i> of different&#x2F;new services that I don&#x27;t know how to conceptually tie those back to a broader understanding. For instance, K8s has a load balancer &#x27;Ingress&#x27; -- does this negate the need for nginx? But then Deis installed its own load balancer so now I have two low balancers for zero services. It&#x27;s just confusing because the big picture is obscured by the novelty of everyones setup.<p>Thank you in advance for your help.","time":1493333940,"title":"Ask HN: Best resource for learning devops as an engineer (js/ruby)?","type":"story"},{"by":"awinter-py","descendants":179,"id":14215616,"kids":[14216920,14216115,14216299,14216375,14216284,14216018,14216418,14219256,14216998,14217942,14216626,14216251,14216567,14216612,14216339,14216244,14216404,14217917,14215903,14219140,14216453,14220009,14216475,14216776,14216222,14216238,14216229,14217364,14297511,14216878,14217100,14216359,14216147,14218696,14216434,14216494,14217471],"score":334,"time":1493334611,"title":"Instead of containers, give me strong config and deploy primitives","type":"story","url":"https://abe-winter.github.io/blues/2017/04/27/config-vs-containers.html"},{"by":"bernardom","descendants":5,"id":14215450,"kids":[14215637,14215694,14215775],"score":2,"text":"MySQLWorkbench is nice, but crashes a lot and isn&#x27;t very customizable (for example, there&#x27;s no way to do light-font-on-dark-screen). \nSequel Pro is nicer in that regard, but it doesn&#x27;t support multi-tab within the same connection and further &quot;doesn&#x27;t regard itself as a query editor.&quot; \nThere&#x27;s no save-as selection on the menu.

A little over a year ago I moved to NYC to attend a Full Stack Python Coding Bootcamp. I flew through the course, and upon finishing had bright eyes and a lot of enthusiasm to begin a career in tech. The teachers threw their support behind me, and let me know that I was a strong developer (and more importantly a fast learner) and should have no problem finding a job. Fast forward to now - I have been looking for a career full time since July 2016 with no luck. I’ve been interviewing a lot, but ultimately get passed over for people with more experience. I’m going into debt at this point, and don’t know where to turn or what to do to get my shot.<p>I know companies here are really pressing a CS degree - which I don’t have. I do have a BS in Petroleum Engineer, and have work experience as an engineer. I also managed a Oil &amp; Gas service company in Africa for years before making this transition, so I have quality professional experience. I left my career to embark on this journey into technology, so I have proof of my passion and commitment to this change. I’m not sure where to turn or what to do at this point, but I know I want to be working in tech.<p>I have been a finalist for many jobs, but no offers to date. Some companies are great about going in another direction and giving feedback, and other companies give me none. Last month I interviewed at Foursquare - two phone interviews, a project, two more in person interviews - wait two weeks and receive a generic email (“While we felt your experience was great, it didn&#x27;t quite align with what we&#x27;re looking for at this time.”). I’ve sent emails asking for more feedback and received no replies.<p>If you have any thoughts as to what I can to do get my first job in technology, I would be grateful.","time":1493304841,"title":"Ask HN: I'm lost in my journey to become a developer","type":"story"},{"by":"hamid914","descendants":0,"id":14211895,"kids":[14211917,14211919],"score":1,"time":1493304635,"title":"How to use telnet to test ssl/https websites – Bearfruit","type":"story","url":"https://www.bearfruit.org/2008/04/17/telnet-for-testing-ssl-https-websites/"},{"by":"tuananh","descendants":62,"id":14211878,"kids":[14212492,14212551,14212201,14212789,14212563,14212178,14212885,14214490,14212484,14212287,14212896,14212447,14212343,14212886,14213593,14212767,14213594],"score":42,"time":1493304504,"title":"SourceTree for Windows 2.0","type":"story","url":"https://blog.sourcetreeapp.com/2017/04/27/sourcetree-for-windows-2-0-new-ui-faster-performance-and-microsoft-git-virtual-file-system-support/"},{"by":"AliCollins","descendants":8,"id":14212011,"kids":[14212336,14212297,14213590,14213579],"score":19,"time":1493305335,"title":"Why I Stopped Hustling","type":"story","url":"https://www.groovehq.com/blog/knocking-the-hustle"},{"by":"desperado","descendants":7,"id":14211854,"kids":[14213264,14211961,14212599],"score":4,"text":"Hey guys and girls ;)<p>I&#x27;m at my wits end, and need advice.

There are functioning Plastc Cards, which were demonstrated to our investors and our backers, and the capital was to be allocated for the mass production and shipping of Plastc Cards to pre-order customers. At first, the principal investment group postponed their investment and a couple of weeks later the round fell apart.<p>After the initial funding was unavailable, Plastc made progress with another investor who offered $6.75 million. This deal was scheduled to close last week and would propel development across the finish line, as well as allow for Plastc Card pre-orders to be shipped and for production to continue into a retail phase.<p>However, once again at the very last minute, our investor gave us notice that they have decided rescind their investment offer. The round was a signature away from closing and we were extremely caught off guard when they notified us yesterday they were backing out. Our existing investors kept us alive and functioning as long as they could during this fundraising process, but in the end, we needed new outside capital to get into production.<p>[..abridged..] see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plastc.com&#x2F; for full copy","time":1492717406,"title":"Plastc may file bankruptcy and will cease operations April 20, 2017","type":"story"},{"by":"miraj","descendants":222,"id":14160053,"kids":[14160742,14160514,14160470,14160749,14160784,14160898,14160356,14160867,14161325,14160557,14160499,14160622,14160372,14161656,14160855,14160261,14161102,14160931,14160366,14161125,14163843,14167063,14164696,14169450,14167138,14189806,14164396,14160848,14161772],"score":171,"time":1492717001,"title":"Canada is North America’s up-and-coming startup center","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/20/canada-is-north-americas-up-and-coming-startup-center/"},{"by":"obi1kenobi","descendants":2,"id":14160113,"kids":[14160380,14160125],"score":2,"time":1492717359,"title":"How does Python's super() work with multiple inheritance?","type":"story","url":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3277367/how-does-pythons-super-work-with-multiple-inheritance"},{"by":"smacktoward","descendants":136,"id":14159904,"kids":[14160775,14160207,14160281,14160266,14160448,14160186,14160438,14160482,14160504,14160690,14160747,14160760,14160453,14160010,14160709,14163168,14161738],"score":108,"time":1492715855,"title":"The Nightmare Scenario for Florida’s Coastal Homeowners","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-04-19/the-nightmare-scenario-for-florida-s-coastal-homeowners"},{"by":"cevian","descendants":17,"id":14159874,"kids":[14168733,14160230,14159914,14160618,14159973],"score":28,"time":1492715697,"title":"Time-series data: Why (and how) to use a relational database instead of NoSQL","type":"story","url":"https://blog.timescale.com/time-series-data-why-and-how-to-use-a-relational-database-instead-of-nosql-d0cd6975e87c"},{"by":"jedberg","descendants":162,"id":14159963,"kids":[14160187,14160391,14160146,14160665,14161406,14161552,14160048,14160738,14160967,14163464,14160267,14167321,14162159,14161416,14164543,14179102,14161777,14164412,14162367,14165563,14161432,14161095,14160249,14161523],"score":130,"time":1492716288,"title":"Plastc will cease operations and will not fulfill any pre-orders","type":"story","url":"https://plastc.com/"},{"by":"DrBobDengler","descendants":9,"id":14159675,"kids":[14160520,14159847,14159863,14159693],"score":2,"text":"Question: What do I say to a developer to explain that I want someone to rewrite my PC Desktop application code (.Net&#x2F;C++) into a web-based, platform independent version that won&#x27;t cost $100K everytime Windows&#x2F;Word&#x2F;SQL unleash a new update?

Mostly from Mexico, Colombia, etc etc. Google Analytics really doesn&#x27;t show a definitive &quot;referrer zero&quot;, and can&#x27;t find any publications online mentioning it. So we have no idea what happened. Our best guess is radio, tv or just word of mouth.<p>We don&#x27;t have any ads, we do have an iOS app that is paid and also just launched a venture into a &quot;SaaS&quot; model.<p>However: we have received absolutely zero extra revenue from this event. Also the buzz on our Facebook page is pretty much none-existent. Usually when the site gets attention we at least get some e-mails from users about how cool it was etc. I have received nothing. And if it weren&#x27;t for pingdom saying that we&#x27;re intermittently down, I would not have noticed myself.<p>I&#x27;m having a hard time figuring out if it&#x27;s due to the traffic being bogus or just simply cultural differences.

And as ad networks go it seems to be the only one that isn&#x27;t 100% a scam and people actually use.

People sign up to a course, get a partner assigned, they agree on recurring meeting times, and they meet always at the same time to work on a project (e.g. they build a REST API doing remote pair programming). The &quot;recurring&quot; part is the key since this is what reduces dropouts (i.e. you have a person holding you accountable).<p>Problem: it&#x27;s incredibly hard to help two people agree on a recurring meeting schedule when you don&#x27;t have a large number of users.<p>Imperfect solution #1: People sign up to a pre-defined schedule (e.g. Tue &amp; Thu 6pm - 9pm). This lacks flexibility and it doesn&#x27;t work well with multiple time zones.<p>Imperfect solution #2: You ask people for timezone and how many times per week they want to meet and you assign them to someone in a similar timezone and let them agree on meeting times via email. This requires a lot of back and forth via email, some people are not super responsive, etc. This is very flexible and maximizes the chances of people agreeing on a meeting time.<p>Imperfect solution #3: People sign up and select meeting preferences (number of days per week, preferred days, preferred times, etc.) and, using an algorithm, you match people with similar preferences. This lacks some flexibility because someone people might be open to times other than the &quot;ideal&quot; ones they have selected. This also works really week with scale, but not so well with less than 100 users per course.<p>Imperfect solution #3.1: Same as the previous one, but you show users &quot;schedule preferences&quot; of available users so they can select them and they get assigned to that person automatically.<p>What would you do to maximize the chances of getting two people to agree on recurring meeting times and to reduce the back and forth in the conversation at the same time?","time":1492112289,"title":"Ask HN: What's the best way to help 2 people agree on a recurring meeting time?","type":"story"},{"by":"computator","descendants":3,"id":14110255,"kids":[14112695,14111859],"score":40,"time":1492112163,"title":"Patent Owner Can’t Use Foreign Court Order To Block EFF From Speaking Out","type":"story","url":"https://supporters.eff.org/civicrm/mailing/view?reset=1&id=2097"},{"by":"hammadnasir","descendants":40,"id":14110218,"kids":[14110780,14110392,14110416,14111066,14112727,14110753,14110577,14110664,14111091,14110895,14110290],"score":42,"text":"Would love to have your feedback on my startup named Sportal - it helps you find players in your locality for playing any sport you want.<p>Here&#x27;s the link to the app: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.getsportalapp.sportal&amp;hl=en","time":1492111913,"title":"Ask HN: Review my startup","type":"story"},{"by":"craigcannon","descendants":107,"id":14110112,"kids":[14112556,14112031,14112440,14112411,14111971,14112019,14113979,14114403,14112404,14116240,14112049,14114184,14112239,14114143,14112004,14114063,14112231,14112144,14112121,14112681],"score":154,"time":1492111197,"title":"Walking in L.A.","type":"story","url":"http://www.walkinginla.com/"},{"by":"campuscodi","descendants":1,"id":14110143,"kids":[14110203,14110211],"score":2,"time":1492111423,"title":"Former Sysadmin Accused of Planting “Time Bomb” in Company's Database","type":"story","url":"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/former-sysadmin-accused-of-planting-time-bomb-in-companys-database/"},{"by":"amerf1","descendants":4,"id":14109918,"kids":[14110071,14110030,14109978],"score":2,"text":"Just curious to know what you would do&#x2F;build if you only had $70 in your account","time":1492109937,"title":"Ask HN: What would you build with $70?","type":"story"},{"by":"ralphmender","descendants":26,"id":14109905,"kids":[14112283,14111519,14111751,14112225,14113333,14114293,14111769,14113645,14114645,14111853,14113119,14120581,14113324,14111449],"score":88,"time":1492109840,"title":"Embedded developers need an open source OTA software updater without the lock-in","type":"story","url":"http://embedded-computing.com/guest-blogs/embedded-developers-need-an-open-source-over-the-air-software-updater-without-the-lock-in/"},{"by":"antortl","descendants":2,"id":14109742,"kids":[14110335,14115515],"score":2,"time":1492108718,"title":"Ludwig – Clarify your thoughts in English","type":"story","url":"https://ludwig.guru/"},{"by":"happy-go-lucky","descendants":3,"id":14109745,"kids":[14109889,14121865],"score":3,"time":1492108748,"title":"How to spot a lying job candidate","type":"story","url":"http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20170411-how-to-catch-the-lying-job-applicants-and-what-to-do-next"},{"by":"eklavyaa","descendants":3,"id":14109595,"kids":[14110740,14113442],"score":6,"text":"I am software developer having 6 years of professional experience.

Startups want to get early adopters and beta testers to help provide feedback for validating their own projects. My understanding is that there could never be too many platforms like that as long as they are quality platforms and not just a list of projects. It is my understanding that these platforms are around to not only help the public find the new projects but to help the companies behind those projects acquire those early adopters and beta testers.<p>Rather than build a basic MVP I figured I should include what I thought is great about the platforms. As I have already begun doing that I am wondering what users of those platforms, or their developers, wish the platforms had that they currently do not have, or that they did not have of which they currently do.<p>I have been tasked with validating my project to &quot;potential customers&quot;. As my project, and the other platforms in consideration, offer freely the ability to submit content by users of the platforms I am unsure how to validate it any other way than to seek who would use the platform. Imagine it as a mix of the three platforms in consideration, essentially the features you may see similarly among the three platforms.<p>Do you currently use any or all of the three platforms in consideration?

The contest ended without choosing the winner so the payment was supposed to be automatically shared between the top entries. As I was the only one person who had the top entries the guaranteed price of 429 dollars was supposed to be paid on my account. So far all was clear....But yesterday I check my account and discovered there are only 171 dollars paid. I was surprised and angry of course...And ask the support. Here is the answer. I also send screenshots I saved because I am doing this always since I hear freelancer is a scum...Now I have a proof. So here comes the answer&quot;\nThe prize of contest &#x27;Help Quality Comix with a new print or packaging design&#x27; with ID 925778 is 190 USD. There was an technical error on the prize that can be seen on page. It was fixed now. Let me also inform you that there is 19 USD contest fee that was charged to your account. This is why you only got 171 USD only. You can check your Freelancer.com Transaction History for verification.&quot; The contest duration was about two months so they want to tell me the price was not real all the time other designers were uploading their entries? So they claim that you can not be even sure that the price that the employee offer is real? It is only a numbers...Who cares if it was 100 or 10 dollars...Just take the money and shut up...You should be lucky that you get paid anything...How it is possible? Technical error with price? Sorry I do not believe. For me it looks like a froud. I try to contact the CEO owner but I do not think someone who got billions of dollars would ever care about some hundred dollars his company should pay...","time":1492069763,"title":"Freelancer is cheating on you","type":"story"},{"by":"SamPiggott","descendants":0,"id":14104987,"kids":[14107629,14107628],"score":1,"time":1492069932,"title":"Show HN: How we used iBeacons and Sonos to give our studio WWE-style entrances","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/combo-fm/how-we-gave-our-studio-wwe-style-entrances-using-ibeacons-and-sonos-92dd2f54983"},{"by":"nevatiaritika","descendants":28,"id":14104903,"kids":[14111652,14111230,14111478,14111832,14111943,14112443,14111594,14111661,14111526,14114343],"score":56,"time":1492068889,"title":"Gut Driven Development","type":"story","url":"http://kevinmahoney.co.uk/articles/gut-driven-development/"},{"by":"kristianp","descendants":2,"id":14104764,"kids":[14104814,14105426,14107559],"score":3,"time":1492067156,"title":"Microsoft Edge Beats Chrome by Over Three Hours in New Battery Usage Test","type":"story","url":"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/software/microsoft-edge-beats-chrome-by-over-three-hours-in-new-battery-usage-test/"},{"by":"malikNF","descendants":2,"id":14104678,"kids":[14104721,14104703,14104720],"score":2,"time":1492065961,"title":"Ask HN: What are some sites you wish would improve their UI?

During my interview I shared my goals with the cofounders of wanting to move into management and hopefully become the CTO one day. The cofounders said they&#x27;d love nothing more than to see that happen, and agreed that I&#x27;d be the most suitable candidate for the job since I&#x27;ll pretty much be designing the entire system. Shortly after joining we got into an accelerator.<p>3 months go by, 2 weeks after our release I heard my CEO chat about how he asked one of our advisors to join as the CTO. When I asked him wondering, he said that VC firms were pressuring them to get an experienced CTO.<p>I had no issue with accepting the fact that I am not experienced enough to be a CTO. But I felt used and hurt because my CEO knew that fact from the beginning, and didn&#x27;t tell me a thing. The only reason I found out about the whole situation was because I was around when he was having that conversation.<p>During my conversation with the CEO he said they weren&#x27;t concerned with getting a CTO at the moment but much more focused on getting more engineers since the other engineer and I pretty much can&#x27;t pull 18 hour days anymore.<p>2 weeks after my conversation with the CEO, I met one of the cofounders friends who later I find out was in consideration for the CTO position.<p>Today my CEO was telling me about how it looks like that friend is probably joining as the CTO.<p>I spoke to my mentor and others. Everyone told me to take this opportunity to learn from someone great. But I can&#x27;t help but feel angry because the cofounders say one thing, and another thing happens.<p>EDIT:I&#x27;m feeling very unmotivated, and pretty depressed. I feel like I failed, and I have no goals to work for.

Maybe the glut of bootcamp graduates is making it harder for me to stay relevant? I am okay with working in one of the bigger but non-sexy places if they are the easier places to get in. So what are some places in the Chicago area that:<p>* Don&#x27;t care what tech stack you&#x27;ve used<p>* Have a large enough tech team to tolerate a greater ramp-up time for new hires<p>* Years in the field mean less to them, because they can just hire and place someone where it&#x27;s appropriate<p>So where to begin changing my approach so I get higher yields for interviews, and offers?","time":1492037847,"title":"Ask HN: Unemployed for 2 years, looking to find a steady programming job","type":"story"},{"by":"pera","descendants":7,"id":14102613,"kids":[14103125,14104290,14104038,14103814],"score":16,"time":1492038802,"title":"TCP/IP headers leak info about what you're watching on Netflix","type":"story","url":"https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/04/12/breaking_bad_privacy_protection_boffin_beats_netflix_https/"},{"by":"mark_l_watson","descendants":2,"id":14102495,"kids":[14102511,14102814],"score":2,"time":1492037581,"title":"The Dark Secret at the Heart of AI","type":"story","url":"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/604087/the-dark-secret-at-the-heart-of-ai/"},{"by":"xs","descendants":12,"id":14102454,"kids":[14102621,14102998,14104597,14102657,14104064,14107287,14102594,14102623,14104065],"score":11,"text":"I&#x27;ve just completed a project that is ready for public consumption, but not yet ready for mass market consumption.

I.e.:<p>- user&#x2F;tenant management. Oauth + email&#x2F;password, 2-factor, mail&#x2F;sms flows for reset, etc. \n- plan&#x2F;package management + RBAC &#x2F; access control + rate limiting and&#x2F;or overcharges on pay-per-use basis\n- connection to payment provider(s). Say Stripe + Paypal for pretty good coverage. Needs to cover correct VAT handling\n- exposed self-service userprofile &#x2F; saas-preferences &#x2F; payment options &#x2F; billing statements &#x2F; &#x27;currently accrued this month&#x27; statement, etc. \n  - might be API only. Community will take it from there with canned Gui templates using bootstrap, etc. \n- ...<p>Auth0 for instance tackles the user-management space pretty nicely, and it might make sense for this Saas-for-Saas to optionally outsource that part to them for all the extra stuff they provide (LDAP, etc). However, just as an example using multiple users under 1 tenant-account is not straightforward.<p>So why is it that such a Saas-for-Saas doesn&#x27;t exist? Do startups hesitate to outsource this core-functionality? Do they just wing it, and later pull their hair out when realising that doing it properly takes far more time than anticipated?

I browsed Google Shopping [2] but didn&#x27;t purchase one.<p>Later I went into work where Facebook displayed an ad for the instrument in its &quot;sponsored&quot; section and an inline &quot;suggested post&quot; for a manufacturer.<p>My home and work computers and networks are completely different. I typically use incognito mode and &quot;do not track&quot; in Firefox or Chrome. I sign out of all social media and Gmail. Yesterday I was working in a large building with tens of people all using wifi used by hundreds of people across several buildings.<p>I assume no outright nefarious activity, such as an illicit pipe of potential customer IDs between Fb and Google.<p>The best I can theorise is that I had an open Fb window at home, and one of the instrument manufacturers&#x27; websites had an embedded Facebook like button or similar tracker, and they are running targeted ads on Fb. But is this direct-to-an-individual targetting even possible on Fb? Perhaps the obscurity of the instrument meant that I was very likely to see an ad, and very likely to notice it.<p>I typically close Fb when I&#x27;m not using it, so this doesn&#x27;t immediately feel like what happened. I&#x27;ll be doubly-sure to close and log-out Fb now.<p>I can&#x27;t think of other ways that my Google activity could get to Fb. Browser fingerprinting, cellphone location etc would allow Fb to understand my location, but I can&#x27;t see how they&#x27;d match this against Google activity.<p>I&#x27;d be very interested to read how this is, or could be, achieved.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14094083<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;shopping","time":1492002278,"title":"Ask HN: How was this ad targeted to me?","type":"story"},{"by":"mikeywaites","descendants":57,"id":14096982,"kids":[14097349,14099280,14097937,14101649,14098073,14097091,14097115,14097098,14100957,14097130,14104883,14102033,14098612],"score":136,"time":1492000452,"title":"Show HN: Kim – A Python serialization and marshaling framework","type":"story","url":"http://kim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"},{"by":"nnx","descendants":2,"id":14096887,"kids":[14096941,14096939],"score":11,"time":1491999612,"title":"How United Onboards New Users","type":"story","url":"http://www.useronboard.com/how-united-onboards-new-users/"},{"by":"sihaelov","descendants":23,"id":14097011,"kids":[14097603,14097799,14098922,14097358,14099640,14098669,14097855,14101122,14097365,14104719,14098153,14099201,14101438,14097037],"score":214,"time":1492000641,"title":"Show HN: A directory of the best free resources for remote workers and nomads","type":"story","url":"http://remotestash.co"},{"by":"kiyanwang","descendants":1,"id":14096694,"kids":[14105600,14105601],"score":1,"time":1491997357,"title":"Netflix JavaScript Talks – Real-Time Insights Powered by Reactive Programming","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uODxUJ5Jwis"},{"by":"davidiach","descendants":49,"id":14096814,"kids":[14097265,14097326,14097204,14097919,14097893,14097696,14096858,14098039,14099033,14098158,14098228,14097127,14098086,14097300,14098903,14097512,14099001,14097270,14097431,14097174],"score":37,"time":1491998909,"title":"The endgame for cameras is having no camera at all","type":"story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/12/15267486/photography-machine-learning-future"},{"by":"choojoy","descendants":111,"id":14096625,"kids":[14099041,14098267,14099157,14100467,14097977,14099287,14099574,14098259,14098907,14101816,14099193],"score":305,"text":"Dmitry Bogatov was arrested on the 6th of April: he became part of the big penal case initiated by Russia’s Investigation Committee on &quot;incitations to mass riots&quot; during the protest action that took place on the 2nd of April in Moscow. According to the Investigation Committee, Bogatov was publishing messages on the forum sysadmin.ru, inciting to violent actions, for example, &quot;he&quot; was suggesting to bring to the Red Square &quot;bottles, fabric, gasoline, turpentine, foam plastic&quot;. According to the Investigation, the experts had analyzed the text of these messages and proved a &quot;linguistic and psychological characteristics of incitations to terrorism&quot;. However, Dmitry claims that he has nothing to do with posting the incendiary messages.<p>Dmitry Bogatov, 25 years old, teaches maths in MFUA (Moscow Finance and Law University) was a free and open source software activist (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sinsekvu.github.io&#x2F;pages&#x2F;about.html). Dmitry was administrating a Tor exit node (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;atlas.torproject.org&#x2F;#details&#x2F;2402CD5A0D848D1DCA61EB708CC1FBD4364AB8AE) from his house. In fact, the author of &quot;incendiary messages&quot; (called &quot;Airat Bashirov&quot;) was using Tor, and, by lack of chance, he used the ip adress of Dmitry&#x27;s exit node.<p>Dmitry&#x27;s lawyer, Alexei Teptsov, presented videos from surveillance cameras, that proved that, during the moments when the &quot;incendiary messages&quot; were posted, Dmitry was away from his computer. He was coming back from a fitness center with his wife, Tatiana, a genetician, and then went to a supermarket, where cameras were also working.

Other co-workers received 50k to 100k stock options after acquisition, I was left with 5k.<p>Later, founder became serial entrepreneur and started another companies.

There have been a number of &quot;Ask HN&quot; topics about this, but this one is a little different - I am not looking for a brand-new, top-end machine, but rather something to use alongside my MacBook Pro (which runs macOS and Windows via Boot Camp). My budget for this machine is only around $300.<p>If I spend the money on another MacBook (Air or 13&quot; Pro) I am probably looking at a machine of 2011&#x2F;2012 vintage. Unfortunately I&#x27;m not sure the Air machines will be sufficiently powerful for my needs (low-voltage CPUs, only 4GB non-upgradable RAM). Also, all of the the pre-retina MacBooks seem to be let down by their screens: glossy, TN panels with (except for the 13&quot; Air) at most 800 vertical pixels.<p>Another option is a Lenovo ThinkPad, again probably from around 2012 (with the traditional 7-row ThinkPad keyboard). The ThinkPad X220 seems good, but is let down by its poor quality &quot;clickpad&quot; and, again, poor screen resolution (but at least IPS is an option). The T420s has a more traditional ThinkPad trackpad and better screen resolution, but no IPS and inferior battery life.<p>So, all of these machines have downsides. For my needs, I think the T420s is probably the best compromise.<p>Would you recommend (for or against) a ThinkPad T420s for use with Linux?<p>Is there another machine available for around $300 that I should consider?","time":1491915015,"title":"Ask HN: Best budget Linux laptop for a developer?","type":"story"},{"by":"ColinWright","descendants":321,"id":14087079,"kids":[14088263,14088182,14088207,14087857,14087430,14088008,14088869,14087506,14087334,14088238,14087720,14088588,14087578,14087827,14087248,14088277,14087930,14087545,14088149,14087809,14094013,14090717,14088652,14087489,14087451,14091274,14088999,14088189,14088560,14087860,14088316,14087682,14087236,14087801,14088502,14087302,14088252,14087351,14087748,14090368,14088314,14087574,14090156,14088105,14088113,14088120,14087577,14087284],"score":433,"time":1491914129,"title":"Twitter allegedly deleting negative tweets about United Airlines incident","type":"story","url":"https://thenextweb.com/twitter/2017/04/11/twitter-delete-united-airlines-tweets/#.tnw_NIWU4Eup"},{"by":"DorothySim","descendants":19,"id":14087086,"kids":[14087510,14087228,14087555],"score":17,"time":1491914220,"title":"Secure Remote Password protocol","type":"story","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol"},{"by":"rwieruch","descendants":4,"id":14087078,"kids":[14090460,14089706,14089764],"score":7,"text":"I am curious to hear about your most influential persons during your professional, but also during your private life.

What course (length, online&#x2F;offline) should I go for?\nThanks for the feedback!","time":1491776434,"title":"To code or not to code?","type":"story"},{"by":"greatNespresso","descendants":6,"id":14074648,"kids":[14074979,14075711,14074977],"score":14,"time":1491776539,"title":"Show HN: Chat via the console, with now and socket.io","type":"story","url":"https://gloubiboulga.now.sh/"},{"by":"grandjury","descendants":21,"id":14074622,"kids":[14075217,14075178,14076615,14074994,14075209,14075533,14075434,14078818,14077155,14077072],"score":65,"time":1491776087,"title":"Show HN: Txtpen – web highlights and in-text comments","type":"story","url":"https://txtpen.com"},{"by":"heyts","descendants":21,"id":14074594,"kids":[14074925,14075754,14075050,14074856,14077107,14074961,14075965,14078277],"score":91,"time":1491775701,"title":"Pioneers of Soviet Computing [pdf]","type":"story","url":"http://www.sigcis.org/files/SIGCISMC2010_001.pdf"},{"by":"misnamed","descendants":56,"id":14074566,"kids":[14077133,14076987,14076418,14076656,14076743,14076420,14076829,14077886],"score":115,"time":1491775203,"title":"Sleep Is the New Status Symbol","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/08/fashion/sleep-tips-and-tools.html"},{"by":"aaronbrethorst","descendants":73,"id":14074494,"kids":[14074922,14075239,14074989,14075357,14075123,14075006],"score":52,"time":1491773969,"title":"Can Wind Power Revive Jobs in America's Heartland?","type":"story","url":"https://www.citylab.com/work/2017/04/why-is-trump-ignoring-these-good-heartland-jobs/521823/?utm_source=SFTwitter"},{"by":"stuartlogan","descendants":3,"id":14074369,"kids":[14074803,14074378],"score":3,"time":1491772115,"title":"The investor mega-list","type":"story","url":"https://www.twine.fm/blog/the-investor-mega-list/"},{"by":"a-smith","descendants":57,"id":14074370,"kids":[14075134,14074720,14075447,14075341,14075653,14075438,14075525,14077175,14075735,14077963,14077583,14076282,14075235,14075402,14079265],"score":96,"time":1491772126,"title":"Graffiti 'dying out' as kids dump spray cans for Instagram, Twitter etc.","type":"story","url":"https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/04/07/social_media_blamed_for_drop_in_graffiti_art/"},{"by":"curtis","descendants":82,"id":14074487,"kids":[14074841,14076993,14074833,14075014,14075891,14074718,14074840,14074776,14078713,14074882,14075017,14074639,14074788,14078175,14074920],"score":218,"time":1491773859,"title":"How ski lifts are installed: Vail's new Chair 5 (2011) [video]","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CSxkYnyFg0"},{"by":"ziikutv","descendants":11,"id":14074234,"kids":[14074561,14074507,14076168,14075777],"score":21,"text":"Why am I getting taught this in final year of university.<p>Is this paradigm still used in non-legacy areas?<p>Regards,","time":1491770080,"title":"Ask HN: What Happened to Model Driven Development","type":"story"},{"by":"doener","dead":true,"id":14074209,"kids":[14074264,14074239],"score":1,"time":1491769741,"title":"Don’t let people park for free","type":"story","url":"http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21720269-dont-let-people-park-free-how-not-create-traffic-jams-pollution-and-urban-sprawl?frsc=dg%7Ce"},{"by":"iamjeff","descendants":57,"id":14074148,"kids":[14074514,14075393,14074412,14075245,14074517,14074376,14074295,14074620,14075852,14076345,14075800,14077171,14095740,14086393,14074462,14074385,14075445,14074484,14074490],"score":205,"time":1491769031,"title":"Photos from Inside North Korea (2014)","type":"story","url":"http://www.earthnutshell.com/100-photos-from-north-korea-part1/"},{"by":"swf","descendants":6,"id":14074066,"kids":[14096587,14076849,14146231],"score":14,"time":1491767849,"title":"Show HN: Legionizer – a React app that lets you recreate the Legion TV credits","type":"story","url":"http://www.legionizer.com/"},{"by":"AlexAMEEE","descendants":15,"id":14074023,"kids":[14094364,14079554,14080716,14085982,14074065,14085209,14090646,14077663,14099246,14076683],"score":15,"text":"I read this:<p>&gt; 8.

A site like Reddit is interesting when there are only 20 users. But no one wants to use a dating site with only 20 users—which of course becomes a self-perpetuating problem.

Monitors are always advertised according to the length of their hypotenuse,<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;YY8YHIn.jpg<p>so if a monitor says it is a 22-inch monitor, it is saying it&#x27;s hypotenuse is 22 inches long. This isn&#x27;t very useful for me though, I need to know how wide it is to know whether it&#x27;ll fit onto my desk, and to convert the hypotenuse to a width, I have to use Pythagoras.<p>The sides of monitors aren&#x27;t often the same length though, they are usually wider than they are tall. A normal monitor (and any monitor I want to buy) will have dimensions in the ratio 16:9, i.e. for every 16 centimeters they are long horizontally, they are 9 centimeters tall vertically. In simpler terms, we can label the width of our monitor 16x and the height of it 9x, like so:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;JxdFyLR.jpg<p><i>Image not to scale.</i><p>We know (thanks to Pythagoras) that a^2 + b^2 = c^2 , but how does this translate to our beautiful <i>real life</i> problem? Well it translates as (16x)^2 + (9x)^2 = (our hypotenuse)^2. (16x)^2 is 256x^2 and (9x)^2 is 81x^2 so together, c2=(81+256)x^2 or 337x^2. To get c alone we then need to square root 337x^2 , we receive 18.36x.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;92LN2UR.jpg<p>Final step now. My desk only has space for a monitor 17.5 inches wide, what is the hypotenuse of said monitor (assuming it is in the ratio 16:9)? Well, if 17.5 inches = 16x, then x = (17.5&#x2F;16) inches. If our hypotenuse is 18.36x, then in inches it is 18.36 times (17.5&#x2F;16), (or put simply) 20.08 inches. So what size monitor am I going to buy? I&#x27;m going to buy a 20 inch monitor.<p>Extension Question: How tall is my monitor going to be?","time":1491661489,"title":"'When will I use Pythagoras (or Ratios) in real

The second one is from a company in London (UK), with ~ £40k salary. I&#x27;d be working with a more &quot;modern&quot; stack (think Python&#x2F;JS&#x2F;Ruby&#x2F;Go&#x2F;etc).<p>Following is a somewhat unstructured collection of thoughts.<p>Location:\nLondon &gt;&gt; Ottawa. I&#x27;d be looking at a ~40-60min commute (by bus) in Ottawa. For London, public transit and cycling infrastructure seem good. I&#x27;m more familiar with Ottawa as I&#x27;ve done an internship there, while my impression of London is based solely on a short visit. Generally though, London seems to be a more exciting (but expensive) place to live.<p>Type of work:\nThe first offer seems more interesting as I would love to work on performance-type problems.<p>People&#x2F;team:\nWhen interviewing with the first company, I met with two people from my would-be team (including the manager), and with multiple senior engineers from other teams. The company has a high proportion of senior engineers. For the second company, I got to meet a larger portion of the team. There were a couple instances during the interview and several post-interview phone calls where I thought &quot;man, I&#x27;d really love to work with this person&quot;.<p>Immigration:\nFor the sake of future stability, it is important for me to get permanent residency regardless of where I end up. Based on my research, getting a PR in Canada is much faster compared to getting an ILR in the UK.<p>Some of the questions on my mind are:<p>- Would it be irresponsible to give up the PR in Canada and move away?<p>- Would I later regret not moving to London in my early twenties?<p>- What&#x27;s more important: work or people?<p>- How important is compensation for the first job out of college?<p>Would really appreciate any help&#x2F;input&#x2F;advice, especially from people later in their careers who have had to make similar choices.","time":1491601199,"title":"Ask HN: Career advice for a new grad","type":"story"},{"by":"shahzeb","descendants":203,"id":14063818,"kids":[14064167,14064476,14064440,14064114,14065629,14064076,14064397,14065355,14066135,14064644,14064250,14064090,14065251,14064564,14065030,14064156,14066918,14064548,14068170,14065687,14066498,14064129,14066503],"score":453,"time":1491602426,"title":"React v15.5.0","type":"story","url":"https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2017/04/07/react-v15.5.0.html"},{"by":"zeveb","descendants":18,"id":14063664,"kids":[14064560,14065845],"score":82,"time":1491600720,"title":"Radiance: a flexible web-application environment for Common Lisp","type":"story","url":"https://shirakumo.github.io/radiance-homepage/"},{"by":"Tomte","descendants":156,"id":14063609,"kids":[14066077,14064737,14065143,14065633,14065380,14064371,14065184,14064767,14064133,14064926,14065049,14064230,14064756,14064788,14066488,14065243,14064343,14064130,14065664,14086914,14066297,14065269,14064835,14064545,14067995,14064658,14064969,14068395,14064893,14065594,14072204,14065912,14064828,14064684,14066547,14064948,14064946,14066489,14064351,14065015],"score":625,"time":1491600192,"title":"Color Night Vision (2016) [video]","type":"story","url":"http://kottke.org/17/04/incredible-low-light-camera-turns-night-into-day"},{"by":"solomioo","descendants":10,"id":14063615,"kids":[14063942,14063921,14063857,14063965,14063918,14066880,14063914,14063910,14073065],"score":26,"time":1491600274,"title":"Ask HN: Anyone making $10k+/mo on a sideproject?","type":"story"},{"by":"dhd415","descendants":3,"id":14063699,"kids":[14065916,14065870],"score":23,"time":1491601033,"title":"AWS Aurora MySQL adds fast DDL operations","type":"story","url":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/amazon-aurora-under-the-hood-fast-ddl/"},{"by":"lladnar","descendants":2,"id":14063574,"kids":[14063782,14064555,14063802],"score":27,"time":1491599899,"title":"Twitch unleashes scorched-earth attack to unveil malicious spambot creator","type":"story","url":"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/04/twitch-unleashes-scorched-earth-attack-to-unveil-malicious-spambot-creator/"},{"by":"iDemonix","descendants":3,"id":14063261,"kids":[14063297,14123786],"score":1,"text":"My day job involves looking after a Cloud Linux web hosting setup, based on WHM and cPanel, for a few thousand small customers in a niche sector.<p>I freelance and create (mostly WordPress powered) websites for small to medium businesses, as well as eCommerce sites and so on.

Each node is responsible for a small field of view, similar to a neuron.

I have won other lesser known cups and finished second in the latest cup. In the high times issue out this month, the cannabis I grow is 7 out of the 20 &quot;strongest strains on earth.&quot;  And that includes the number 1 highest tested CBD strain. 20%cdb with minuscule amounts of THC.

How to handle this in interviews?<p>I&#x27;m preparing to interview at top-tier firms -- I especially want to work at Google. The problem is that I&#x27;ve had some mental issues that have held back my career development. I have accomplishments: I&#x27;ve shipped hit iPhone games. I&#x27;ve been told that I&#x27;m the best programming teacher that a student&#x27;s ever had. But, I&#x27;ve gotten a reputation as a really smart guy who&#x27;s easy to work with, but who&#x27;s slow to deliver. Thing is, as of 2017 -- I&#x27;ve solved this problem to my satisfaction. How do I handle this discrepancy between potential and results &#x2F; references when applying to jobs?<p>I&#x27;m 40 ish; I started University three years early, but failed out in my last year.<p>Around 2001-2002, I was diagnosed with Adult ADHD, and started taking meds. I developed severe side-effects and had to stop.<p>After that I bounced back and forth between jobs and being self-employed every 1-3 years. The same lack of focus was just deadly to any kind of entrepreneurship.<p>Fast forward to 2016. Got separated, sold house. Bailed on teaching gigs. Almost died. Basically, shit the bed.<p>To start 2017, I stopped drinking alcohol and caffeine. This greatly improved my sleep quality. All of a sudden it was no problem to get up at 6:30 am, and I had better concentration throughout the day.<p>A couple of months ago I started taking a new generation of ADD meds (Strattera). The results have been remarkable! I simply don&#x27;t procrastinate. Total game changer!<p>So there&#x27;s this radical increase in my effectiveness now that I want to use as a positive when applying to jobs. How should I handle what I consider to be this greatly positive change?

Or will I have to wait until the board &amp; lawyers approve the whole thing, which could mean the FMV will likely have increased by then because of the Series C (and I will be effectively screwed, because the AMT tax portion would be much larger?).<p>In other words, would this timeline work?<p>- (April 2017) I leave the company and pay $40k for exercising<p>- (May 2017) The company raises the Series C, increasing its \nvalue<p>- (June&#x2F;July 2017) Lawyers&#x2F;board process my exercise and send me the certificate saying I am a stock owner<p>- (at some point between August 2017 and April 2018) I pay $70k to IRS, even if the FMV is increased<p>Thank you","time":1491232645,"title":"Ask HN: Exercising stock options with imminent new round of funding (AMT panic)","type":"story"},{"by":"bandrami","descendants":4,"id":14023376,"kids":[14023453,14023880],"score":2,"time":1491232686,"title":"The last thing America needs from Trump's infrastructure plan is more roads","type":"story","url":"http://www.slate.com/articles/business/metropolis/2017/04/the_last_thing_america_needs_from_trump_s_infrastructure_plan_is_more_roads.html"},{"by":"craigcannon","descendants":66,"id":14023864,"kids":[14025586,14026533,14026140,14026685,14027823,14025844,14025696,14027135,14026054,14029166,14025440,14026386,14028750,14027122,14030864,14030429,14026742,14026975,14029685,14030940,14027737,14030936,14035093,14035100],"score":212,"time":1491235271,"title":"Hacking DNA: CRISPR, Ken Thompson, and the Gene Drive","type":"story","url":"https://blog.ycombinator.com/hacking-dna-the-story-of-crispr-ken-thompson-and-the-gene-drive/"},{"by":"ayanai","descendants":124,"id":14023255,"kids":[14024458,14025213,14024980,14026449,14026059,14024855,14025070,14024454,14024374],"score":166,"time":1491231977,"title":"'Hitler Tamed by Prison' (1924)","type":"story","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/04/03/new-york-times-in-1924-hitler-tamed-by-prison/"},{"by":"ayanai","descendants":586,"id":14023223,"kids":[14023559,14028701,14024619,14023804,14025146,14023622,14025339,14023779,14024209,14024196,14025389,14024045,14027305,14023828,14025165,14024246,14024638,14024866,14023624,14023831,14024390,14025946,14024043,14025625,14024094,14025607,14025222,14027213,14033311,14024412,14027138,14025486,14025503,14024050,14024055],"score":846,"time":1491231767,"title":"Tesla Passes Ford by Market Value","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-03/tesla-passes-ford-by-market-value-before-musk-delivers-model-3"},{"by":"pilom","descendants":2,"id":14023281,"kids":[14026738,14028751],"score":7,"text":"Everyone in my office came in today saying that their computer clock was reading 1 hour faster than it should have.

at ideas for my college-bound kid who&#x27;s going for a CS degree.<p>The idea is for him to invest the summer on something that will give him access to a higher earning potential for part time or freelance work.<p>The extent of his experience is having done the MIT &quot;Computational Problem Solving with Python&quot; course on EDx. He applied some of it to minor problems, including doing some Euler Project and his FRC robotics team. No real web dev experience. Some playing around with HTML, etc., nothing serious. No Linux experience.<p>Yes, I know, not the best starting point. Not the worst either.<p>What to do over the summer?<p>One thought was to send him to a good coding bootcamp and have him invest three months at high intensity learning full stack development.<p>The other option is to have him dive into a bunch of Udemy and EDx courses under my guidance and supervision.<p>I don&#x27;t have the option of tutoring him full time. My plate is full with business responsibilities. What I can do is provide support, guidance and be available for questions, etc.<p>I don&#x27;t mind spending the money on a bootcamp if it fulfills the stated goal of allowing him to have access to higher paying part-time or freelance gigs. The theory being that he will be able to earn more in less time and, therefore, focus on his CS studies. Without this kind of a push forward I can&#x27;t see him earning anything more than minimum wage at essentially entry level clerical or service jobs.<p>I also considered the idea of him not going to university immediately.

For one, I have passed the book through a professional editor, as well as rounded out chapters with summaries and even added 3 new sections, including:<p>- Sending keys to tmux, aka `send-keys`<p>- Copying pane contents to the paste buffer programmatically, aka `capture-pane`<p>- Building and using tmux-mem-cpu-load [3]<p>Countless areas of the book have been rewritten for clarity. The process of editing alone fielded <i>over 650</i> tweaks. New graphics have been added. The configuration chapter has been overhauled, and various new examples of usage for targets (`-t`) [4] and formats (`-F`) [5] have been added.<p>The book is available for purchase on Leanpub, in DRM-free epub, mobi and pdf format at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leanpub.com&#x2F;the-tao-of-tmux\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leanpub.com&#x2F;the-tao-of-tmux</a>.<p>In addition, the book is available on Amazon Kindle at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B01MG342KU\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B01MG342KU</a>.<p>The book will always be available for free on the web.<p>P.S.

To give you an idea, these photos are all of the same woman - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dropbox.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;52ew0d8hsxwx0k4&#x2F;JodianHairstyles.png?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dropbox.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;52ew0d8hsxwx0k4&#x2F;JodianHairstyles.p...</a> - It&#x27;s an image from  our YC demo day slides.<p>The process of figuring all this out to actually getting a style done is long and broken. Many women spend a ton of time searching for their next hairstyle, then more time figuring out how to replicate the style via tutorial articles&#x2F;videos or search for a stylist and so on. Tress aims to be the dedicated platform to fix all of this and connect a community of women who often socialize around their unique hair needs.<p>One thing that excites us as software engineers is exploring how to use computer vision to tell if a user has 4a, 4b or 4c natural hair curl pattern or if a hairstyle is a Senegalese twists or Havana mambo twists.  We are equally excited to be gathering hair products data and usage patterns around our hairstyles in such an informal sector that technology has barely gotten started in yet. We dream of things like an API that has all the data about the hair products black women have used in the past 5 years.<p>We&#x27;re looking forward to answering your questions about Tress and discussing startups, software, and of course hair!","time":1490982165,"title":"Launch HN: Tress (YC W17) – Online community for black women's hairstyles","type":"story"},{"by":"daenz","descendants":261,"id":14006059,"kids":[14008800,14007208,14007524,14008031,14008047,14007079,14006732,14008280,14008822,14006915,14008636,14007446,14007484,14006802,14008170,14007802,14008121,14011195,14007421,14008450,14008449,14007968],"score":321,"time":1490981573,"title":"Wikileaks releases CIA's Marble: Malware obfuscation tools","type":"story","url":"https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_14588467.html?marble=1"},{"by":"e15ctr0n","descendants":15,"id":14006291,"kids":[14007673,14008003,14007956,14007853,14007852],"score":17,"time":1490983091,"title":"Even if you're rich, you could die poor","type":"story","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/get-there/the-color-of-money-book-club-falling-by-william-mcpherson/2017/03/31/698bfee6-13d3-11e7-833c-503e1f6394c9_story.html"},{"by":"Apane","descendants":4,"id":14006001,"kids":[14015378,14006161,14006259],"score":1,"text":"If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late. - Reid Hoffman, Founder, LinkedIn<p>We&#x27;re getting ready to work on our version two of the product and we&#x27;ve already got our new design underway.
