I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of rejections, for job positions I know I&#x27;m qualified for, and it&#x27;s beginning to make me look for a pattern and question things. I assumed having nearly 15 years of experience writing enterprise-level software, my experience would be desirable as I get more years under my belt. I&#x27;m looking for remote work so interviews are usually over the phone, and have a casual tone. When I mention that I have a wife and kids, I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s good or bad in the company&#x27;s eyes. Do they only want younger devs, without other obligations, who can work 60+ hrs&#x2F;week? Do they think I&#x27;m too old? I recently read this about the hiring process at Automattic:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;cate.blog&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;15&#x2F;addressing-hiring-gaps-through-user-research&#x2F;<p><i>&quot;To that end, as we reviewed our hiring process, we realized that the demographics of people we attract to apply are not inline with the demographics of the people we hope to hire. Whilst we have implemented a strong focus on metrics, and made certain adjustments, we’ve not seen the improvements we want. If this was a product, we would go to our users and ask them – so why not do the same here?<p>... we’re looking for women and non-binary people (trans&#x2F;cis&#x2F;gnc) who may experience similar gender discrimination in the workplace, who have multiple years of experience in a software development role.&quot;</i><p>So, they have a lot of straight, white male developers and their product goals aren&#x27;t being met, so it might be because of the skin color and sexual orientation of their employees? I was a little surprised that Automattic would be so open and proud of their discriminatory hiring practices.<p>Am I being too sensitive? Is the discrimination real? Or maybe it&#x27;s always been this way and I didn&#x27;t notice when I was younger and landing the good jobs. Sorry if this post sounds like rant, but I&#x27;ve been a big fan of Hacker News for a long time and enjoy reading the threads because I genuinely value everyone&#x27;s input here.","time":1563798356,"title":"Ask HN: Is it just me or is the IT field becoming discriminatory?","type":"story"},{"by":"mhb","descendants":176,"id":20497237,"kids":[20497419,20497414,20498557,20498409,20497674,20497572,20497567,20497556,20497440,20498391,20497468,20499385,20502345,20497361,20497395,20497603,20497426,20498801,20498058,20497543,20499148,20497697],"score":102,"time":1563797792,"title":"Airlines are finally fixing the middle seat","type":"story","url":"https://www.fastcompany.com/90377949/airlines-are-finally-fixing-the-middle-seat"},{"by":"tosh","descendants":4,"id":20497216,"kids":[20497342,20497577],"score":9,"time":1563797538,"title":"Lasagna Code","type":"story","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code#Lasagna_code"},{"by":"DarkContinent","descendants":23,"id":20497098,"kids":[20506377,20508120,20507661,20507379,20505193,20506485,20507806,20510224,20507047,20506993,20507463,20506398],"score":71,"time":1563796589,"title":"Mother Earth Mother Board (1996)","type":"story","url":"https://www.wired.com/1996/12/ffglass/"},{"by":"imartin2k","descendants":8,"id":20497041,"kids":[20510291,20510472,20510930],"score":45,"time":1563795741,"title":"The Role of Doubt in Design","type":"story","url":"https://matthewstrom.com/writing/doubt/"},{"by":"chamoda","descendants":2,"id":20496967,"kids":[20497422,20497640],"score":2,"text":"I&#x27;m a lead engineer at a software company.

Could a new terminal be written, with similar ease of development to that of a TUI, but also more advanced features? Maybe a spec that translated basic TUIs into pretty drawn screen widgets?<p>So I ask you: Do you think TUIs could be improved to give modern &quot;pretty&quot; rendering and features, while also keeping the most of the simplicity of development and interaction that we all know and love with TUIs?

A taboo I don&#x27;t remember existing as strongly when I was a kid (80s&#x2F;90s). Given this taboo, my wife and I instituted time-based restriction on device usage. The end result: access to an iPad or iPhone is the source of a lot of consternation and conflict in our family. It&#x27;s the primary punishment and reward. Of course, meanwhile, we parents use our laptops all day for work, look at our phones, text, read the news, a gazillion other things our parents would have done through analog methods.<p>What I observe is these days so much that would have been done without a screen needs to be done with a screen (phone calls, looking something up in an encyclopedia, research, a lot of book reading, reading the news). Also screens allow us to do a lot of things our generation couldn&#x27;t do that are really positive for kids (text friends in another country, facetime with grandparents, etc). Not to mention limits on their abilities to hack on code. All of which seem to be conflated with watching the 20th meaningless minecraft youtube video.<p>I&#x27;d be curious what the HN community feels about kids + screentime?<p>- Do you limit screentime writ large with an overall limit?<p>- Do you set limits on the kind of screentime they get?<p>- What protocol do you follow (X hrs per day, have to ask first, but are limitted?)<p>- What do you do if they truly want to do something educational&#x2F;positive with screentime but have hit their limits?","time":1563481837,"title":"Ask HN: What rules do you set for your kids screentime?","type":"story"},{"by":"londev","descendants":21,"id":20473522,"kids":[20478901,20476037,20475447,20476845,20475458,20476446,20473703,20475472],"score":64,"time":1563480912,"title":"Someone is still maintaining the Space Jam website","type":"story","url":"https://spacejam.com"},{"by":"jppope","descendants":30,"id":20473505,"kids":[20480351,20478602,20474347,20474176,20473953,20474696,20486605,20474718,20481532,20473805,20493548,20476534,20490133,20490192,20488931,20475326,20495324,20476579,20482112],"score":17,"text":"I just took a moment to pause today and realized how much things have changed in the past decade... and how wrong I was about some trends didn&#x27;t take off and others did (E.G.

here is the usual! A guy with a great understanding of tech but has no skills to get down and dirty. I have written heartfelt briefs, tried to hire a tech team (which failed woefully). Got the right team, but can&#x27;t afford high bill for now. Also spent a lot of time of several fora posting similar messages, seeking a tech co-founder.<p>The question for me is - How do I find a tech co-founder to work with us? My idea is oversimplified and part of a first step into a series of biztech solutions for small businesses. It seems that I have not been able to communicate our message or vision to would be cofounders clearly. My current partner is a frontend designer and has no backend skills required. If we can get that programer to share in the vision, I am sure we will be a well rounded team that can &quot;take on the world&quot;.<p>Brief: Invoicing SaaS product at MVP stage. Design interface design completed. Looking for a programmer who can join us in taking our app to the next level and launch in the market this year.

The virus then alters the RNA&#x2F;DNA after finding a match for the preprogrammed location it is to cut and insert DNA.<p>I worry that a state or non-state actor may find the genetic signature for an adversarial ethnic group and target that group using a genetic virus using CRISPR. So for example, the mechanism for infection could be a cold virus. The virus would simply cause the common cold in any non-adversarial group. If the virus detects that the host belongs to the adversarial group via some genetic marker it could do all sorts of terrible things to the genetic makeup of the host like cause sterilization, mess with hormone production, alter mechanisms that affect impulse control etc.<p>What worries me for this is that the weapon could be deployed and it would be impossible to know who deployed the weapon.

Wren lets you offset your carbon footprint by funding projects that prevent or sequester greenhouse gas emissions. It works by calculating your carbon footprint and then funding a project of your choice through a monthly subscription. Some of the projects we have right now involve planting forests in East Africa, providing more efficient cookstoves to Ugandan refugees, and preventing deforestation in the Amazon.<p>We met in college, and worked together on numerous side projects and class projects. After a while we decided to try finding a meaningful project that we could work on after graduation. At the time, we didn&#x27;t know much about the science or emerging technologies for mitigating climate change, but we saw carbon offsets and asked ourselves &quot;why isn&#x27;t everyone doing this?&quot; Then we got to work on Wren.<p>Carbon offsets have been around for a while, and with some googling, research, and phone calls anyone can find reliable and transparent projects. Our goal is to make it as easy and enjoyable as possible to offset your footprint. We only work with projects that have good evidence suggesting they&#x27;re long lasting and reliable. We also only work with projects that wouldn&#x27;t happen without support from Wren users. In addition to climate benefits, we prefer projects with strong social impact. Projects listed on Wren reduce lung cancer risk for refugees, provide millions of dollars of economic benefit to subsistence farmers, and protect biodiversity.<p>We see climate change as the most important problem we can work on. Despite growing evidence of the damage it will cause, governments are not taking necessary action. Wren is a way for an individual to have impact today.<p>Most in this space are nonprofits but we are a business. We take a 20% fee on each subscription. This allows us to hire talented engineers, invest in marketing, and raise capital. This way we can build tools that make our projects more transparent and reliable—daily satellite images of forest projects, data visualizations of tree trunk diameters, and other ways we can build more trust for these projects.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a lot of posts on HN recently about climate change and potential solutions so I&#x27;m looking forward to a good discussion :)","time":1563382902,"title":"Launch HN: Wren (YC S19) – Offset Your Carbon Footprint","type":"story"},{"by":"tosh","descendants":17,"id":20461514,"kids":[20477742,20476905,20477904,20476961,20478634,20483226,20488148,20477923,20479318],"score":103,"time":1563382461,"title":"The Machine Stops (1909) [pdf]","type":"story","url":"https://www.ele.uri.edu/faculty/vetter/Other-stuff/The-Machine-Stops.pdf"},{"by":"lumengxi","descendants":3,"id":20461957,"kids":[20465240,20462205],"score":7,"time":1563384707,"title":"Binary is the past, Korean researchers develop ternary semiconductor tech","type":"story","url":"https://www.zdnet.com/article/korean-researchers-develop-ternary-semiconductor-tech/"},{"by":"benlcollins","descendants":14,"id":20461952,"kids":[20466988,20469503,20467965,20464427,20464738,20467642,20464559],"score":99,"time":1563384672,"title":"Google Sheets Formula Clock","type":"story","url":"https://www.benlcollins.com/spreadsheets/google-sheets-formula-clock/"},{"by":"ccdev","descendants":2,"id":20461430,"kids":[20461474,20461702],"score":1,"text":"I have worked for businesses that lean towards the very small side.

It has been pointed out that slack already does essentially this, which gives me hope.<p>I’m no security expert, and it’s probably about to show.<p>I’ve had an idea for a simple passwordless auth system bouncing around in my head. I’ve seen similar ideas floated once or twice before but don’t see it used anywhere, so I’m assuming it’s not as good of an idea as I think it is. The idea is essentially to use a password reset flow for all logins, not just when you need to reset your password. So it goes something like this:<p>User prompted for and inputs email address\nServer sends them an email with a randomly generated key. The key expires in a short period (5-10 minutes) or after first use, whichever is sooner.\nUser inputs key (possibly automatically by clicking a link in the email).\nServer verifies the key, generates a random token, and sets it in a cookie&#x2F;local storage which is valid for a reasonable session period (a day or two, maybe a week).<p>Advantages:<p>* Very simple to implement. Few moving pieces.<p>* Authorization can be handled by associating resources with lists of authorized email addresses, so technically users don&#x27;t need an &quot;account&quot; in order to &quot;login&quot; and access the resources.<p>* User doesn’t have to remember a password. If you can prove you control the email address, you’re authenticated.<p>* No passwords to hack&#x2F;phish from the database.<p>Disadvantages:<p>* If someone gets control of your email address, they have complete control over any service relying on this system. However, I don’t see this as different from password reset flows which rely on email (ie Slack’s magic links).<p>* User has to open their email every time they login.<p>* You tell me.","time":1563310567,"title":"Ask HN: Tell me why this auth system is a bad idea","type":"story"},{"by":"softvar","descendants":3,"id":20453590,"kids":[20453603,20453645,20453614],"score":1,"time":1563309104,"title":"Ask HN: Is GitHub Down?","type":"story"},{"by":"rdslw","descendants":9,"id":20453586,"kids":[20454728,20456809,20459572,20454814,20455271],"score":39,"time":1563309068,"title":"Running NMAP on your Airbnb network is a great way to find hidden cameras","type":"story","url":"https://twitter.com/VirtueSecurity/status/1151104740257910784"},{"by":"howard941","descendants":12,"id":20453718,"kids":[20454706,20454715,20454563,20454860],"score":33,"time":1563309991,"title":"Disney heiress ‘livid’ after going to one of her family’s theme parks undercover","type":"story","url":"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/disney-heiress-livid-after-going-to-one-of-her-familys-theme-parks-undercover-2019-07-15?mod=mw_share_twitter"},{"by":"adventured","descendants":4,"id":20453526,"kids":[20455672,20453739],"score":3,"time":1563308579,"title":"Forget Silicon Valley, It Still Pays More to Be a Doctor in America","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-16/which-u-s-jobs-pay-the-most-top-ten-professions-by-salary"},{"by":"onetimemanytime","descendants":2,"id":20453480,"kids":[20457995,20453484],"score":4,"time":1563308137,"title":"Parts of the Marshall Islands now more radioactive than Chernobyl","type":"story","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/places-more-radioactive-than-chernobyl-marshall-islands-2019-7"},{"by":"steveklabnik","descendants":3,"id":20453837,"kids":[20455487,20454516],"score":14,"time":1563310736,"title":"A proactive approach to more secure code","type":"story","url":"https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/16/a-proactive-approach-to-more-secure-code/"},{"by":"Copenjin","descendants":2,"id":20453321,"kids":[20453470,20454634],"score":2,"time":1563306961,"title":"Storm Area 51: US Air Force Warns over Facebook Event","type":"story","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-48989949"},{"by":"Austin_Conlon","descendants":2,"id":20453417,"kids":[20453561,20453606],"score":3,"time":1563307601,"title":"Ask HN: Are cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology innovative?","type":"story"},{"by":"president","descendants":298,"id":20453248,"kids":[20453937,20453381,20455386,20454575,20457816,20457758,20454123,20455793,20453324,20454051,20454230,20454979,20453348,20455874,20455288,20455543,20456455,20454361,20455353,20454370,20454013,20457735,20453992,20455118,20456004,20455503,20455032,20453893,20459440,20456111,20455346,20456179,20454725,20455794,20457962,20456210,20455447,20453967,20454386,20455350,20455734,20456348,20457629,20453957,20456713,20457452,20454118,20454034,20458984,20454286,20455255,20456818,20455465,20455043,20456207,20454699,20457277,20457001,20458151,20474183,20454439,20454360,20456175,20457609,20458018,20458014,20456498,20453870,20454946,20454047,20456137,20454626,20457171,20455505,20458102,20454904,20455893,20453928,20457573,20473558,20455171,20461909,20456797,20459262,20455415,20457060,20456057,20455128,20455573,20458385,20453921,20457674,20457354,20455621,20457616,20454987,20456066,20457469,20454380,20457472,20455845,20455625,20454822,20455914,20455551,20454537,20456332,20457984,20460584,20457285,20455733,20454298,20453600,20504820,20458922,20456041,20457056,20455866,20453930,20454775,20458150,20455449,20458466,20457897,20454515,20454847,20457146,20456815,20454226,20457577,20454977,20468712,20456151,20457612,20455676,20453900,20455066,20454426,20456988,20454413,20457306,20455715,20457295,20465707,20456002,20483453,20455883,20455669,20457300,20454518,20489165,20459139,20454471,20460302,20457910],"score":329,"text":"I work in an office environment (large Bay Area corporate enterprise software co) where people are constantly cutting each other off in conversations and technical discussions.

There are many small things like some tips or quotes or an idea  or the rent in a locality near me. Sometimes is some random conversation, somebody mentions a price of something and if I can note it down, it will be of help in the future. Bascially small things that you remember randomly but are useful. Most of often I find that I dont remember it in the right time. So I decided to write it down.<p>The tool that just helped is Google Keep. I dont write a title, just the note. These are basically text less than a tweet (280 char). For easy searching, I write associated keywords. But the issue is I might use many keywords for the same idea or misspell a keyword. I regularly write &#x27;color&#x27; &amp; &#x27;colour&#x27; or &#x27;code&#x27; &amp; &#x27;script&#x27;. So I feel tags are more appropriate.

I&#x27;m in my late 20s, have no Bachelor’s degree and no job. I&#x27;ve been applying for various positions in software engineering for quite some time, to no avail.<p>The thing is, I have a lot of programming experience. I started coding at the age of 12: first in C++ Builder, then I moved to Pascal and C. At the age of 14 I&#x27;ve become obsessed with low-level programming and reverse engineering. I&#x27;ve spent my high school in IDA and SoftIce, writing programs in wasm. Subsequently I&#x27;ve also become interested in web development, and my first real job was a Front-End Developer. At different points of life, I&#x27;ve written programs in C, C++, Pascal, ASP.NET, x86 assembly, php, python, Octave, Haskell, OCaml, coq, Isabelle.<p>I guess I pretty much stopped coding at the age of 21. I&#x27;ve become interested in mathematics. I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time studying university-level mathematics, and at some point I&#x27;ve actually enrolled in a program in pure mathematics, but eventually dropped out. I&#x27;ve also discovered the world of formal verification and type theories. I actually managed to find a job in formal verification and worked at this position for one year.<p>And now I&#x27;m stuck. I&#x27;m not a mathematician, and I obviously can&#x27;t find a job as a mathematician without a Bachelor&#x27;s degree. I also can&#x27;t find a job in formal verification. In my country this market is narrow, and you need to have a PhD to squeeze in. And I&#x27;m not a software developer either: all my skills are rusty or obsolete, I haven&#x27;t really been doing this thing for a while.<p>So, I have a lot of time, I have a strong background in mathematics.

With our open source framework and our web app, analysts can develop and schedule reliable pipelines to turn raw data into reliable datasets they need for analytics.<p>Before starting Dataform, we managed engineering teams in AdSense and led product analytics for publisher ads. We heavily relied on data (and data pipelines!) to generate insights, drive better decisions and build better products. Companies like Google invest a lot to build internal data tools for analysts to manage data and build data pipelines. In 5 minutes I could define a new dataset in SQL that would be updated every day and then use it in my reports.<p>Most businesses today are centralising their raw data into cloud data warehouses but lack the tools to manage it efficiently. Pipelines run manually or via custom scripts that break often. Or the company decides to invest engineering resources to set up, maintain and debug a framework like Airflow. But that’s just for scheduling and the technical bar is often too high for analysts to contribute.<p>We saw a need for a self-service solution for data teams to manage data efficiently, so that analysts can own the entire workflow from raw data to analytics. We built Dataform with two core principles in mind:<p>1. Bring engineering best practices to data management. \nIn Dataform, you build data pipelines in SQL, and our open source framework lets you seamlessly define dependencies, build incremental tables and reuse code across scripts. You can write tests against your raw and transformed data to ensure data quality across your analytics. Lastly, our development environment also facilitates the adoption of best practices, where analysts can develop with version control, code review or sandboxed environments.<p>2. Let data teams focus on data, not infrastructure. \nWe want to bring a better, faster and cheaper alternative to what businesses have to build and maintain in-house today. Our web app comes with a collaborative SQL editor, where teams develop and push their changes to GitHub. You can then orchestrate your data pipelines without having to maintain any infrastructure.<p>Here&#x27;s is a short video demo where we develop two new datasets, push the code to GitHub and schedule their execution, in under 5 minutes.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=axDKf0_FhYU\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=axDKf0_FhYU</a><p>You can sign up at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dataform.co\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dataform.co</a>.

After, say, 10 former clients have uploaded contact info for the same plumber the platform will then aggregate that data, publish it and make it available for everyone who&#x27;s a registered user of the platform (basically, crowdsourcing). \nQuestion: am I allowed to do this under the GDPR rules and how do I comply with them?","time":1563172996,"title":"GDPR and Aggregated Contact Info","type":"story"},{"by":"cameronbrown","descendants":2,"id":20438634,"kids":[20438955,20447702],"score":4,"time":1563172840,"title":"Ask HN: What are some of your favourite submissions of all time?","type":"story"},{"by":"josephburchett","descendants":6,"id":20438479,"kids":[20438750,20438499],"score":2,"time":1563169957,"title":"Show HN: Remindo – easily and quickly create SMS reminders","type":"story","url":"https://remindo.me"},{"by":"ETHisso2017","descendants":2,"id":20438379,"kids":[20438575,20438568],"score":2,"time":1563168619,"title":"“Someone got lucky” – the $1.8B Trump-Xi trade","type":"story","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/07/the-mystery-of-the-wall-street-trump-trades"},{"by":"arunbahl","descendants":5,"id":20438316,"kids":[20438638,20438722,20439536],"score":29,"time":1563167641,"title":"Alternative theory of gravity makes a nearly testable prediction","type":"story","url":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/07/alternative-theory-of-gravity-makes-a-nearly-testable-prediction/"},{"by":"green-eclipse","descendants":142,"id":20438289,"kids":[20441906,20439173,20440179,20441893,20439508,20439327,20441873,20440695,20439306,20443080,20439551,20440488,20439468,20441288,20439888,20439736,20440032,20441739,20442350,20441952,20439475,20443327,20441025,20441955,20439254,20441072,20443250,20444591,20444335,20439547,20439394],"score":466,"time":1563167146,"title":"Florida DMV sells personal info to private companies, marketing firms","type":"story","url":"https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/local-news/i-team-investigates/i-team-florida-dmv-sells-your-personal-information-to-private-companies-marketing-firms"},{"by":"jonbaer","descendants":12,"id":20438288,"kids":[20438452,20438656,20438514,20438355],"score":36,"time":1563167146,"title":"Transparent aluminum–from Star Trek to (almost) reality","type":"story","url":"https://ceramics.org/ceramic-tech-today/ceramic-video/video-transparent-aluminum-from-star-trek-to-reality"},{"by":"onetimemanytime","descendants":15,"id":20438444,"kids":[20438639,20438650,20438646,20438682,20438617,20438598],"score":41,"time":1563169474,"title":"Urban heat island","type":"story","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_heat_island"},{"by":"prostoalex","descendants":214,"id":20438302,"kids":[20450647,20449562,20448662,20447944,20449424,20450024,20449648,20448400,20448012,20448910,20447813,20448196,20448985,20448146,20447725,20447796,20448270,20449290,20449004,20449723,20448657,20450578,20449110,20447809,20447939,20451386,20449717,20448347,20450464,20447760,20450208,20452635],"score":159,"time":1563167428,"title":"We can't get enough of audiobooks","type":"story","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/13/listen-up-rise-of-audiobooks-steven-poole"},{"by":"throwaway83945","descendants":68,"id":20438120,"kids":[20438366,20438287,20438250,20438243,20438217,20438230,20438345,20438338,20438144,20438381,20438320,20438185,20438347,20438362,20438305,20438306,20438311,20438307,20439732,20438298,20438171,20438349,20439403,20439611,20438295,20438257,20438261,20438194,20438163,20438278,20438212,20438274,20438202,20438254,20438176,20438198],"score":34,"text":"From now on I&#x27;ve made the conscious decision to stop joining meetings that requires installing the usual proprietary applications (Zoom, Skype, BlueJeans, etc).<p>I will accept joining Hangout calls even though it&#x27;s also proprietary, but at least it doesn&#x27;t require that I run a random executable on my personal computer.<p>Is anyone else also doing this?

Recently for a variety of reasons I&#x27;ve been thinking about selling to my partner and leaving to try something new. But I don&#x27;t feel like I fit well into many job descriptions.

I think that the most valuable skill I possess is that I can put together teams where people like to work for me and we get things done.

The way it works is pretty simple: censored users learn about a temporary proxy (a &#x27;snowflake&#x27;) from a broker (using domain fronting or other techniques) that they establish a connection with using WebRTC, the temporary proxy then transmits the requests to a bridge which then connects to the Tor network, the temporary proxy thus functions as a middle point between the censored user and the bridge &lt;=&gt; Tor network. The idea is that by getting a significantly large number of ever changing and decaying temporary proxies it will be hard for a single censor to keep track and block all of them.<p>As explained earlier, when you function as a snowflake proxy no exit traffic is generated at your level, you just transit traffic to a bridge which then connects to the Tor network. Hence there is no need to worry about which websites the clients are accessing through your proxy. Their visible browsing IP address will match their Tor exit node, not yours. In addition Snowflake&#x27;s strength comes from having a large pool of temporary proxies, so don&#x27;t forget to spread the word and have a maximum of people installing this addon!<p>-------<p>To learn more about Snowflake you can have a look at the following references:<p>* https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trac.torproject.org&#x2F;projects&#x2F;tor&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;doc&#x2F;Snowflake<p>* https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bamsoftware.com&#x2F;papers&#x2F;thesis&#x2F;#chap:snowflake<p>* https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keroserene.net&#x2F;snowflake&#x2F;technical&#x2F;","time":1563044764,"title":"Tell HN: Help censored users access Tor by installing a browser addon","type":"story"},{"by":"tomrod","descendants":2,"id":20429465,"kids":[20430557,20432352],"score":16,"time":1563042905,"title":"How the biggest decentralized social network is dealing with its Nazi problem","type":"story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20691957/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-gab-migration-fediverse-app-blocking"},{"by":"bored_hacker","descendants":90,"id":20429462,"kids":[20430098,20430303,20435592,20431695,20432697,20433844,20430064,20438664,20430822,20431830,20431863],"score":165,"time":1563042892,"title":"Avoiding Webscraping Throttling Using Python and Tor as a Proxy","type":"story","url":"https://boredhacking.com/tor-webscraping-proxy/"},{"by":"overthinkerJS","descendants":13,"id":20429434,"kids":[20430323,20430694,20430793,20430567,20431939,20430548],"score":20,"text":"I&#x27;ve been wanting to experiment with this for a while.

The way it works is pretty simple: censored users learn about a temporary proxy (a &#x27;snowflake&#x27;) from a broker (using domain fronting or other techniques) that they establish a connection with using WebRTC, the temporary proxy then transmits the requests to a bridge which then connects to the Tor network, the temporary proxy thus functions as a middle point between the censored user and the bridge &lt;=&gt; Tor network. The idea is that by getting a significantly large number of ever changing and decaying temporary proxies it will be hard for a single censor to keep track and block all of them.<p>As explained earlier, when you function as a snowflake proxy no exit traffic is generated at your level, you just transit traffic to a bridge which then connects to the Tor network. Hence there is no need to worry about which websites the clients are accessing through your proxy. Their visible browsing IP address will match their Tor exit node, not yours. In addition Snowflake&#x27;s strength comes from having a large pool of temporary proxies, so don&#x27;t forget to spread the word and have a maximum of people installing this addon!<p>-------<p>To learn more about Snowflake you can have a look at the following references:<p>* https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trac.torproject.org&#x2F;projects&#x2F;tor&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;doc&#x2F;Snowflake<p>*

I&#x27;ve been researching tech turnover for a bit now, with a focus on programmer turnover, and with no reservations I can say that so-called Agile project management is a leading cause.<p>The goal of Agile project management is to make software development a more customer-centric and more iterative. This is a noble goal. Agile however, whether intentionally or unintentionally, has had a secondary effect of robbing developers of job satisfaction.<p>Here let me give you an example. About 10 years ago I worked with somewhat of an influential in the Ruby community. We both worked at an &quot;Agile&quot; software consultancy. After finishing a task on our project work board I remember watching as that developer went back to claim the task the followed logically from what he just finished. He was shocked when he saw that the task&#x27;s card has been claimed by another. He then said, right there in the office, quite loudly and openly &quot;I am not getting the satisfaction of completing a thing when working like this.&quot;<p>So Agile robs developers of sense of satisfaction of ownership and completion. Well if the developer is being robbed of this satisfaction then to whom is this satisfaction being transferred? Well, project managers. Who get rewarded for the &quot;velocity&quot; of the team, which is more of a product of the hard work and less of a product of task management.<p>So developers have three things making them want out:<p>1) No ownership satisfaction\n2) No completion satisfaction\n3) Someone else taking credit for their work<p>Ok, this are not the only reasons for developer turn over but this is a big one. There are others like toxic environments, Title VII discrimination, and so on.<p>It can be denied that 1.5 - 2.0 year developer turnover at tech companies is pretty woeful. We are dropping the ball somewhere and its hurting business bottom lines and developer careers.","time":1562900816,"title":"Why I No Longer Want to Write Software for Companies That I Don't

Blockstack is a decentralized computing network. We currently have 165+ apps built on top (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blockstack.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blockstack.org</a>). Today we&#x27;re launching Stacks to the public, the first SEC-qualified crypto token offering.<p>First, a little about our journey: I grew up in Pakistan with a single state-controlled TV channel. I&#x27;ve been obsessed with the internet since the dial-up days of the late 90s. I researched computer networks as a grad student. I took a leave from Princeton in 2013 to start Blockstack with my co-founder. Our rather ambitious goal was to build a better internet. We went through YC in 2014 and have raised $50M in capital so far.<p>We believe that the &quot;traditional internet&quot; became dependent on a handful of companies. We want to take the internet back to its decentralized roots. We&#x27;ve done 4+ years of R&amp;D and infrastructure building. We&#x27;re focusing on giving developers the right tools to build decentralized apps. The big difference between these and traditional internet apps is that: \n(1) apps mostly run client-side (no servers or databases), \n(2) users are in control of their data with encrypted private data lockers, and \n(3) users have universal cryptographic logins without any third-party providers.<p>Blockstack PBC is a public benefit corporation. We build the core protocols and developer tools for decentralized computing. Developers use our open-source reference implementations and SDKs to build decentralized apps. These include Graphite (decentralized Google docs), Dmail (encrypted email), BitPatron (decentralized Patreon), and others (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.co&#x2F;blockstack\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.co&#x2F;blockstack</a>). The Blockstack software stack gives developers decentralized solutions for auth and storage. Further, developers can program smart contracts.<p>The Stacks blockchain is a foundational layer of our architecture. It executes smart contracts and enables our decentralized auth and storage to work without centralized operators. Users register their usernames on the Stacks blockchain and link their storage credentials. Technical details of our full decentralized computing stack are at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blockstack.org&#x2F;whitepaper.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blockstack.org&#x2F;whitepaper.pdf</a>.<p>Stacks is the native crypto token of Blockstack. Stacks are used as &quot;fuel&quot; to register digital assets and execute smart contracts. Compared to other decentralized app platforms like Ethereum or EOS, we:\n(1) keep on-chain logic to a minimum, \n(2) scale apps by localizing state changes, and\n(3) enable developers to write general-purpose apps, not just smart contracts.<p>Our regulatory approach is also very different from typical “ICOs” you may have seen. For distributing Stacks to the general public, we decided to work with US regulators. We wanted to open up the US market to our offering instead of blocking US investors. Yesterday, we received qualification from the SEC. The SEC has never qualified any token offering until now.<p>Regulation A is often compared to a “mini IPO.” Our filing has fully-audited financials and seeks to provide fully transparent disclosures. There were a lot of legal and accounting treatment questions that we had to work on with the SEC. It’s new territory for everyone. It took us almost ten months to reach this stage and we spent close to 2M USD in legal fees and other expenses. I joked at a recent event that I consider our expenditures a donation to the rest of the crypto industry. Other projects now have a legal framework for regulated crypto-token offerings.<p>I know that many on HN are skeptical of the cryptocurrency market, which has become over-hyped with many bad actors. We share a lot of those feelings. We want to build on solid scientific foundations and give developers the right tools for scalable decentralized apps. Alternatives to centralized big tech monopolies can and will, eventually, exist. The SEC-qualified token offering is our effort to help mature this industry.<p>You can find our SEC offering circular link at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackstoken.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackstoken.com</a>. We&#x27;d love to get feedback from the HN community on our regulatory framework and tech design. Thanks!<p>P.S: Given the regulated nature of this offering, I need to give disclaimers. Realize it’s not typical HN culture :-)<p>— Muneeb<p>Important disclaimer\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has qualified the offering statement that we have filed with the SEC.

This could also be used as a recovery method with self-sovereign identities.<p>The way it works it using escrowed payments to deter malicious recovery attempts. Any user may make an Escrovery challenge to recover any account by first placing an amount of money in escrow. If the original account owner responds to the challenge in a certain amount of time, they earn the escrow. Otherwise, the challenger takes ownership of the account and recovers their escrow.<p>The main limitation is that it requires users to be regularly active in checking for challenges to their account.

Tim and James and we’re building Cloosiv (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloosiv.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloosiv.com</a>), an order-ahead app for independent coffee shops.<p>We started working on this because we believe that coffee is the most overlooked sub-vertical in retail. Coffee is the most repeated purchase that Americans make every day, with over 220M cups purchased daily at coffee shops, cafes, bakeries and diners. Starbucks is the largest chain, but they only process 2.5% of those daily sales. It’s the 50,000 independent merchants across the U.S. that sell the largest percentage. Starbucks&#x27; order-ahead app is actually the most-used mobile payment app in the US—more than Apple Pay and Google Pay. Their users know that they can use the same mobile app at any Starbucks location. But the rest of the market, the other 97.5%, haven’t had a similar option. We’re focused on providing that experience across independent coffee shops in the US.<p>We consider the two of us meeting as our luckiest milestone to date. James had set out to build his own development agency at the same time that Tim was looking for help building v1 of Cloosiv. We met on Upwork and quickly realized that our skillsets complimented each other. That contract was James’ first and last while running his own agency.<p>Since our initial launch in 2018, we’ve processed over 35,000 orders for $250,000+ in revenue on behalf of our coffee shop partners, with orders and volume growing 40% monthly. Our network includes over 200 local coffee shops, with another 150+ locations currently onboarding. We’ve been able to win these early customers by building our product alongside them. In addition to gaining their trust, this process has resulted in features that set us apart from incumbent ordering options. For example, our merchants can log in from any device and make on-the-fly changes. If they’ve run out of almond milk, they can remove that option with a single click, so that customers can’t order almond milk and be disappointed when they arrive.<p>We&#x27;re sometimes asked: why is no one else doing this? There are many mobile ordering apps, but they&#x27;ve all but ignored the coffee market. This is probably because the average coffee receipt is so low in comparison to the merchants they typically support. Another reason is the level of specificity that’s required to win the support of coffee merchants, who are keenly aware of customer expectation when serving time-sensitive, hot-temperature items like espresso. It turns out that a good app for ordering pizza is not the same thing as a good app for ordering coffee. We’ve been able to win coffee shops by remaining focused on their market and its specific needs. This is an opportunity to build the most-used mobile payment option for the most commonly purchased commodity in the country.<p>Most of our current locations skew towards the east coast, because we’re based in Charlotte, NC and it’s where we gained initial traction. Our priority right now is to increase our presence on the west coast. If you wish your local coffee shop had an order ahead option, we’d really appreciate if you shared Cloosiv with them. We’re going to prioritize the most requested-by-HN shops for the next few weeks. You can submit a referral by clicking “Invite a Coffee Shop” on our website or in the app to get a $10 reward - mention Hacker News in the submission and we’ll do everything we can to get them on board!<p>We&#x27;d also love to hear your ideas and feedback about anything and everything in this space! If you want to check out the app, download Cloosiv on your Apple or Android device and if there’s a shop around you, enter promo code HN-2019 at checkout and get 50% off any item. Ok, that&#x27;s all from us. Please share your thoughts and ask any questions you’d like.","time":1562778058,"title":"Launch HN: Cloosiv (YC S19) – Order ahead from local coffee shops","type":"story"},{"by":"bradley_taunt","descendants":206,"id":20403375,"kids":[20403739,20405558,20403641,20403799,20404147,20403569,20403546,20403554,20403813,20405701,20403584,20405265,20404031,20403640,20403547,20405431,20417809,20404391,20403672,20405291,20405640,20406555,20405156,20403775,20410236,20406140,20404231,20405067,20407277,20416359,20403551,20404149,20403734,20403847,20403495,20403545,20403577,20403925,20403878],"score":431,"time":1562775374,"title":"Dear Google, I'm Blocking You from My Website","type":"story","url":"https://bradleytaunt.com/stop-crawling-google/"},{"by":"andrewstetsenko","descendants":9,"id":20403392,"kids":[20404240,20414021,20406789,20405741,20404219],"score":17,"time":1562775519,"title":"Show HN: WWBR – Who Wants to Be Relocated?

Freemium (for ever) + Paid plan with more functionalities -&gt; This one was quite popular 5-10 years ago. But I heard a lot of founders saying that SAAS should not do freemium, especially at the beginning. Because only paid customers matter and only paid customers confirm that your product is needed - the product market fit.<p>2. 7-14 days free trial then paid plan + Credit card required -&gt; Personally I hate companies requiring credit card for a free trial. I heard that this can result a hight churn rate as well. Benefit: It may get extra revenue because some users forgot to cancel their accounts.<p>3. 7-14 free trial then paid plan + credit card not required. Need some more insights about this one.

The hiring team should only do culture and personality fit, which will be the last phase.\n    2.

Since this 3rd-party will focus just on technical interviewing skills&#x2F;process, it will become expert in this domain.\n    6. Taking it further, the interview could be SAT&#x2F;GRE type score, valid for certain duration (3-6 months). Take the test, apply to various companies at your own pace.\n    7. Such standardized score could also help reduce size of target company, further saving candidate&#x27;s time.\n    8. May be candidate can opt for in-person interview and still get standardized score.\n    9. Since 3rd-party has no other thing but to interview, it should be able to provide whole gamut of options - in-person, online, whiteboard, with IDE, with vim, specialty topics, pick-your-own topics, etc. Hiring company set their criteria, candidates set their own and someone finds a match.\n\n</code></pre>\nProcess can be further tweaked in umpteen ways but will ensure a degree of standardization across industry.

I dropped my old laptop and broke the screen, the cost is over $500, so I sold it on eBay.  I loved that machine.  It worked fine and I was hesitant on new Macbook because of product quality concerns.<p>Also, I learn ML on the side.  CUDA seems to be the current popular tech for GPU-accelerated DL programming.  I have not used OpenCL much at all to know if Mac&#x27;s AMD can do the same or not.<p>So far, I think if I continue on studying ML, I&#x27;d better get a laptop with a good nvidia graphics card like MSI GS65 stealth with GTX 1070&#x2F;RTX 2070.  I&#x27;d use it for tuning models before pushing work to ec2 instance.  Macbook cannot do that.  Matlab also works a lot better on Windows.<p>I have hard time letting go Mac OS, however, like the old saying &quot;it just works.&quot; No BSOD, no crapware, blazing fast due to software optimization, clean packaging of applications, and I really like Scrivener, brew, and super-fantastic trackpad.  If I get a Mac again, it&#x27;s probably gonna be end of the year, because I&#x27;m waiting for the redesign and scissor switch keyboard.  I might either get a 13&quot; MBA, or 15&quot; MBP with maxed out specs.<p>Biggest thing that held me back from Windows laptop is also the quality control.  Granted, Macbook repair and Apple Care is not cheap at all.  Repairability of Mac sucks, but I have very bad experience with Windows laptop vendors, too, and windows laptops have much higher chance of breakage within 3 years in my experience.<p>Please give me your advice, assuming I can only get one of them... it&#x27;d be much appreciated.","time":1562602579,"title":"Ask HN: Is Macbook Pro or Gaming Laptop Better for Machine

It can be used for both mirroring and archiving backups, among other things.<p>It is light, very small and it is really quite fast. Half of the development time was sunk into the UI&#x2F;UX design, so there&#x27;s that too.<p>Existing version is a result of 5 years of a _very_ careful evolution, focusing more on perfecting existing features rather than adding new ones. Said No to more feature requests than I can remember. The blog captures some of that in a form of development screenshots, sketches and what not [1].<p>2. Secondly, I wanted to add an anecdotal data point that the desktop software development <i>is</i> still very much an option despite of all the nasty rumors. The demand for well-written Windows software is still there. The biggest takeaway has been that there is LOTS of people, on Windows, that recognize software quality as a feature. They acknowledge and compliment it, and they are actively looking for it.<p>That&#x27;s <i>the</i> niche. If you are thinking of trying the Windows ISV path, I&#x27;d aim there.<p><pre><code>    --\n</code></pre>\nBy the way of introduction - I&#x27;m in my mid 40s. I&#x27;ve been a programmer for my entire life, mostly on the sysdev side of things - firewalls, network stacks, VPNs, etc. - which is one of the reasons I still like things to be as small and as fast as possible. I&#x27;m also the original author of Hamachi VPN, there&#x27;s a chance you might&#x27;ve heard of it.<p>Any thoughts or comments on the program itself, would appreciate to hear them.

HN,\nI&#x27;m not very good at explaining things so bear with me.\nI&#x27;m posting this on hn because i don&#x27;t utilize any other means to communicate with internet strangers.<p>To begin with, i&#x27;m a 19yo male(ultra ambitious). I recently scored a job as Junior developer in a 5yo startup.I&#x27;m considered above average- with respect to intellect- by most people I&#x27;ve met(and i &#x27;was&#x27; really happy with that). My nature is very similar to a water droplet present in a void(lol).\nRecently i&#x27;ve been felling very uneasy when i get into thinking about myself with respect to the whole human tribe i.e. how do&#x2F;should i fit in. This habit of mine, although i&#x27;m not able to pinpoint the event of inception, afaict can be traced back to the period when i changed cities due to some financial problems my family was facing. I lost touch with most of the things i grew up with.\nI used to learn things very quickly, i&#x27;m also very good presenter. Whatever i try to learn something new i get distracted very easily. I think I&#x27;m not able to distinguish between my wants and needs. To be more simple i always feel like i&#x27;ve just opened my eyes in a dream - blurry and no control.

There&#x27;s no monetization strategy behind it (yet), and I very much like the idea of helping to facilitate the creation of little street communities.","time":1562314615,"title":"Show HN: Little site to help connect the people on your street together","type":"story"},{"by":"barry-cotter","descendants":139,"id":20360626,"kids":[20360967,20360981,20361591,20360814,20360921,20360856,20361082,20362728,20360951,20362910,20361697,20362051,20361601,20361143,20361303,20361915,20362275,20361520],"score":87,"time":1562312782,"title":"The heritability of fertility makes world population stabilization unlikely","type":"story","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513817302799#bb0180"},{"by":"polm23","descendants":41,"id":20360589,"kids":[20368236,20368305,20369998,20368422,20369035,20369031,20370470,20370358],"score":63,"time":1562312339,"title":"What Color Is Khaki, Anyway?","type":"story","url":"https://www.dampfkraft.com/what-color-is-khaki.html"},{"by":"kartikdoraha","dead":true,"id":20360543,"kids":[20360697,20360685],"score":6,"time":1562311854,"title":"Is it Helpful exercise to gain weight ?","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@fitnesshealthforever/5-ways-to-exercise-to-gain-weight-fitness-health-forever-eb4d8a566a2"},{"by":"woutgaze","descendants":190,"id":20360513,"kids":[20366525,20361218,20360892,20361475,20369086,20361404,20365901,20360657,20361379,20362279,20360993,20365922,20366131,20361141,20366802,20366530,20366656,20364631,20362097,20361238,20362437,20363685,20363645,20366346,20364854,20365990,20366784,20366375,20361425,20362859,20364986,20365221,20361087,20361781,20362554,20361344,20361662,20366209,20362250,20364980,20368156,20364998,20361701],"score":253,"time":1562311356,"title":"The most effective way to tackle climate change?

It has a few features my own team finds very useful (ex: a single person can mock a server and share it to the entire team, and updates then get synced automatically etc.) which reduce the overhead of maintaining the mock in sync with the actual API being built.<p>The product is split into an Electron app (fairly performant), and a web service which allows for teams to be created and mocked APIs shared.<p>So far, I&#x27;ve had an abysmal time marketing the service. My marketing strategy so far has been:<p>1. Posting to HN, Reddit (r&#x2F;programming and r&#x2F;programmingtools), Product Hunt, IndieHackers - Bad initial traction (the post on HN got buried), very few signups, quite a few downloads of which about 5% stuck around and still use the app.<p>2. Posting as a response to appropriate questions on stackoverflow - The four answers I wrote still net me about 10 visits a day.<p>3. Blogging on the official product blog - Pretty much nobody reads this, I&#x27;ve tried cross posting to r&#x2F;programming but generally not very receptive over there.<p>That said, based on my own teams usage, and the usage of a few teams we have gotten to use through word of mouth is quite positive and it has quickly become an integral tool. So I&#x27;m not really willing to give up on it yet.<p>So how should I get more developers to try out and use the tool? How do I market this tool to developers? Should I be trying to go after Engineering Managers instead?<p>Thanks in advance for your help.<p>EDIT: It&#x27;s called Mocktastic.

Then, I bought (legally! from a licensed pharmacy) some THC capsules and some CBD capsules. I took a THC capsule around 4pm and waited to feel its effects (&quot;around two hours after ingestion&quot;). Sure enough, 1h50min after I started to feel different - but it wasn&#x27;t AT ALL what I was expecting: the sensations were 100% physical and extremely unpleasant. I had very specific paresthesias, that I could only describe as icy-cold(!) electric discharges through my arms, forearms and ring fingers, behind my knees and, the strangest of them all, inside my stomach. There was nothing even resembling euphoria (or anxiety), just physical sensations. At one point I got up (I was lying on the couch, watching something on TV) and went to the bathroom, because I was feeling nauseous and I was afraid I was going to throw up. I felt dizzy and I had trouble with my equilibrium. I didn&#x27;t throw up and I returned on the couch and closed my eyes, trying to fall asleep. It didn&#x27;t happen and I had to soldier on through three more hours of very unpleasant, exclusively physical sensations. Honestly, it felt like I was terminally ill and I was about to expire (again: I knew it was not going to happen, I wasn&#x27;t anxious or anything, just enduring a maximal physical discomfort).<p>The next day I tried to find similar experience on the web. I wasn&#x27;t able to.

It was acrimonious.<p>She continued to the run the company and raised a few more rounds of funding. We haven&#x27;t spoken since, I get minimal updates, just things related to funding rounds. I have no idea on the financial status of the business.<p>The last round was completed a week ago and I got an email from an existing investor with an offer to buy my shares at the valuation of the round that just closed. It is a decent amount of money, one that would put me in a much better financial position.<p>I feel in a huge lose lose situation.

We&#x27;re Tejas and Kashish, co-founders of Carry (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;carry.travel\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;carry.travel</a>).<p>Carry is your executive assistant for travel. Just message us (i.e. &quot;I need to be in Boston for a meeting at 2pm on July 1st&quot;), and we&#x27;ll get everything done for you— flights, trains, cars, hotels, Airbnbs... you name it. Carry is not a chat bot— we function like a traditional agency with in-house travel agents, but unlike traditional travel agencies that use terminals (similar to Bloomberg in Finance) or manually search websites like Expedia, we&#x27;re building in-house tools to make our agents&#x27; jobs easier and help them work faster. Imagine automatically going from a customer message (&quot;I need to be in Boston Tuesday for a 10am meeting and return for a 9am meeting Friday&quot;) to parsed trip requirements (from: SFO, to: BOS, arrive by: 10am, return by: 9am) that are then merged with your calendar and user preferences to search all data sources. Our agents then interpret the results and propose options to the user. Over time, we want to add more automation and intelligence using each user interaction as training data (but first we need volume... lol).<p>We built Carry because we hate booking travel— it&#x27;s just way too time-consuming and inefficient. It&#x27;s tedious to check multiple sites (Skiplagged, Google Flights, Skyscanner, etc.) before finding the cheapest price, filling out all of the airline information, and then, searching for a place to stay. And, even when you have all the information, choice paralysis prevails.<p>9 months ago, we set out to build a chat bot because we asked ourselves &quot;Why can&#x27;t Siri book travel?&quot; Working backwards, we quickly realized why bots don&#x27;t work— they&#x27;re robotic, formulaic, and take lots of back and forth to convey what you want. We also realized that consumers don&#x27;t know what they want, which makes it really hard to choose travel options for them. With these learnings in mind, we looked to corporate travel agencies for inspiration.<p>It turns out 70% of corporate travel is booked without any tool or agency— employees book their own travel and expense it. The other 30% uses tools at two ends of the spectrum— 1 old school travel agencies (think phone calls) 2) new-age corporate travel portals (imagine a clunky, worse Google Flights). We found that no one actually wants to use these tools— they just have to, and that the only people who were satisfied with the state of things were folks who had assistants they could offload the work onto.<p>Thus, we decided we&#x27;d create an assistant for everyone. Carry is the first travel tool built for employees-first. Employees get all the points, all the options, and the ability to save time an assistant provides. So far, we&#x27;ve been working with corporations directly, but today, we&#x27;re doing a soft launch of Carry for individuals with a waitlist at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;carry.travel\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;carry.travel</a>. That said, for the HN community, just email me (tejas [at] carry [dot] travel) if you want to start using us for work immediately.<p>If you travel frequently (or even if you don&#x27;t!), we&#x27;d love to hear about the inefficiencies and pain points you&#x27;ve experienced while traveling that you wish a product like Carry could solve. We want to hear your feedback on the product and work with you all to develop features to save even more time.","time":1562088080,"title":"Launch HN: Carry (YC S19) – We Book Travel for You on

How are organizations like this structured?<p>For example, you&#x27;ve grown organically to about 20 engineers involved in a single shipping software product. You plan to grow the team to 50, so you know you&#x27;ll need a handful of teams. There are no clear architectural boundaries (client&#x2F;server) that make the decision obvious. Most new features that need to be built require touching many parts of the code (frontend, backend, integrations, documentation). You only know you need to grow the engineering team because there&#x27;s a never-ending list of features &amp; enhancements you&#x27;d like to make.<p>For the AWS development teams, for example, it seems obvious there would be division around products - this team looks after S3, that team looks after DynamoDB. But what happens if the S3 team is itself 30 developers and needs to be divided up? How do you decide which team owns what?<p>I&#x27;d appreciate any real-world examples of insights on this. Not so much what the teams do (we all do standups, etc.), but how they drew the boundaries in the first place. Deciding 5-12 people teams is the optimum size feels like deciding the ideal electorate constituency is 100,000 people; the devil is actually drawing the boundaries on the map.","time":1562071132,"title":"Ask HN: How are large software teams split up?","type":"story"},{"by":"seanballais","descendants":3,"id":20334347,"kids":[20336092,20335945],"score":4,"text":"Link to article: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;oracle&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;01&#x2F;venkat-subramaniam-kotlin-and-python-are-fun-but-java-developers-are-semantically-aligned--with-the-future&#x2F;#37fde0805d04<p>What does Venkat Subramaniam mean by &quot;Java Developers Are Semantically Aligned With The Future&quot;?

Not married. I&#x27;ve spent the last 3 years working at a FAANG company - more or less right out of college. For the first 2.5 years I lived at home with my parents. As such, I&#x27;ve saved quite a bit. Now I&#x27;m living in the city. With recent changes to my team goals and product, I find myself extremely unfulfilled as of late. I now regularly engage in fantasies of quitting, and my gut tells me it&#x27;s the right call.<p>I&#x27;ve always had personal projects I work on. Mostly ones that are intended to make a tiny bit of passive income. No one-hit wonders. But none of them have seen the light of day. I lose interest half way through. In my time off, I would like to finish one of them.<p>I&#x27;m somewhat risk averse, so I would only allow myself to go 6 months before trying to find another job (provided I can&#x27;t come up with any solo income in that time). I hold no belief that I&#x27;ll make a profitable project being solo. I don&#x27;t fantasize about being a startup founder who makes millions. I just want some time to work on projects I enjoy. Maybe make some money off them. Probably not.<p>USEFUL INFO:<p>* Rent + everything else = ~4k a month. I can get that lower.<p>* I have 275k in savings. Not counting 401k.<p>* 6mo would cost about 25k.<p>* My lease is up for renew in 6mo, which is a nice coincidence.<p>* Got promoted in the last 6 months. This may help job prospects in the future - companies may more easily hire me at that level, than if I quit without getting promoted.<p>RISKS:<p>1) Sucking it up and working at this company the next 8 years would result in a very lucrative career, and that&#x27;s a large opportunity cost.<p>2) Getting a job 6 months from now may not be as easy as I pretend it is. (What if the economy explodes!)<p>3) I may find that I have motivation for personal projects either, and live 6 months in a quiet depression in my underwear.<p>ALTERNATIVES:<p>1) I suck it up and do my job. People would love this job. It&#x27;s cushy and it pays very well. Just do it for 5 more years and then consider this stuff.<p>2) Change teams at work. I imagine this might be only a mitigation, but maybe it would make things better.<p>3) Talk to my manager about working on stuff that I want to. I love to create and experiment. I know our problem area well now. I have things I want to create that would be valuable to the company that I would be passionate about. Would it be wise to ask for a 3 month trial of working on my own solo thing within the company? I would like that.<p>So what do you think?

The company offers digital product development and marketing services to clients across non-profit, healthcare and higher education sectors. It created Wagtail, the popular open source CMS now used by the NHS, NASA and Google. The founders first revealed plans to staff in March and expect the sale process to complete on the 28th June 2019.<p>Torchbox’s employees, who will receive a tax-free bonus of up to £3,600 every year as part of the deal, have elected a Trust of Directors from the existing workforce. The Trust will work alongside Torchbox’s Directors to oversee strategy and growth, with an emphasis on ensuring that the business’s sense of purpose and values remains paramount.<p>Torchbox founders Olly and Tom will be part of the Trust for five years, until their majority stake is repaid by the business. Staff will eventually be able to decide how to direct agency profits and will continue to input into the running of the business via the Trust, in a model similar to that of the John Lewis Partnership.<p>“When we were considering the future of Torchbox, we thought about the importance of retaining our independent spirit, continuing our fast growth and empowering our brilliant team to take an active part in our business,” explained Olly Willans. “We decided that by far the best people to own Torchbox are the people who have made it the success it is today, and the people who will continue to make it a success tomorrow. If we were going to choose employee ownership, then we wanted to commit to it entirely without maintaining any kind of minority shareholding.”","time":1561720917,"title":"Not selling up","type":"story","url":"https://torchbox.com/blog/not-selling-up/"},{"by":"qndev","descendants":12,"id":20303172,"kids":[20303692,20306000],"score":70,"time":1561720564,"title":"VLC media player 3.0.6 and earlier: Read buffer overflow and double free","type":"story","url":"https://www.videolan.org/security/sa1901.html"},{"by":"fraqed","descendants":15,"id":20303127,"kids":[20307241,20305560,20304696,20303237,20303971,20305206,20307172,20304293],"score":50,"time":1561720005,"title":"Eve Online is in chaos after an unprecedented alien invasion","type":"story","url":"https://www.pcgamer.com/eve-online-is-in-chaos-after-an-unprecedented-alien-invasion/"},{"by":"zerogvt","descendants":215,"id":20303029,"kids":[20303594,20303801,20304714,20303461,20304028,20306465,20306776,20306816,20305636,20303764,20310394,20303958,20312447,20305036,20304114,20303424,20303935,20303768,20303482,20305374,20303466,20303894,20307781,20303700],"score":424,"time":1561718395,"title":"US military is a bigger polluter than as many as 140 countries","type":"story","url":"https://theconversation.com/us-military-is-a-bigger-polluter-than-as-many-as-140-countries-shrinking-this-war-machine-is-a-must-119269"},{"by":"pseudolus","descendants":97,"id":20302872,"kids":[20308970,20308612,20307740,20308443,20308288,20308310,20307745,20307080,20306995,20307351,20309635,20309309,20306770,20308720,20308430,20315568,20309409,20307249],"score":64,"time":1561716289,"title":"SpaceX faces daunting challenges if it’s going to win the internet space race","type":"story","url":"https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-spacex-starlink-constellation-20190628-story.html"},{"by":"lekorotkov","descendants":9,"id":20302934,"kids":[20303498,20302980,20303871],"score":7,"text":"I&#x27;m thinking about preparing a new project.

Also having to configure your editor to indent correctly and the creation of many indentation rules. It makes reaching the &quot;80 character limit&quot; come much faster depending on how you indent code and pushes code off over your screen so you have to use line wrap or scroll sideways.<p>I was thinking, why not instead of indenting the code we could not indent the code and leave it to the editor to handle formatting it visually.<p>Now any editor will be able to parse this and display it how I would like. Say I prefer 2 space indentation it can do that instead of 8 which others prefer.

So we went ahead and made it ourselves :)<p>I know that other great resources such as OpenAi&#x27;s spinning up have come out since then, but we would like to present our work and open source it to the community. We hope this content inspires someone out there to do great things!<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.starai.io&#x2F;<p>.","time":1561644359,"title":"StarAi: Deep Reinforcement Learning Course","type":"story"},{"by":"jfk13","descendants":7,"id":20294345,"kids":[20297015,20297048,20296821,20297581],"score":21,"time":1561643720,"title":"'Shocking' Fake Takeaway Sold on Uber Eats","type":"story","url":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-48762211/shocking-fake-takeaway-sold-on-uber-eats"},{"by":"qndev","descendants":55,"id":20294338,"kids":[20296435,20295475,20297031,20298074,20294953,20294678,20302331,20295303],"score":85,"time":1561643695,"title":"RPM Packages Explained","type":"story","url":"https://fedoramagazine.org/rpm-packages-explained/"},{"by":"gwintrob","descendants":2,"id":20294414,"kids":[20294664,20294469],"score":3,"time":1561644150,"title":"Would You Pay $30 a Month to Check Your Email?","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/technology/superhuman-email.html%20https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/technology/superhuman-email.html"},{"by":"classichasclass","descendants":15,"id":20294261,"kids":[20297924,20294353,20295439,20296941,20295431,20295615],"score":76,"time":1561643110,"title":"The hard way to recover the IBM 5100 Non-executable ROS","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/stepleton/5100NonExecutableROSDecode/blob/master/WRITEUP.md"},{"by":"mampagoa","descendants":2,"id":20294061,"kids":[20294441,20294435],"score":1,"time":1561641293,"title":"How to find the size of an array in C without sizeof","type":"story","url":"https://arjunsreedharan.org/post/69303442896/array-in-c"},{"by":"tosh","descendants":9,"id":20294018,"kids":[20295148,20296151,20295586,20308506,20308492],"score":50,"time":1561640924,"title":"Dijkstra Archive (1930-2002)","type":"story","url":"http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/"},{"by":"SunTzu9087","descendants":15,"id":20293984,"kids":[20294172,20294889,20294639,20297022,20294225,20322505,20294125],"score":27,"time":1561640638,"title":"Facebook Starting Salaries: What Tech Professionals Can Expect","type":"story","url":"https://insights.dice.com/2019/06/27/facebook-starting-salaries-tech/"},{"by":"saravana85","descendants":47,"id":20293922,"kids":[20294318,20294092,20294359,20294278,20294104,20294073,20294673,20294925,20294571],"score":35,"time":1561639951,"title":"Britain adopts 2050 net zero emissions target","type":"story","url":"https://phys.org/news/2019-06-britain-net-emissions.html"},{"by":"xd1936","descendants":73,"id":20293897,"kids":[20294798,20294483,20294178,20295749,20298478,20295183,20294747,20296788],"score":123,"time":1561639721,"title":"Cypherpunks Tapping Bitcoin via Ham Radio","type":"story","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/cypherpunks-bitcoin-ham-radio/"},{"by":"graeme","descendants":244,"id":20293887,"kids":[20294408,20294590,20294438,20294489,20294362,20294888,20294535,20295497,20294351,20294381,20294361,20298778,20294683,20295166,20295921,20295250,20294569,20298206,20300766,20294531,20294682,20295247,20294579,20294714,20296686,20294507,20295729,20294538,20294770,20300179,20298488,20295274,20299284,20299703,20303809,20294375,20294553,20294516,20305426,20296347,20294558,20300200,20296534,20295810,20301260,20298212,20294548],"score":217,"time":1561639622,"title":"The Popularity of the 4.7″ iPhone","type":"story","url":"https://david-smith.org/blog/2019/06/24/the-popularity-of-the-4-dot-7-inch-iphone/"},{"by":"wishrider","descendants":5,"id":20293883,"kids":[20297791,20293911],"score":3,"time":1561639600,"title":"Show HN: RaaS – Roasting as a Service","type":"story","url":"https://feedbacktoaster.com/"},{"by":"starman100","descendants":55,"id":20293904,"kids":[20300794,20294263,20294222,20294630,20294321,20294476,20294238,20294344,20294267,20294771,20294204,20294443,20294418],"score":52,"time":1561639770,"title":"Contributing to OSS considered “dangerous advice”","type":"story","url":"https://twitter.com/KatieFujihara/status/1144001204248125440"},{"by":"barry-cotter","descendants":136,"id":20293908,"kids":[20294368,20296665,20294556,20295058,20294432,20294578,20296331,20295061,20294552,20294642,20294528,20294245,20296168,20295678,20296436,20294288,20294280,20294835,20297833,20296847,20295165,20294470,20294513,20294717,20296230,20294379,20295417],"score":239,"time":1561639802,"title":"How Bad Are Things?

She&#x27;s proud of her success and does a pretty good job juggling that and family life.<p>We have two young kids.<p>I realized I have an issue with my wife&#x27;s job, feeling like it takes priority over our family. I feel I sacrifice small things regularly to allow her extra freedom for her job. I feel she budgets a disproportionate amount of energy and focus on her job, ignoring or putting off family-related duties or obligations that have a negative effect on the entire family.<p>When I think about my wife and her career, I&#x27;m proud of her success and I don&#x27;t think I have any issue with her earning more than me or having a &quot;better title.&quot; But I seem to have some issue with feeling less important than her job because I get annoyed when I feel that way. She tells me I&#x27;m unsupportive of her because I&#x27;m jealous of her success, but I just feel like I&#x27;m fighting for some respect for myself and I worry about a slippery slope of further sacrifice.<p>When we started dating, my side gigs got in the way of our dating lifestyle -- meaning it wasn&#x27;t totally acceptable for me to spend hours on nights and weekends doing contract work. The income was not necessary, so I slowly let it fade away. It was never something I felt actively bitter about, but no doubt it was a sacrifice I made to have more time for her. It comes up now because when she needs extra support for her job, it&#x27;s at my expense, and if I give her grief for that, I&#x27;m being unsupportive.<p>I&#x27;m realizing that what I&#x27;m dealing with might be a somewhat recent phenomenon, but also probably fairly common these days. I really do want my wife to be successful and happy, but I also don&#x27;t want to be required to live with this feeling of sacrifice.

Most of the time I was on-site, living in hotels, short-term rentals etc. and returning back home every or every other weekend. Remote jobs, at least in Germany, are very scarce or pay a lot less in contrast to on-site. I really liked to discover the Cities and the surrounding areas in my spare time past working hours, and I wonder if there is a way to do this in an international context.<p>Now, I found some websites like jobbatical.com which seem to promote these kind of job adverts, but in detail it is just regular job adverts of companies looking for permanent placements. I&#x27;m rather looking for a mutual agreement where both sides - employer and employee - agree beforehand on the temporary nature of the arrangement. Given a certain seniority&#x2F;expert level, I am pretty convinced these kinds of short term employments are benefical to the hiring company (thats also why at least in Germany we have a very vivid freelancer on-site market).<p>TLDR: Do you know any jobboards, websites, forums where companies explicitly look for (senior) level IT experts (software engineering etc.) and are open to temporary

This is the conclusion I have drawn after spending far to much time researching articles and academic papers theorizing why tech turnover is so high. There are 2 reason actually:<p>1. Companies over hype the position (like requiring an Architect&#x27;s training when the job really requires a construction worker). The Architect will likely leave the job in 1.5 years (which is the average turnover rate at many tech companies)<p>2. Trust between companies and tech developers is low. Tech environments are pretty hostile at times and developers absorb all of this. They wait for employers to address these problems but only receive lip service and wishful thinking. Trust devolves.

Here are all the apps that have asked me for bluetooth permission in the two days since I installed iOS 13:<p>Amazon (Already has location allowed)<p>Amazon Alexa (Already has location allowed)<p>ESPN<p>Facebook<p>Feit Electric<p>GasBuddy (I already gave it permission for location services)<p>Google Maps (already has location allowed)<p>Wear OS<p>YouTube<p>YT Kids<p>Hulu<p>Downcast<p>Netflix (Already has location allowed)<p>Sonos<p>Spotify (Already has location allowed)<p>Snapchat (Already has location allowed)<p>Waze (Already has location allowed)<p>PBS Kids (Already has location allowed)","time":1561398124,"title":"Ask HN: Why do so many apps on my iPhone need bluetooth?","type":"story"},{"by":"bruceb","descendants":172,"id":20266463,"kids":[20267120,20267546,20268201,20267066,20270762,20266862,20267124,20266613,20266716,20266745,20267277,20266806,20267223,20269055,20267176,20367190,20269320,20266810,20268969,20269120,20273263,20310489,20320815,20269325,20268147,20268899,20273456,20266969,20268717,20274952,20267077,20266709,20266951,20270175,20274877,20268644,20362565,20267243,20267501,20267846,20267020,20277980,20266582,20272574,20274738,20273211,20271233,20270589,20266905,20268917,20275500,20267022,20273896,20291446,20271740,20271335,20270734,20266717,20267308,20267282,20266592,20268702,20280049,20277063,20271487,20301410,20272080,20271830,20269146,20269987,20267126,20266881,20266548,20269107,20271360,20266805,20272847,20284643,20271373,20266748],"score":141,"text":"For all HNers seeking a cofounder\nPro tip: Leave contact info in profile, not everyone sees post the same day","time":1561399387,"title":"Ask HN: Who is seeking a cofounder?","type":"story"},{"by":"pain_perdu","descendants":2,"id":20266162,"kids":[20266503,20267241],"score":2,"text":"So two of my oldest friends&#x2F;(former colleges) in tech recently approached me for advice:  They have exited the 9-figure ARR SaaS app they built from scratch and asked me how likely it would be to find a an early-to-mid-stage startup that would consider hiring a senior team of 7 devs (avg. 10 years experience specially in high-scalability, AI and low-level coding) as a package deal (they have been working together for a long time and want to keep doing so).<p>Is this incredibly unorthodox or if the talent and team are sufficient good are there some companies out there that would consider them all together?

My contention is that the potential for all of you to help patients is massive, but almost entirely unmet. Part of the reason is that the two ways of looking at problems are so different.<p>One idea I have for a theme is to explain how a relentless focus on an individual patient, as opposed to a focus on larger systems, vastly simplifies the problem. It turns out that a laser focus on the patient in front of you, as opposed to grand plans to revamp all of healthcare, powerfully clarifies the path forward. An example would be a truly clear, correct and comprehensive personal medical record tied to the patient and marked by a national patient ID; not a toy product like some that have been offered for smartphones, but an industrial strength, single authoritative repository of every aspect of the patient’s health and care. This would stand independent of particular hospital systems, etc. Review of a patient’s history should be a fascinating unspooling of their story that can be flexibly explored in time and space (body part) interactively. A beautiful graphical interface is paramount. If you think that current EMRs do this, you haven’t worked in health care. Doctors and others spend an enormous amount of time simply to get the story straight. Many errors arise from the difficulties of this.<p>What kind of book about this topic do you think you would find most helpful and practical, or perhaps more importantly, inspiring?  What would you like to ask doctors about their work? \nHow can doctors most effectively work with you?<p>There is an amazing opportunity for you to help patients. Don’t get discouraged.

We use dynamic instrumentation libraries that monitor web applications internals to detect security anomalies and block triggered vulnerabilities at runtime. Pretty much what an Application Performance Management tool (like New Relic) is doing, but for security.<p>Before founding Sqreen, I led the Red Team (Offensive Security team) at Apple. I was brought on in 2006, so we&#x27;re talking iMacs and iTunes at the time. The focus was initially on breaking DRM implementations (FairPlay). Over time, I had a team of 4-5 people, and had to cover most of Apple&#x27;s portfolio. We needed to provide security assessments to hundreds of developers at Apple in ways that they could trust and find useful. We faced two major issues time and time again: scale (single digit team serving hundreds), and usefulness (how could we make security something that devs felt was actionable and relevant for them?). So why were these obstacles so hard to overcome?<p>First, security culture is broken. My team and I had to act in secrecy for years - like most security teams in companies. Our job was to break things (and we did a pretty good job there!), but we were mainly blockers instead of enablers. As is the norm, the way things were set up, our job was to say &quot;no&quot; - for the sake of product security—not to work collaboratively with developers on improving security together.<p>Second, most of the tools the industry is using today were invented in the 90&#x27;s and haven&#x27;t changed much since. Legacy security solutions rely on lists of known signatures of attacks that can&#x27;t keep up and that generate a high number of false positives. They slow down releases and are nearly impossible to properly maintain for security teams.<p>The function of security within companies today is where Ops was 15 years ago, before the DevOps &quot;revolution&quot;. \nSecurity as a function has yet to make the leap that Ops has. For small and mid-sized teams, security is either not present, or is bottlenecked by a one or two person team. For large companies, their security teams are flooded by irrelevant security alerts. And there aren&#x27;t enough security professionals to improve the situation by just increasing headcount.<p>We saw a need for a self-service solution that brings security and developers closer together, so that security can better scale and become more useful for developers. My co-founder JB and I started Sqreen to build that solution.<p>Sqreen&#x27;s microagent is a lightweight library that can be added in just a few commands to any web application, API, or microservice. We support Ruby, Node, PHP, Go, Java and Python.\nOur microagents use dynamic instrumentation [1] to automatically monitor sensitive app routines (Database calls, I&#x2F;O processing, rendering of pages and more) and they use the execution context of the app to identify how the request is being processed and detect if it&#x27;s triggering a vulnerability. The attack can be blocked at runtime (stopping the execution) and stack traces are provided on a dashboard. We embed a sandboxed VM inside the applications, so the CPU footprint is limited and we can&#x27;t mess up with the app.\nSqreen is built as a platform and security modules like Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP), in-app WAF, or account takeover can be turned on or off.<p>We protect over 600 companies in production today. We&#x27;ve blocked SQL injections just hours after being deployed, we&#x27;ve identified massive account takeover tentatives, we&#x27;re helping engineering teams with no security resources kickstart their security efforts, and we&#x27;re helping security teams scale their security efforts without slowing down developers.<p>We would love to hear your feedback about Sqreen, as well as answer any questions you might have!<p>[1] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.sqreen.com&#x2F;building-a-dynamic-instrumentation-agent-for-node-js&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.sqreen.com&#x2F;building-a-dynamic-instrumentation-a...</a>","time":1560878024,"title":"Launch HN: Sqreen (YC W18) – Securing Web Apps","type":"story"},{"by":"HillaryBriss","descendants":186,"id":20215382,"kids":[20216963,20216365,20216076,20215571,20215943,20215680,20216596,20217027,20216188,20216853,20215829,20215966,20216887,20216163,20216162,20217415,20216490,20215566,20215899,20215840,20216515,20215916,20216145,20216089],"score":172,"time":1560877622,"title":"China’s 'Thought Transformation' Camps [video]","type":"story","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-china-48667221/inside-china-s-thought-transformation-camps"},{"by":"gok","descendants":39,"id":20215331,"kids":[20218227,20217644,20216398,20217810,20215779,20221149,20218960],"score":85,"time":1560877438,"title":"Backpage.com’s Vicious Battle with the Feds","type":"story","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/inside-backpage-vicious-battle-feds/"},{"by":"acolytic","descendants":18,"id":20215292,"kids":[20215856,20215874,20215918,20219648,20217710,20221308,20215996,20219610,20219735,20215754,20215804,20216816],"score":23,"text":"One of the things I keep reading about functional languages is how they make reasoning about code easier and how this is particularly useful for distributed systems.

post really interested me.<p>I asked a fellow HackerNews reader (Rod Fitzsimmons Frey) for his thoughts on the post. He kindly responded with the following outline of steps:<p>- Capture of CO2 from the atmosphere using a variety of techniques, usually adsorption (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Carbon_capture_and_storage). This takes quite a bit of energy.<p>- Conversion of the dissolved CO2 into alcohols. Reaction is 2CO2 + 9H2O + 12e-  →  C2H5OH + 12OH- so it&#x27;s energy-uphill and needs an energy input. Maybe solar cells or a wind turbine. Requires a catalyst, often a variety of copper matrix. Catalysts are the major subject of research. To figure out whether you could do this in your garage you&#x27;d probably need to go to the literature.<p>- Distillation of the alcohols - usually done with heat, requires 800-900 deg C. Possible but hard and energy intensive. This is where Prometheus sits, they have a nanoscale membrane that does room-temperature separation of the alcohols using electricity input (more energy in!)<p>- Conversion of the alcohols into gasoline, diesel, kerosene etc. This is a pretty well-known process that uses a catalyst called ZSM-5 plus heat (mo&#x27; mo&#x27; energy!). I haven&#x27;t looked into the chemistry or the availability of the catalyst.<p>I think it&#x27;s pretty clear that... it&#x27;s most likely not possible to convert C02 into gasoline without using more energy + money than it would take to just go buy a $2.69&#x2F;gallon of 87 unleaded.<p>However, what is possible&#x2F;makes sense at a consumer level? In a modern day society where more and more individuals are learning the impact of climate change, I feel like any form of CO2 recapture + distillation would be a solid business idea from a &quot;demand&quot; standpoint.","time":1560826910,"title":"Ask HN: Does hobbyist-level C02 recapture make sense?","type":"story"},{"by":"syquek","descendants":2,"id":20209469,"kids":[20210245,20218016],"score":9,"time":1560827421,"title":"A man ate 'expired' food for a year","type":"story","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/06/17/this-man-ate-expired-food-year-heres-why-expiration-dates-are-practically-meaningless"},{"by":"Correly","descendants":7,"id":20209398,"kids":[20275956,20215042,20214211,20220816,20210249],"score":26,"time":1560826336,"title":"Show HN: Correly – Interactive Video Demos","type":"story","url":"http://www.correly.com"},{"by":"guyhance","descendants":1,"id":20209133,"kids":[20210030,20221294],"score":13,"time":1560822376,"title":"Cloudflare launches League of Entropy: distributed random number generator","type":"story","url":"https://blog.cloudflare.com/league-of-entropy/"},{"by":"huntermeyer","descendants":11,"id":20209005,"kids":[20209568,20209492,20209324,20209196],"score":31,"time":1560820817,"title":"Improving Security and Privacy for Extensions Users","type":"story","url":"https://security.googleblog.com/2019/06/improving-security-and-privacy-for.html"},{"by":"cardamomo","descendants":1,"id":20209076,"kids":[20209113,20209181],"score":14,"time":1560821721,"title":"Bill Nye on climate change: 'It’s not 50 to 75 years away–it’s 10 or 15' [video]","type":"story","url":"http://www.msnbc.com/velshi-ruhle/bill-nye-climate-change-its-not-50-75-years-away-its-10-or-15"},{"by":"blondie9x","descendants":10,"id":20208965,"kids":[20213459,20209194,20209271],"score":27,"time":1560820323,"title":"What Chinese Citizens Have and Haven’t Learned About Hong Kong’s Protests","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-17/china-censors-turn-the-blame-for-hong-kong-protests-to-the-u-s"},{"by":"sohkamyung","descendants":3,"id":20208880,"kids":[20209919,20211882,20210213],"score":6,"time":1560819436,"title":"Dogs’ Eyes Have Changed Since Humans Befriended Them","type":"story","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/06/domestication-gave-dogs-two-new-eye-muscles/591868/"},{"by":"marklyck","dead":true,"id":20208885,"kids":[20209015,20209209],"score":4,"time":1560819469,"title":"Robo Advisor beats Warren Buffet with a +90% win rate","type":"story","url":"https://weeklystocktip.com"},{"by":"stevenjohns","descendants":9,"id":20208752,"kids":[20208797,20208802,20208822,20223221,20208801],"score":1,"text":"I&#x27;m currently in the market for a new device.

I maybe should have, but it was bad enough I had to live through these moments once, I didn&#x27;t want to have to relive them by listening through them again to add in the beeps. Some people may get mad at me for giving away their company&#x27;s interview details, but it is what it is.<p>The main reason why I&#x27;m posting them is because there&#x27;s this myth that is commonly spoken about on the internet that the unemployment rate is at an all time low, and that companies are <i>dying</i> to hire developers, and if you&#x27;re a developer with basic skills and a few years of experience, they you&#x27;ll be flooded with job offers. Hopefully these recordings will put an end to those myths. No one is throwing jobs at me, as these recordings make very clear. It is also very clear that the burden is on <i>me</i> to prove to the company that I&#x27;m the person they should hire, not on the company to convince me to work for their company.<p>By the way, not s single one of these phone screens have lead to a job offer. Most of these screens are with startup companies, but some of them are established companies as well.<p>About half way through these recordings, I began the habit of asking how many people the company has interviewed before me. In very few cases do they say that they&#x27;ve interviewed less than 10 people.

Does borrowing become second-nature, or does it remain a tradeoff?","time":1560564908,"title":"Ask HN: Rust – does it get better?","type":"story"},{"by":"aswinmohanme","descendants":67,"id":20188022,"kids":[20188705,20188305,20188414,20188274,20188307,20188229,20188481,20189144,20188272,20190909,20188504,20190213,20189363,20189599,20188735,20188582,20189011,20188515,20188350],"score":267,"time":1560564284,"title":"Google refunded $200 because I missed 5 lines of Code","type":"story","url":"https://aswinmohanme.github.io/why-google-refunded-200-because-i-missed-5-lines-of-code.html"},{"by":"carbocation","descendants":26,"id":20187941,"kids":[20189627,20189025,20188654,20189333,20190199,20191610],"score":38,"time":1560562863,"title":"Prototype of clinical trials in an untrustworthy environment using blockchain","type":"story","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08874-y"},{"by":"hhs","descendants":4,"id":20187985,"kids":[20188658,20189895,20188471],"score":40,"time":1560563637,"title":"How we tune out distractions","type":"story","url":"http://news.mit.edu/2019/how-brain-ignores-distractions-0612"},{"by":"erickhill","descendants":16,"id":20187762,"kids":[20188052,20204936,20205196,20202395],"score":97,"time":1560558811,"title":"Amiga BBS Online in 2019","type":"story","url":"https://blog.nootch.net/post/amiga-bbs-online-2019/"},{"by":"whack","descendants":125,"id":20187572,"kids":[20188675,20189925,20188345,20188927,20188979,20189693,20190101,20188299,20189008,20189325,20187959,20189761,20190095,20197426,20190624,20189819,20193651,20189288,20192354,20188001,20190767,20191325,20189185,20189459,20189992,20189759,20190833,20189501,20189594],"score":203,"time":1560555984,"title":"Chromium and the Browser Monoculture Problem","type":"story","url":"https://dev.to/kenbellows/chromium-and-the-browser-monoculture-problem-420n"},{"by":"pseudolus","descendants":25,"id":20187417,"kids":[20189559,20189801,20189790,20189302,20190907,20189531,20191639,20189403,20189629,20197494,20190430,20191718,20189612,20189383],"score":89,"time":1560553960,"title":"Bald Eagle Filmed Swimming","type":"story","url":"https://www.npr.org/2019/06/14/732843218/bald-eagle-caught-elegantly-swimming"},{"by":"gamechangr","descendants":23,"id":20187295,"kids":[20187972,20194546,20187896],"score":21,"time":1560552434,"title":"Joe Rogan Experience #1245 – Andrew Yang","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTsEzmFamZ8"},{"by":"amaccuish","descendants":4,"id":20187258,"kids":[20187729,20188145,20187826,20187320],"score":9,"time":1560552027,"title":"Hundreds of active and former US police officers are part of extremist FB groups","type":"story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/14/18679598/facebook-hate-groups-law-enforcement-police-officers-racism-islamaphobia"},{"by":"pseudolus","descendants":12,"id":20187381,"kids":[20188113,20187960],"score":34,"time":1560553539,"title":"The Safest Place in a Car Crash Isn’t the Back Seat Anymore","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/business/seatbelts-back-seat-safety.html"},{"by":"onuralp","descendants":6,"id":20187129,"kids":[20197455,20198980,20201498,20199231],"score":64,"time":1560550907,"title":"Truth: A Love Story","type":"story","url":"https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2019/07/dna-testing-schreiber"},{"by":"parris","descendants":7,"id":20187450,"kids":[20189114,20188375,20188445],"score":11,"time":1560554369,"title":"10 Books that Changed my Career as a Software Engineer","type":"story","url":"https://storyforj.com/s/dk79PY"},{"by":"feross","descendants":124,"id":20187035,"kids":[20188255,20188791,20188825,20189482,20189908,20188036,20188516,20189135,20188956,20188787,20187905,20188485,20188692,20189158,20188042,20189406,20188446],"score":105,"time":1560549850,"title":"JavaScript Is the CO2 of the Web [audio]","type":"story","url":"https://changelog.com/jsparty/80"},{"by":"gregsadetsky","descendants":15,"id":20186915,"kids":[20188748,20187208,20187846],"score":30,"text":"A Google Chrome extension I created 3 years ago has 50k users.

I had two-factor auth enabled on my account which was linked to my mobile. I retain sole access to all of my devices and that e-mail address.

I submitted a bug bounty report on Twitter’s HackerOne page [1] but it was promptly closed citing no access to individual accounts.<p>I reached out to some current and former employees on via Twitter and only had one response from a former employee.

But I am also under no impression that I am an artist. Architecture fascinated me. I was opting for it at college but family didn&#x27;t let me. Peers and seniors all advised against it. At leat in my country (India) only those opted for the field who couldn&#x27;t get into mainstream engineering streams.<p>I was listening to a podcast episode once; in that a British woman was the guest and she used to make old stuff for films. Old newspapers, postcards, stained old crumpled pieces of paper. I found that really exciting.<p>I am a hobbyist beginner level carpenter. I like the idea of making&#x2F;designing&#x2F;conceptualising&#x2F;imagining things that one can touch, look at, admire. I have always been writing in my own capacity. I write in my diary regularly (not just the daily entries but a lot more than that) and sometimes publish among literarily inclined friends and acquaintances in my native language Hindi.<p>I am trying to find cross disciplinary masters and PhDs and whether I can shift to something else at Masters level than CS that allows me to move into another field. But so far I have really not found anything. Or maybe I am not finding the right way.<p>I just thought I will post it here hoping someone might have gone down this road.

Here be dragons, traveler, be ye warned.<p>* This is definitely a WIP, and has its share of problems.<p>* It uses pretty eager searching against what&#x27;s essentially text-based querying, so there&#x27;s a lot of problems on filter &#x2F; query, such as word boundary searching, etc. So, for example, if you&#x27;re a Go programmer, trying to query against that term with this setup, good luck. Likewise, “Java” will return all “JavaScript” entries, so that&#x27;s also really helpful. Sorry for that. I plan on improving it, however, for this to really be useful...<p>* For this to really be a robust query engine, the HN API job listings would actually need some improvements. It&#x27;d be nice to have actual tagged return posts, for example. I think this would require some sort of form submission instead of just plain text submission on the jobs feed, but that would be an undertaking from HN&#x27;s part.","time":1560277593,"title":"Show HN: Dashboard for HN Who Is Hiring","type":"story"},{"by":"kkp","descendants":4,"id":20157684,"kids":[20162945,20164124,20163913],"score":7,"time":1560275058,"title":"Heart Attacks are Common Amongst Silicon Valley Workers","type":"story","url":"https://terminalhorror.blogspot.com/2019/06/heart-attack-common-disease-among.html"},{"by":"smacktoward","descendants":12,"id":20157661,"kids":[20160059,20158541,20159713,20161205,20159232],"score":41,"time":1560274966,"title":"Microsoft’s Game Pass Is a Kafkaesque Nightmare on PC","type":"story","url":"https://www.escapistmagazine.com/v2/2019/06/11/microsofts-game-pass-is-a-kafkaesque-nightmare-on-pc/"},{"by":"Reedx","descendants":2,"id":20157622,"kids":[20158801,20158441],"score":17,"time":1560274720,"title":"A new book says married women are miserable.

I have got a baccalaureaute in these and am pursing a master&#x27;s degree, having once wanted to become a diplomat or a curator.<p>While initially single-minded in my passion, in recent years I have become more invested in a variety of social issues: social inequalities (regional, racial, religious), helping domestic violence victims, improving education and securing humanitarian aid. Among those, climate change and combating it have become my primary field of interest.<p>I might not make a good biologist or an engineer, but I have shown promise in activism. I have co-founded and run a local youth organization. I have participated in a UN HRC session (3 weeks), as well as in last year&#x27;s UN Climate Change Conference in Poland, thanks to an NGO with which I collaborated: thus I know of that work environment. I also have partial command of law. In light of these, I would not mind becoming an ecological activist, or for my career to have elements of that.<p>Problem is, I am lost. I feel that I don&#x27;t know what is out there, nor do I have anyone to ask for directions.<p>In particular, I am at a loss in these areas:<p>1. What are the ways in which one can make a meaningful impact (realistically, not idealistically)?<p>2. What background is needed to get involved in that? I am ready to return to university. Which schools or majors are the most suitable?<p>3. What people do you know who are involved whom I can ask or whose impressive example I could follow?<p>4. Which people or institutions can I ask for further guidance?<p>All input and opinion appreciated.

Obviously this is still tiny but does the growth point to better things to come?<p>One thing about the inbound traffic I am getting is that it&#x27;s all for direct restaurant searches (e.g. &quot;Johnny&#x27;s Diner&quot;) rather than area searches (e.g. &quot;Newtown restaurants&quot;); the latter is where you see the site&#x27;s true value, so everyone just bounces from the restaurant page.<p>I was beginning to get disheartened until this new upswing, so wondering if I should be hopeful? Also, surely a domain of that age must be worth something? Thanks<p>P.S.

a hobbyist developer who made three very small, ad-free apps. Apple charges $99 per year for anyone to make apps (in stark contrast to the $25 one-off fee that Google charges). Since I&#x27;m not actively working on my apps right now, I don&#x27;t want to pay Apple another $99 this year. But my existing free apps will stay in the store for those who want to download them, right?<p>No. Apple&#x27;s Developer Support claimed on the phone that keeping an existing app in the store if the developer isn&#x27;t paying the annual $99 tribute would be a safety concern, &quot;like an airport letting an unscanned bag through security&quot;. This really, really doesn&#x27;t make sense: aside from the other disanalogies, if anything it&#x27;s more like an airline kicking out a bag that they&#x27;ve already scanned and deemed safe because the owner refuses to pay them again in perpetuity.<p>The other justification Apple gave for the $99 per year fee was the storage and delivery costs of delivering my apps. For the record, my largest app is 40mb.<p>I have two suggestions for Apple. The first is a no-brainer: any authorised app should be allowed to stay in the store for as long as the platforms it works on are still supported, without the developer having to pay an annual tribute.<p>The second is a bigger step, but I think a reasonable one: Apple should have a free tier for small app developers. For example, it should not require an annual paid subscription to create and maintain free, ad-free apps.<p>Big tech companies are under a lot more scrutiny these days for abuse of market power, and this strikes me as the kind of reason why: I just don&#x27;t believe that in a competitive market the equilibrium cost for a basic developer account would be anything close to $99 per year, or that Apple would kick existing apps out of its store unless the developer keeps paying every year.","time":1560060767,"title":"Apple Charging to Keep Apps in

Termius is an SSH client that works on desktop and mobile. The big difference with other SSH clients that Termius syncs data across devices using end-to-end encryption.<p>DevOps, sysadmins, and network engineers benefit from using Termius because they can keep all the information for managing their servers in one secure place, e.g., snippets, connection strings, history, etc. Our product vision is to rebuild the command line experience around an engineer, not around the mainframe where it all started. For example, Termius will help engineers to safely keep information about their servers, shell commands, and terminal logs. This information will be accessible from any device and used to improve productivity, e.g., autocomplete commands in the terminal.<p>Dmitry and I met when we both got our first job in a small game development studio in Omsk, Siberia. Actually, at that time, it was an advertising agency with an ambition to become a game development studio. We were students, and it was a perfect place to learn on our own a ton about software development in C++. After four years of hard work, we managed to release a 3D game for PC with real-time physics. We involved kids in testing the gameplay, which allowed us to watch other people using our software. It was a life-changing experience when we saw how software could drive emotion, especially with kids and games. After that, we got hooked on building products that people love.<p>After the commercial failure of the game studio, we went to work for an outsourcing company. We were working on some enterprise software, which was not a lot of fun.  Therefore we were working after-hours and weekends on many ideas. After two years, we decided to start our own outsourcing company. We planned to use outsourcing company resources to develop our first product.<p>Roman started Termius as his pet project at our outsourcing company about seven years ago. Roman needed a way to start a C++ project compilation from my iPhone. The project used a lot of Boost::Spirit and a complete rebuild could take around 15 mins. This time was ideal for a cup of coffee with colleagues or a short bout of office-chair fencing. However, some compilation or linking errors could come up, so he needed to keep an eye on it. It was hard to justify paying $10 for iSSH for such a minor use case. Free SSH clients in the App Store were ugly or had ads in the terminal window. Roman thought that a basic SSH client with the terminal must be available on all platforms for free and ad-free. SSH is as universal as email, and most operating systems have at least one basic and free email client. That is how it is all started.<p>First, we needed to solve a couple of UX challenges. SSH client requires terminal emulator support to render the output. Also, the mobile keyboard doesn’t have some necessary keys like Fn, Ctrl, Alt, and Tab. Besides, these keys must support sequences(Ctrl-Alt-x or Ctrl-x Ctrl-f) to support Emacs. That was our first UX challenge. Initially, we developed Ctrl and Alt in the shape of a lollipop\npinned to the sides of the terminal window. Those were special buttons with two states: tap for single usage(for Ctrl-C) and drag to the center(locked state) for combinations like Ctrl-Alt-x. We have changed the design of the terminal window three times to make it easier to grasp. We ended up emulating a lot of what native OS does because users are familiar with those patterns already. In the recent versions, all the additional keys are grouped and sit on top of the system keyboard. Ctrl and Alt work a lot like Shift(double tap to lock) which was introduced later by Apple.<p>Once we released Termius (at that time was called Server Auditor) for iOS and Android, we started to get quite a lot of feedback on the missing features and bugs. Frequently this feedback was in the form of one-star review with a typical comment like “Will switch to 5 stars if you add blah”. In some cases, we had no idea why users needed those features and had no way to ask about it. App Store did not provide the response feature at that time. Therefore we integrated the feedback channel and the feature voting straight into the app(UserVoice). After that, we were able to communicate with our users a lot easier. This tight feedback loop kept us engaged and motivated to keep working on the product. We also got to hear stories from users who used Termius in different life situations. Some users fixed a server being on holiday or saved their bacon because they could continue working from their iPhone. One of the fascinating cases was a story from one visually impaired user who was managing a server on his iPad using Termius and VoiceOver.<p>Initially, we released Termius as a free app for iOS and Android. After a year of continuous work, the apps got to the first places in both app stores when you search for SSH. Organic search traffic combined with good ratings drove pretty good daily downloads numbers. We realized that we are building something that people want.<p>When we were researching user churn, we realized that we could solve even a bigger problem. Some users stopped using the mobile app because it was daunting to keep the information up to date on the mobile device. They downloaded Termius to use when they are away from their desk. However, when an emergency happened, they didn’t have all the things to deal with it, e.g., connection strings, keys, commands to restart a service, you name it. As a result, a standalone mobile SSH client was useless for them, and they had to run to their desk. We realized that if we add a desktop app and secure sync with end-to-end encryption, then all the data would stay fresh on all devices and users would be able to rely on the mobile apps.<p>Moreover, having sync enabled us to rethink the whole command line user experience. For example, Termius could accumulate all the commands when you work in a shell and use them for auto-complete an all devices. Another example, that engineers encouraged to invest a bit of their time to keep the information in order because it stays with them all the time. Termius supports groups and tags to maintain a list of hundreds of hosts.<p>What is next? Tens of millions of engineers use the command line to interact with remote computer systems. Many of them maintain infrastructure together. Our next step is to bring more collaboration to sysadmin and DevOps teams based on their interaction with the command line. Things like terminal logs, recently executed commands and lists of currently runnings systems could be shared among all team members with Termius. That would make the whole process more transparent and new member on-boarding a lot easier. The similar transition that Google Docs brought to collective document creation.<p>HackerNews community probably has the highest concentration of engineers who might use Termius daily. Therefore we would love to hear your feedback!","time":1559852615,"title":"Launch HN: Termius (YC W19) – SSH client that works on desktop and mobile","type":"story"},{"by":"QueensGambit","descendants":3,"id":20118584,"kids":[20119099,20119339,20119778],"score":4,"text":"I found my 5 1&#x2F;2 year old son sobbing on the bed.

solutions for client-side caching in GraphQL are slow, heavy, and often come with a lot of functionality that may be undesirable if you are looking for a caching-only package that aims to decrease loading time. We are excited to release FlacheQL 2.0, a ‘smart’ client-side caching solution.<p>FlacheQL 2.0 returns subsets from cached data based on the query’s parameters. For example, if you send a query to the Yelp GraphQL endpoint for 20 businesses, and then you send one for 15 businesses, as long as the parameters match, FlacheQL 2.0 will return that subset directly from the cache. Additionally, if you were to query for 20 businesses and then subsequently 25 businesses, FlacheQL 2.0 will retrieve the set of 20 from the cache, restructure the query so that it only pings the server for the remaining 5, and stitch the two responses back together to send the response to the client. This reduces the load on your server from GraphQL resolvers, and speeds up loading time in your application. This new release also includes cache persistence via IndexedDB and TTL cache expiration.<p>We have seen a substantial decrease in page load times relative to other caching libraries. Check out the demo app if you’re curious to see how we stack up against Apollo—we have query timers on there for comparison purposes. Check it out here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flacheql.io.<p>We’d love to hear your feedback about our library, available on npm. This is a work in progress so please feel free to contribute or raise issues as you see fit.

My current Macs are a 2013 MacBook Air and a 2013 Mac Pro, both running macOS Mojave.  I prefer macOS to Windows and desktop Linux environments due to macOS&#x27;s Unix environment, support for commercial software such as Microsoft Office and iTunes, small but essential programs such as Dictionary.app, and the overall fit-and-finish of macOS compared to other desktops.  However, from a hardware standpoint, I feel abandoned by Apple.  I value user-serviceability and upgradability in my hardware (the only reason I ended up buying a MacBook Air in 2013 was because I still wanted to stay on macOS in the days of Windows 8 and GNOME 3), and I was waiting for two years for yesterday&#x27;s Mac Pro announcement, only to be disappointed by the pricing of the Mac Pro, which is twice as expensive as the previous model.<p>Since the demise of BeOS in the early 2000s, there hasn&#x27;t been any commercial competitors to Windows and macOS in the desktop computing realm other than perhaps ChromeOS.  However, unlike the early 2000s when Windows&#x27; marketshare was in the 90+ percent range, today there is more diversity of personal computing platforms thanks to the popularity of smartphones, tablets, and Chromebooks.

Most of the “development” I do now days is filling up C++ structures and sending them off as messages to other components via an antiquated communication layer developed in-house 15 years ago.  The primary reason the company needs experienced developers is to keep at bay the multi-headed spaghetti monster which is their code-base.<p>The common perception among my colleagues is that this is a good as it can get at our age: yes it’s a life-sucking, mind-numbing job but it pays the bills and leaves you some time to watch television at the evenings.

Hope it&#x27;s not too long.<p>I&#x27;ve been coding on and off since I was a kid. I&#x27;m twenty-nine now. To be frank, I&#x27;m not that good at it. I&#x27;m not bad at it, but I&#x27;ve never invested the effort to get really good, because I never cared to be. I like making things and solving problems, but I don&#x27;t get exactly get a thrill out of learning a new framework or spending hours debugging a single function.<p>Writing code, as you all know, is incredibly frustrating and often stultifying work. For me, it&#x27;s rewarding to make something, and I&#x27;ve enjoyed building many small projects in the past. That said, the process sometimes seems like more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;d be doing if market forces hadn&#x27;t steered me to deploying my (limited) tech abilities, but as it stands, I&#x27;ve been working as a data scientist for a little while. I&#x27;m not that great at that either. I&#x27;ve invested some time and money in skill-building—I just graduated with an MA in a quantitative subject from an Ivy League university—but I&#x27;m nowhere near the level of competence of many of the data scientists on the job market now.<p>And I don&#x27;t think I want to be. I don&#x27;t want to spend my whole day writing ETL pipelines or optimizing ad prices. Ideally, I don&#x27;t want to spend my whole day in front of a computer. But I do want to make enough money to go on vacation occasionally, and I want the flexibility and mobility that it seems like only the tech industry is offering these days. Millennials, right?<p>So I feel sort of trapped. I&#x27;m not sure what I want to be doing, but when I scan job listings, I find nothing interesting to me. I feel like I have lots to offer, like I&#x27;m a real generalist with a lot of interests and a lot of aptitude, but the only thing a hiring manager will see is that I can code--and that I&#x27;m not very good at it. I can&#x27;t be the only person who has had this experience.","time":1559329770,"title":"I like coding but I hate coding","type":"story"},{"by":"tango12","descendants":80,"id":20063979,"kids":[20065253,20064222,20065133,20066750,20064281,20064183,20067113,20067737,20064598,20065882,20065771,20064307,20065093,20065818,20068056,20170806,20086308],"score":353,"time":1559329442,"title":"Scaling to 1M active GraphQL subscriptions on Postgres","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/blob/master/architecture/live-queries.md"},{"by":"step93","descendants":6,"id":20063945,"kids":[20068864,20066113],"score":24,"time":1559329162,"title":"The Unbearable Lightness of Java","type":"story","url":"https://jodd.org/"},{"by":"MilnerRoute","descendants":2,"id":20063891,"kids":[20063899,20064094],"score":3,"text":"Children are lured to a web site to tell a third party what library books they&#x27;re reading.

Amazon gets involved -- dispensing notifications from Echo devices to children about when it&#x27;s time to resume reading a specific book.<p>Beanstack&#x27;s privacy policy reveals they &quot;use IP addresses and session identifiers to analyze trends,&quot; as well as &quot;to track user activities, to infer user interests, and to otherwise induce, deduce, and gather information.&quot;  It also specifically states that they ignore &quot;Do not track&quot; signals.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.beanstack.com&#x2F;privacy<p>That&#x27;s what my local public library is touting now.

They &quot;just work&quot;  so you can focus on development instead of system config, yet still give you a Unix-like environment with first-class Bash support.

They have a strong software ecosystem.<p>But given the recent strides in Windows laptops (and Windows itself), some of which even have official Ubuntu support now, combined with the problems the current line of MBP&#x27;s has experienced (and continues to experience), is it time to re-evaluate? Many of us (including myself) are still holding on to our 2015 MBP&#x27;s, but what comes after that? Have people had good experiences switching to something else (the XPS 13 comes to mind)? Any recommendations or anecdotes? Are some just holding out for the next major MacBook Pro revamp (likely in 2020)? Or are the current Pros not as bad as the press makes them seem?

Further, China may need designs that more efficiently use domestic chips and do not require as advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes. One way to achieve these goals may be to &quot;refactor&quot; Western IT.<p>The design of current Western IT is governed by a plethora of standards, both official standards from IETF, IEEE, ITU, ISO..., as well as unofficial standards set by dominant manufacturers and associations.<p>The complexity of standards grew over 4 decades because researchers want their contributions included, manufacturers want their patent positions protected, incumbents want their investments protected, and new entrants want extensions for differentiation. The complexity of unofficial standards grows because of multiple competitors in the same market, avoidance of patents, and backward compatibility to protect market positions. Besides the variety of standard venues, there  is the inevitable commercial, political and interpersonal relationship issues that are settled by adopting compromises.<p>China, with less IT history and a large market, may be in a good position to analyse and extract a small subset of Western IT standards for internal adoption.<p>The West has coped with complexity by making very fast processors using advanced processes and implementing the complexity in software. With less complexity it may be possible to move more functionality into ASICs made by less advanced processes and achieve the same end user services results using less infrastructure and energy.<p>China may have an opportuntity to remove the cruft of compromise and the baggage of backward compatibility, and to refactor Western IT into a better system.","time":1559231866,"title":"Can China Refactor Western IT?","type":"story"},{"by":"adventured","descendants":11,"id":20052286,"kids":[20058309,20057936,20056872,20059421,20079123,20057682,20057523,20056732],"score":47,"time":1559230625,"title":"Bing’s Not the Laughingstock of Technology Anymore","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-05-30/microsoft-s-bing-is-not-the-laughingstock-of-technology-anymore"},{"by":"_bxg1","descendants":12,"id":20052605,"kids":[20053410,20054181,20052717,20052638],"score":12,"time":1559232473,"title":"Microsoft’s Universal Windows Platform app dream is dead and buried","type":"story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/30/18645609/microsofts-universal-windows-app-dead-microsoft-store-windows-store"},{"by":"feld","descendants":15,"id":20052076,"kids":[20052221,20052888,20053042,20052475,20052554,20052161,20052707,20052131,20052752,20054250],"score":29,"text":"There is no way to delete your account and your comments on HN.

Strolling accross the village the engineer stumbles on a local library and regularly starts visting there.\n\n  One day a man in his early 60s visits the library&#x27;s computer section and sits at a computer next to the software professional. The man, through corner of his eyes, starts observing what the software professional is doing. The man has been made redundant few years ago. He visits the library to clear his head of his everyday life struggles.\n\n  On observing the software professional for few days, the man out of curiosity starts reading about computers and programming. Within a few months he becomes confident and starts his early attempts at programming. Step by step using online videos and some help from the software professional he learns how to develop simple web apps. Life starts becoming exciting for him once again. After a year or so he publishes his web app just as an exercise and for fun. But the web app starts getting traction (with all the excitement and panic that comes with unexpected success!) and he goes on to become a successful tech entrepreneur.\n\n\n</code></pre>\nThe movie shall have startup lessons sprinkled all over the story.<p>It is a simple story and can be fleshed out with lots of social messages about effects of redundancies on communities, struggles, resilience, aspirations, ageism, sexism, racism, discrimination, immigration, reverse-discrimination and also other social issues of people living far away from the centers of power and mega cities.<p>Let me know what you think, and very much looking for your participation.","time":1559132747,"title":"How about we make an online movie or web-series?","type":"story"},{"by":"_tmel","descendants":43,"id":20039248,"kids":[20039718,20040916,20042929,20040288,20042881,20042620,20042111,20041516,20046089,20043955,20041280,20039626],"score":39,"text":"Let my experience serve as a valuable lesson to entrepreneurs - do your due diligence on investors.<p>I spent a little over a year and $20,000 of my own capital building a FinTech software. It demonstrated a lot of interest and potential (E.g. a $5 B company was reviewing our product prior to launch to be a client) , but rather wrapping it up and getting revenue to raise money from Tier 1&#x2F;2 VCs, I had an offer from an investor to put in $1 M at an unattractive valuation.<p>Myself thinking, &#x27;I don&#x27;t care about the valuation, I just want to get the money in to accelerate&#x27;, I accepted - despite being in various stages of due diligence with three investors. After several months of negotiations and many calls a legal agreement was formed... The important lesson here is the &#x27;hidden valuation&#x27;, that is, in the value of the quality of your investor.<p>Usually when an investor signs a term sheet, the money comes through relatively quickly and things accelerate, but week after week, and excuse after excuse the money never came in. During this period, having expected the money to come in, I hired my top developers full-time and am now stuck with those expenses - unable to comfortably afford it.<p>Now, I&#x27;m stuck with a rouge &#x27;investor&#x27; owning 50% of my company without putting in any a dime, close to $10,000 in bills, and a software I poured a year of my life into and made many sacrifices for. At this point, if I were to raise more money, I would have less than 20% of my company on the first fundraising round (assuming giving a real investor 20 - 25%).<p>Despite this, the people you have on your cap table and relationships between them can send most top investors &#x27;running for the hills&#x27;, they don&#x27;t like drama and founders with little equity - as it decreases motivation and means they can&#x27;t negotiate attractive valuations for themselves. As much as I would like to admit - this is almost certainly game over.<p>Had I conducted even slight due diligence, this could have been solved. If I had held out longer and got a little traction, I could have appealed to Tier 1&#x2F;2 VCs, rather than risk doing business with an unknown entity.<p>I should also note, I have a background in PE&#x2F;VC myself, I&#x27;m not a fresh entrepreneur either.

To be clear I am not talking about someone never having responded ever, I&#x27;m talking about a situation where the conversation has begun, you may have exchanged potentially dozens of emails, perhaps even spoken on the phone, perhaps even written custom code or helped with integration. It looks like the term originally comes from online dating but I am talking about the business variety.<p>The specific question I have is, assuming this is going to happen and accepting that there will be a subset of potential prospects that do this, has anyone found any ways to avoid this from happening, seeing warning signs, or reducing the rate this happens? In particular interest, it seems clear they are no longer interested in the product or service, but were they <i>ever</i> interested? I&#x27;m reading about the psychology around why this happens too and from what I understand they were interested at some point, but then changed their mind, perhaps the product wasn&#x27;t good enough, or didn&#x27;t quite meet their needs, whatever the reason, you won&#x27;t find out, but I am assuming they were interested at some point. Of course, the important thing is to quickly move on when you have realized this has happened but I think the rate of ghosting has crept up and hearing about other people&#x27;s experience and

A single personal computer started to expand to tablets, phones and laptops. We like to see the same photo or document from phone to tablet to laptop. Dropbox solved this problem with a centralized storage where we can dump all our files and access them from wherever we want. To make it a viable business model, a subscription service got attached to storage size. We started dumping all our photos, documents, scanned receipts, photocopies into different folders.<p>The problem we face today is very different. Some of the important documents such as scanned receipts, tax returns documents are also dumped into the same folders. It is difficult to search and find them. Literally it is like searching a needle in haystack. Sharing the document with the right person is also difficult. We make yet another copy of downloading the document and emailing to share it. Once emailed, the document gets shared for ever without owners&#x27; control. Researchers found many corporate sensitive data was shared without knowledge. Check this article published by Adversis.

The format has proven to work well, so we&#x27;re doing it again. The 2019 event will be on Saturday, June 29 at YC in Mountain View: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;workatastartup.com&#x2F;expo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;workatastartup.com&#x2F;expo</a><p>Many engineers are interested in working at smaller companies. But there aren&#x27;t many efficient ways to meet a bunch of them at once, and it&#x27;s a ton of repetitive work to seek them out one by one. Meanwhile, hiring is the biggest challenge most YC startups are facing. That&#x27;s an obvious matchmaking problem, and bringing everyone together in one big event is one thing YC can do to help address it. It&#x27;s a fun and interesting day, too!<p>This year, we&#x27;re bringing together 40 YC companies in one place. Rapid-fire company presentations—like Demo Day, but for engineers instead of investors—will give you a way to quickly survey the companies. Following this, we&#x27;ll have a casual open house for you to engage one-on-one with any founders and early engineers who you thought were interesting.<p>New this time: We&#x27;ve heard from people who are interested in joining somewhat later-stage startups, because they think their skills may translate better to roles there than at the classic 2-to-10 person early stage. So this year we&#x27;ve included a number of larger startups, like Gusto and Sift Science. These companies have specialized needs across data, infrastructure, security and more. We hope this gives you more options to match your skill set, interests and risk appetite.<p>Working at a startup is for sure not for everybody! Justin Kan covered this in his post here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.atrium.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;work-at-a-startup&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.atrium.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;work-at-a-startup&#x2F;</a>, and HN users are never shy about pointing out the downsides. But I can tell you from personal experience that the upsides are powerful if you&#x27;re in a position to go for it. For me, working at startups has been a unique opportunity to work closely with talented and experienced founders. (Many founders at this year&#x27;s event learned to ship products at places like Square, Google, Linkedin and even Gusto.) The magic of working with a small, closely aligned team and the feeling of true ownership and impact is something many of us long for in our careers. The intense learning curves, the chance to personally grow rapidly along with a company—these are experiences which those of us lucky enough to have would never trade away.<p>Of course, there are no guarantees: it&#x27;s a classic risk&#x2F;reward tradeoff.

What is the correct way to handle this?<p>One option I considered was starting an LLC&#x2F;Bank for &#x27;all side-projects&#x27;, and then if&#x2F;when a particular one started producing revenue I split it off into a separate business&#x2F;bank.

Worst of both worlds.<p>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m asking for the impossible but I want to get at least a grip of where I should even begin looking for a trial of low-level programming work. Any ideas of where to start?<p>I want to make it clear I am not looking for work at Google or Facebook. AMD, ARM and NVIDIA are more my speed. Since I can&#x27;t get an internship at a place like this then something as &quot;internship-like&quot; as possible. Something that gives you a chance to try something you haven&#x27;t done before committing to a full time job.","time":1558824571,"title":"Ask HN: Breaking into low-level programming work with o a CS
