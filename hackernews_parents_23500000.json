I&#x27;m Max from BaseDash (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.basedash.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.basedash.io</a>). BaseDash is an internal tool that lets you edit your production database with the ease of a spreadsheet. It&#x27;s like being able to use Airtable to manage your company&#x27;s internal operations.<p>I was working on a side project a few years ago that required a lot of manual data management. I was using Django Admin which was fine, but wished I could just set up a two-way sync between my SQL database and Airtable (without any crazy Zapier workflows).<p>After building a quick prototype as an internal tool, I realized that there was a space missing for a product somewhere between an admin panel and a database client. Something with an amazing interface that&#x27;s usable by both engineers and non-technical users who need to access data within their company (e.g. customer support, operations).<p>From there, I built BaseDash with a strong focus on expanding upon existing tools I love, with extra care and polish. The resulting product is a polished, opinionated internal tool, with all the functionality most companies need out-of-the-box.<p>Being a web app, there are some great features that BaseDash enables for cross-functional teams. BaseDash keeps a full edit history of all changes made, makes it super easy to share access to teammates, and enables Google Sheets-like real-time collaboration for editing data.<p>We currently support most SQL databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redshift, SQL Server, MariaDB), with support for MongoDB and Firestore on the roadmap. We offer a hosted version, or you can host it yourself on-prem.<p>We&#x27;re still in early access but happy to invite the Hacker News community to try the product out. We&#x27;re currently focused on small-to-medium sized software companies, with a combination of engineers and non-technical users.

It reduces energy consumption from the battery and extends the range of an electric car to more than 700 miles on a single charge.<p>Our product for EVs is a magneto-mechanical battery. It provides the electric vehicle with 70% additional mechanical energy. As a result, the consumption of electrical energy from the car battery is reduced by 70%. On average, an EV consumes about 16 kWh of energy per 60 miles. Thanks to the additional mechanical energy from our magnetic battery, the electric vehicle will consume only 4.8 kWh per 60 miles, thus increasing the range to more than 700 miles on a single charge.<p>All VCs we met decided not to invest in our startup (after talking to physicists).<p>How progress is supposed to go ahead if physicists are afraid of extending their knowledge about the universe?

HN.<p>We’re Peter, Raza and Jordan of Humanloop (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;humanloop.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;humanloop.com</a>) and we’re building a low code platform to annotate data, rapidly train and then deploy Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. We use active learning research to make this possible with 5-10x less labelled data.<p>We’ve worked on large machine learning products in industry (Alexa, text-to-speech systems at Google and in insurance modelling) and seen first-hand the huge efforts required to get these systems trained, deployed and working well in production. Despite huge progress in pretrained models (BERT, GPT-3), one of the biggest bottlenecks remains getting enough _good quality_ labelled data.<p>Unlike annotations for driverless cars, the data that’s being annotated for NLP often requires domain expertise that’s hard to outsource. We’ve spoken to teams using NLP for medical chat bots, legal contract analysis, cyber security monitoring and customer service, and it’s not uncommon to find teams of lawyers or doctors doing text labelling tasks. This is an expensive barrier to building and deploying NLP.<p>We aim to solve this problem by providing a text annotation platform that trains a model as your team annotates. Coupling data annotation and model training has a number of benefits:<p>1) we can use the model to select the most valuable data to annotate next – this “active learning” loop can often reduce data requirements by 10x<p>2) a tight iteration cycle between annotation and training lets you pick up on errors much sooner and correct annotation guidelines<p>3) as soon as you’ve finished the annotation cycle you have a trained model ready to be deployed.<p>Active learning is far from a new idea, but getting it to work well in practice is surprisingly challenging, especially for deep learning. Simple approaches use the ML models’ predictive uncertainty (the entropy of the softmax) to select what data to label... but in practice this often selects genuinely ambiguous or “noisy” data that both annotators and models have a hard time handling. From a usability perspective, the process needs to be cognizant of the annotation effort, and the models need to quickly update with new labelled data, otherwise it’s too frustrating to have a human-in-the-loop training session.<p>Our approach uses Bayesian deep learning to tackle these issues. Raza and Peter have worked on this in their PhDs at University College London alongside fellow cofounders David and Emine [1, 2]. With Bayesian deep learning, we’re incorporating uncertainty in the parameters of the models themselves, rather than just finding the best model. This can be used to find the data where the model is uncertain, not just where the data is noisy. And we use a rapid approximate Bayesian update to give quick feedback from small amounts of data [3]. An upside of this is that the models have well-calibrated uncertainty estimates -- to know when they don’t know -- and we’re exploring how this could be used in production settings for a human-in-the-loop fallback.<p>Since starting we’ve been working with data science teams at two large law firms to help build out an internal platform for cyber threat monitoring and data extraction. We’re now opening up the platform to train text classifiers and span-tagging models quickly and deploy them to the cloud. A common use case is for classifying support tickets or chatbot intents.<p>We came together to work on this because we kept seeing data as the bottleneck for the deployment of ML and were inspired by ideas like Andrej Karpathy’s software 2.0 [4]. We anticipate a future in which the barriers to ML deployment become sufficiently lowered that domain experts are able to automate tasks for themselves through machine teaching and we view data annotation tools as a first step along this path.<p>Thanks for reading.

Management wanted me to use a well-known XML database that they had just bought a license for. This option would have required to take down production for about a week just to ingest the data. And a week downtime was not an option. With no more money to spend on software, I turned to alternatives such as OpenTSDB but they were not a fit for our data model. There was no solution in sight to deliver the project.<p>Then, I stumbled upon Peter Lawrey’s Java Chronicle library [1]. It loaded the same data in 2 minutes instead of a week using memory-mapped files. Besides the performance aspect, I found it fascinating that such a simple method was solving multiple issues simultaneously: fast write, read can happen even before data is committed to disk, code interacts with memory rather than IO functions, no buffers to copy. Incidentally, this was my first exposure to zero-GC Java.<p>But there were several issues. First, at the time It didn’t look like the library was going to be maintained. Second, it used Java NIO instead of using the OS API directly. This adds overhead since it creates individual objects with sole purpose to hold a memory address for each memory page. Third, although the NIO allocation API was well documented, the release API was not. It was really easy to run out of memory and hard to manage memory page release. I decided to ditch the XML DB and then started to write a custom storage engine in Java, similar to what Java Chronicle did. This engine used memory mapped files, off-heap memory and a custom query system for geospatial time series. Implementing this was a refreshing experience. I learned more in a few weeks than in years on the job.<p>Throughout my career, I mostly worked at large companies where developers are “managed” via itemized tasks sent as tickets. There was no room for creativity or initiative. In fact, it was in one’s best interest to follow the ticket&#x27;s exact instructions, even if it was complete nonsense. I had just been promoted to a managerial role and regretted it after a week. After so much time hoping for a promotion, I immediately wanted to go back to the technical side. I became obsessed with learning new stuff again, particularly in the high performance space.<p>With some money aside, I left my job and started to work on QuestDB solo. I used Java and a small C layer to interact directly with the OS API without passing through a selector API. Although existing OS API wrappers would have been easier to get started with, the overhead increases complexity and hurts performance. I also wanted the system to be completely GC-free. To do this, I had to build off-heap memory management myself and I could not use off-the-shelf libraries. I had to rewrite many of the standard ones over the years to avoid producing any garbage.<p>As I had my first kid, I had to take contracting gigs to make ends meet over the following 6 years. All the stuff I had been learning boosted my confidence and I started performing well at interviews. This allowed me to get better paying contracts, I could take fewer jobs and free up more time to work on QuestDB while looking after my family. I would do research during the day and implement this into QuestDB at night. I was constantly looking for the next thing, which would take performance closer to the limits of the hardware.<p>A year in, I realised that my initial design was actually flawed and that it had to be thrown away. It had no concept of separation between readers and writers and would thus allow dirty reads. Storage was not guaranteed to be contiguous, and pages could be of various non-64-bit-divisible sizes. It was also very much cache-unfriendly, forcing the use of slow row-based reads instead of fast columnar and vectorized ones.Commits were slow, and as individual column files could be committed independently, they left the data open to corruption.<p>Although this was a setback, I got back to work. I wrote the new engine to allow atomic and durable multi-column commits, provide repeatable read isolation, and for commits to be instantaneous. To do this, I separated transaction files from the data files. This made it possible to commit multiple columns simultaneously as a simple update of the last committed row id. I also made storage dense by removing overlapping memory pages and writing data byte by byte over page edges.<p>This new approach improved query performance. It made it easy to split data across worker threads and to optimise the CPU pipeline with prefetch. It unlocked column-based execution and additional virtual parallelism with SIMD instruction sets [2] thanks to Agner Fog’s Vector Class Library [3]. It made it possible to implement more recent innovations like our own version of Google SwissTable [4]. I published more details when we released a demo server a few weeks ago on ShowHN [5]. This demo is still available to try online with a pre-loaded dataset of 1.6 billion rows [6]. Although it was hard and discouraging at first, this rewrite turned out to be the second best thing that happened to QuestDB.<p>The best thing was that people started to contribute to the project. I am really humbled that Tanc and Nic left our previous employer to build QuestDB. A few months later, former colleagues of mine left their stable low-latency jobs at banks to join us. I take this as a huge responsibility and I don’t want to let these guys down. The amount of work ahead gives me headaches and goosebumps at the same time.<p>QuestDB is deployed in production, including into a large fintech company. We’ve been focusing on building a community to get our first users and gather as much feedback as possible.<p>Thank you for reading this story - I hope it was interesting. I would love to read your feedback on QuestDB and to answer questions.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;peter-lawrey&#x2F;Java-Chronicle\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;peter-lawrey&#x2F;Java-Chronicle</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22803504\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22803504</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.agner.org&#x2F;optimize&#x2F;vectorclass.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.agner.org&#x2F;optimize&#x2F;vectorclass.pdf</a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;questdb&#x2F;questdb&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;core&#x2F;src&#x2F;main&#x2F;c&#x2F;share&#x2F;rosti.h\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;questdb&#x2F;questdb&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;core&#x2F;src&#x2F;main...</a><p>[5] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23616878\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23616878</a><p>[6] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;try.questdb.io:9000&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;try.questdb.io:9000&#x2F;</a>","time":1595944632,"title":"Launch HN: QuestDB (YC S20) – Fast open source time series database","type":"story"},{"by":"jbegley","descendants":4,"id":23975710,"kids":[23977362,23976237],"score":10,"time":1595944126,"title":"A Massive Leak of Nintendo Source Code Is Causing Chaos in Video Games","type":"story","url":"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7kp7bx/a-massive-leak-of-nintendo-source-code-is-causing-chaos-in-video-games"},{"by":"ritchiea","descendants":30,"id":23975694,"kids":[23976395,23976462,23976431,23981136,23979316,23978142,23978952,23978017,23976631],"score":17,"text":"I&#x27;m starting a new project as a technical lead.

I would like to create a new movie rating system, that will be easy to pick the right movies.","time":1595913760,"title":"Ask HN: An alternative to IMDB scores, whats a better way to pick movies?","type":"story"},{"by":"onetimemanytime","descendants":227,"id":23972561,"kids":[23972857,23974835,23972968,23973249,23973070,23972967,23973278,23974618,23973725,23977601,23977395,23974153,23973309,23979342,23975096,23979138,23976607,23974897,23976223,23973084,23973853,23973282],"score":208,"time":1595914051,"title":"11M households could be evicted over the next four months","type":"story","url":"https://www.fastcompany.com/90532305/11-million-households-could-be-evicted-over-the-next-four-months"},{"by":"Siderite","descendants":1,"id":23972482,"kids":[23976043,23972483],"score":3,"time":1595913041,"title":"Towards generic high performance sorting algorithms","type":"story","url":"https://siderite.dev/blog/towards-generic-high-performance-sorting-algorithm/"},{"by":"apsec112","descendants":53,"id":23972455,"kids":[23973098,23972827,23972859,23972787,23972945,23973207,23973130,23973359,23972876,23973310,23973452,23973412,23972775,23973364,23972860,23972848,23972905,23972916,23973227],"score":47,"time":1595912756,"title":"Quit Twitter (2019)","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/swlh/why-you-should-quit-twitter-9b93396def2d"},{"by":"apsec112","descendants":214,"id":23972391,"kids":[23973110,23974326,23972997,23972833,23974425,23973790,23974189,23975083,23978301,23975733,23975421,23979043,23976401,23977020,23972931,23974256,23977245,23972953,23972789,23986932,23975268,23982384,23976819,23975202,23979711,23975036,23975263,23974945],"score":267,"time":1595911923,"title":"The Toxoplasma of Rage (2014)","type":"story","url":"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/"},{"by":"smattiso","descendants":4,"id":23972223,"kids":[23975250,23972430,23978416,23972433],"score":2,"text":"I am starting to hire a few positions for my company.

I want to get more perspective from the realtors and the buyers in this thread.<p>Currently, when buyers interest in a property (from the photos) they are connecting with the realtors to visit that place. To make faster this process some third-party companies created a solution 10 years ago (maybe) as 3D Tour. Buyers can visit places online like they are inside of the home without going there. (e.g. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vpix.net&#x2F;754104)<p>The price of 3D Tours is quite expensive and needs lots of equipment.

We have to pay some money to a third-party company for all of them. That means we can&#x27;t do this thing for every property because it&#x27;s expensive.<p>Alternative of 3D Tour: 3D Photos? Why it&#x27;s necessary? We can give to people a video for each room. So we don&#x27;t need professional people. We only need someone who can use a photo machine to record all room videos. (Each room will be 1 minute)<p>What if the users can use a screen like that instead of 3D tours experience?<p>* My main purpose is to minimize all requirements of 3D Tours and ensure online tours as many people as possible.<p>* They can ask a question while they are doing their tours.<p>* They will be able to see all details of the room as a content while they are watching the video of the room.<p>* They can pass other rooms easily.<p>Guys - I&#x27;m a developer.

We help teens feel better, build skills for life and achieve their goals through online counseling. Our licensed counselors provide evidence-based counseling to teens through online video sessions, messaging, and a mobile app.<p>The evidence supports that behavioral therapy like CBT and DBT is effective. It works to treat diagnosable conditions like anxiety and depression, and it also works to help young people feel happier and achieve their goals [1][2][3][4][5]. But too often teens don&#x27;t get the mental health support they need because it is stigmatized, difficult to schedule and attend, and expensive. At Daybreak we bring counseling to the teen on a digital device and we charge less than half the cost of a traditional therapy session.<p>In October of 2018, my younger brother nearly lost his life due to the lack of accessible mental health resources supporting our young people. He is not alone. 1 in 5 teens struggle with a diagnosable mental health condition, but estimates suggest that up to 1 in 3 actually struggle with anxiety - or between 6 and 10M total teens [6][7]. That means the odds are greater than 50% that if you are the average parent raising a family in America with 2 kids, one of your children will struggle with a mental health condition in their teens.<p>To make matters worse, 80% of teens who need mental health support do not receive care today [8]. This results in deteriorating academic performance, increased rates of juvenile crime and substance abuse, and suicide rates that are at an all-time high. Every day, 17 young people commit suicide in the US. It is the #2 cause of death among 15-24 year olds, after accidental injury and ahead of homicide [9]. This isn&#x27;t a niche problem.<p>Our current system makes mental health support nearly impossible to get for a teen. Stigma makes it hard to admit to yourself you want support, let alone talk about it with your parents. There is a shortage of therapists who specialize in adolescents, making it hard to find a therapist that is close enough to drive to on a weekly basis. Private practice therapy averages more than $200 per session. Even if you could afford to pay, you&#x27;re going to be met with 2-3 month wait lists. And when you finally do arrive, you sit on an awkward couch in an environment that you may not be comfortable in.  That is why an average of 11 years pass between when a teenager first needs mental health support and when they eventually start receiving it in their 20s or even later [10].<p>That is why we started Daybreak Health. Everything we’ve built is designed intentionally for teens and their parents.  Teens can download the Daybreak mobile app and are instantly connected to a live guide (Mon-Fri 7am-7pm) who asks about mental health goals and needs.  After a video assessment where we loop in the parent, we create a plan and match teens with a counselor based on goals, needs, interests, hobbies and more.  Once matched with a counselor, teens meet with them once a week through a 50-minute video call, and can message them on a daily basis through the app.   Our counselors help teens develop emotional life skills and work towards goals in a personalized plan that has thematic focus on teen-specific areas like school, healthy relationships and more.  Teens can also meet with small moderated groups of other teens on those same topics.  And parents are a core part of the process, starting with the assessment, through planning and regular progress reports.  For all of this we charge an $89&#x2F;week subscription, less than half the price of a single 50-minute session in traditional private practice.<p>Dr. Neha Chaudhary, our lead Clinical Advisor, is a foremost expert on adolescent mental health and co-founder of Stanford&#x27;s Lab for Mental Health Innovation. Together with her and experts from UCSF we have designed a program for teens grounded in clinical science, while at the same time reimagining the way it is delivered to teens.  The core of our clinical program is rooted in evidence-based methods like DBT and CBT, but we have taken these approaches and brought them into an easily digestible online experience.<p>But there is a problem: stigma around mental health stops people from sharing their great experiences with counseling, so its benefit is under-appreciated. If you know any parent or teens who might benefit from counseling, make sure they know about its benefits. And if you have thoughts about how to solve the awareness problem, or any stories you can share that may help us better understand the needs of teens and parents, we would be grateful.

HN,<p>I&#x27;m a software engineer with ~5 years of experience in the industry turned newly-appointed engineering manager.  I manage a small group of people, each with their own projects, while I continue to have my own engineering projects that I contribute to in parallel to my managing duties.<p>One of the people I manage is having difficulties in their position.  Although I am not a doctor, I am fairly certain that this person is high functioning on the autism spectrum (what might otherwise be diagnosed as Asperger&#x27;s.)  I say this only because I myself am diagnosed as Asperger&#x27;s, and I see many of this person&#x27;s behaviors in a younger version of myself.  Despite the similarities, I&#x27;m unsure how to help them.  They are a wonderful caring person with clearly very strong technical abilities, but are being held back in their career by certain difficulties.<p>They&#x27;re having problems with task management and stress.  They will take an inordinate amount of time to complete otherwise simple tasks, rehashing work that has already been completed for the sake of organizing it in a way that is pleasing to them (formatting, commenting, etc.) rather than working on the deliverable objectives of the project.  This leads to delays, which causes increased stress, which in turn causes more delays.  This sets up a feedback loop that ends in them &quot;shutting down&quot; and that eventually requires intervention.<p>I&#x27;ve tried being a mentor to this person and helping them improve in these problem areas, but the advice or constructive criticism I&#x27;ve been giving on how to manage these issues does not seem to be helping.  Are there any good resources for learning how to manage people (specifically engineers) on the spectrum, or even just resources for new managers in general?

HN. Lately I have been thinking about what I really want to do in life; what really brings meaning and joy to my life. I am currently finishing up my solo &quot;start-up&quot; project, and we will see where it goes, but in the mean time I have been doing some introspection and thinking about the future.<p>I am a software developer (mostly backend, some frontend and some data analytics). I personally don&#x27;t really have any desire to work at FAANG. I also don&#x27;t really have any desire to write CRUD for some generic company that pays well either.<p>I want to explore more meaningful avenues of work. Preserving nature, animals and their habitats, is one cause I have been thinking about. I know that most projects are very hands-on, requiring mostly hard labour or specialised research efforts. However, I&#x27;ve been wondering if there is a demand for software in these projects? Particularly in terms of specialised tooling and&#x2F;or data analytics?<p>I suspect that most research projects don&#x27;t have the funding to afford anything beyond the bare requirements. The same probably goes for government sponsored programmes; again, this is all speculation.<p>Does anyone have experience as a software dev in these fields? Where might one start looking ?<p>--<p>Because I am sure some people will mention it, yes, volunteering is an option. But money is an unfortunate living requirement in today&#x27;s society (unless you plan on going off-grid entirely).","time":1595593555,"title":"Ask HN: Are there any software jobs in nature/animal conservation?","type":"story"},{"by":"xoa","descendants":79,"id":23938736,"kids":[23943516,23940198,23943612,23940598,23973865,23944930,23939821,23943036],"score":107,"time":1595594332,"title":"NIST’s Post-Quantum Cryptography Program Enters ‘Selection Round’","type":"story","url":"https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2020/07/nists-post-quantum-cryptography-program-enters-selection-round"},{"by":"ingve","descendants":51,"id":23938530,"kids":[23946900,23947314,23946672,23946967,23948918,23946649,23953086,23947378,23947341],"score":76,"time":1595592777,"title":"Avoid character-by-character processing when performance matters","type":"story","url":"https://lemire.me/blog/2020/07/21/avoid-character-by-character-processing-when-performance-matters/"},{"by":"dgellow","descendants":59,"id":23938462,"kids":[23946106,23946118,23946462,23941146,23946406,23946421,23946508,23946636,23947338,23943202,23946251,23942969],"score":66,"time":1595592071,"title":"Tiny Tiny RSS","type":"story","url":"https://tt-rss.org/"},{"by":"tech-historian","descendants":154,"id":23938449,"kids":[23944813,23942852,23945080,23944634,23943319,23943804,23941219,23945197,23941545,23944433,23941695,23941680,23945119,23944031,23945711],"score":186,"time":1595591970,"title":"Apple for the first time makes a top-of-the-line iPhone model in India","type":"story","url":"https://m.economictimes.com/tech/hardware/the-i-in-iphone-11-now-stands-for-india-made/articleshow/77135725.cms"},{"by":"Kinrany","descendants":177,"id":23938421,"kids":[23947575,23948970,23947288,23947619,23947096,23943218,23947011,23943123,23948002,23947302,23948696,23944792,23947094,23949401,23946862,23949920,23949050,23944308,23948186,23947289,23948192,23947711,23950412,23948764,23947967,23946815,23953759,23949898,23946840,23941960,23948832,23947200,23949550,23950507,23948953,23947909,23948313,23948801,23947940,23948671,23948554,23946918,23949666,23949177,23941765],"score":177,"time":1595591801,"title":"Dividing front end from back end is an antipattern","type":"story","url":"https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/dividing-frontend-backend-antipattern"},{"by":"maxrand","descendants":6,"id":23938171,"kids":[23941933,23938221,23938195],"score":9,"time":1595590091,"title":"Show HN: Grow42 – 5 startup links everyday","type":"story","url":"https://grow42.com/"},{"by":"GordonS","descendants":62,"id":23938124,"kids":[23953963,23953886,23953994,23954612,23954924,23953941,23953805],"score":77,"time":1595589617,"title":"Building the ultimate home office again","type":"story","url":"https://www.troyhunt.com/building-the-ultimate-home-office-again/"},{"by":"thereyougo","descendants":5,"id":23938092,"kids":[23944475,23938997,23945052,23945077,23944439],"score":35,"time":1595589258,"title":"Seven people who hold the keys to worldwide internet security (2014)","type":"story","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/28/seven-people-keys-worldwide-internet-security-web"},{"by":"HugThem","descendants":22,"id":23937996,"kids":[23939882,23938885,23941785,23942640,23948875,23940553,23949958,23938192,23939413,23939893,23943062,23946869,23945046,23938013,23947557,23940290,23940220,23938578,23939107,23947656],"score":13,"time":1595588461,"title":"Ask HN: What are you doing this weekend?","type":"story"},{"by":"somishere","descendants":215,"id":23938007,"kids":[23938323,23938110,23939394,23939867,23938930,23938365,23942503,23940080,23938726,23938761,23938797,23938803,23938940,23938264,23941204,23939065,23939709,23938689,23940516,23938971,23940173,23942405,23939475,23948063,23938144,23938256,23947087,23941187,23938882,23940229,23939313,24027165,23938809,23943368,23938492,23939026,23939741,23939759,23939153,23938081,23939511,23942352,23941296,23941458,23938379,23938567,23941447,23938401,23938633,23938728,23938145,23950547,23938800,23939501,23938850,23940796,23938496,23939011,23941308,23941397,23942459,23943520,23940523,23938070,23954227,23939859,23941381,23941986,23942985,23943188,23941599,23938501,23938297,23939739,23943514,23943198,23938902,23938205,23942984,23939062,23941477,23938204],"score":333,"text":"I&#x27;ve been offline since last Wednesday, driving and camping throughout northern outback australia (escaping the vid!).

Over time, many non-technical tasks have fallen into my lap because PC has consistently missed deadlines and meetings, delivered sub-par work product (e.g. writing riddled with spelling and grammatical mistakes, misrepresentation of our product to potential investors, spreadsheets with completely incorrect calculations), and hasn&#x27;t taken the initiative to learn on the job like me or my other co-founder (OC).<p>OC and I have had many conversations with PC about this, and we&#x27;ve been met with an acknowledgment and a promise to do better, but things rapidly devolve again. I&#x27;ve completely lost trust in PC, and ordinarily I feel this would not have been tolerated at other companies.<p>Problem is: OC and I are pretty much operating at 100%, and PC does do work. It&#x27;s usually not great, and the output per time&#x2F;money spent is low, but it&#x27;s work.

Sidekick is a new hardware device built to connect remote teams with an always-on video call.<p>Sidekick sits on your desk next to your computer — with Sidekick you just turn to your teammates and talk, as if you&#x27;re in the same room.<p>Like many of you all, we were recently forced to start working remotely because of COVID. After fleeing NYC to return to our childhood homes, we quickly realized that starting a company while remote was brutal. We were missing out on all the spontaneous conversations and camaraderie that occur when we&#x27;re in the same room. We knew we needed to simulate being in the same room to build our company.<p>Initially we built Sidekick just for ourselves, but many of the founders in our YC batch wanted to try it out! We realized that our founding team wasn&#x27;t an anomaly for wanting an always-on video device — we pivoted from our previous idea to start working on Sidekick to help the other founders in our batch.<p>Sidekick works best with fast-paced teams that need to be constantly communicating — founders are a great example. We&#x27;re working with 25 YC founding teams along with experimental product teams at Store No. 8 and Brex. That being said, Sidekick isn&#x27;t for everyone! If you don&#x27;t really want to talk to your team during the day, Sidekick probably isn&#x27;t a great fit.<p>We talked to many teams that tried to hack together a solution with Zoom on an iPad. From the teams we spoke to, we learned that it&#x27;s really hard to consistently get the team in the room at the same time. Users are constantly leaving the room for other meetings but for everyone still in the room, it seems like nobody wants to use it because it&#x27;s empty. This causes a negative feedback loop where even more people leave the room and the hacked together solution quickly becomes useless.<p>Sidekick is built to maximize the chances that you&#x27;re not in the room alone. Unlike other jerry-rigged solutions, it treats &quot;always-on&quot; as a first-class problem to solve. Some examples of product decisions we&#x27;ve made are:<p>- Push notifications to minimize being alone in the room - when someone joins as the first person in the room, we send a notification to the rest of the team. We want to get other teammates in the room ASAP because the room is only useful with more than one person.<p>- Meeting mode - when you have a normal Zoom meeting with someone outside of your team, you can mark yourself as &quot;in a meeting&quot;. This silences the mic and speakers on Sidekick while also setting a status informing your team that you&#x27;re in a meeting, but you&#x27;ll be back soon if someone needs you. We&#x27;re also releasing Google Calendar integration soon, allowing Sidekick to automatically mark itself as &quot;in a meeting&quot;<p>On average our users are in their Sidekick rooms for 6 hours a day. They turn it on first thing when they sit down in the morning and leave it on throughout all their meetings during the day.<p>Our customers pay for Sidekick with a subscription model and we have a special promotion until Aug 1st for $25&#x2F;user&#x2F;month. The hardware comes for free and we handle all the shipping. We went with this model because we want our customers to pay us for the experience, not the hardware. We didn&#x27;t want customers to have to think about whether they wanted to buy a pricy new device when the real question should be whether they want to try the experience.<p>We believe that working in the same room is part of the secret sauce to building an awesome company. We want all teams to be able to have access to that experience.<p>I really love this community and I&#x27;m excited to share Sidekick with all of you.

We&#x27;re Jay and Himank from Reploy (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getreploy.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getreploy.com</a>). We&#x27;re building a platform that allows teams to easily configure full-stack staging environments or &quot;previews&quot; of their web app which are created on every open PR.<p>In the past, Himank and I spent time at several startups (~10-&gt;200 employees), where we were on customer-facing, product-oriented teams. We often found ourselves in positions where we wanted to share our environment with designer&#x2F;PM&#x2F;sales folks who didn&#x27;t necessarily have a dev environment setup, and ngrok didn&#x27;t cut it.  Further, even when trying to share our environment with fellow engineers, there was always a slow down when requiring that they git stash, git pull, etc..<p>The solution to these pain points was either:<p>1) Waiting for a full staging or production deployment, which in most cases, wasn&#x27;t really practical (from a cost and&#x2F;or time perspective).<p>2) Using a static site hosting solution (Vercel, Netlify, etc..) which didn&#x27;t allow us to preview full-stack changes.<p>At some of these companies, an infra team had tried to build something like this, however, the &quot;preview&quot; workflow was very different than the &quot;production&quot; workflow, so there were annoyances (slow builds, lack of concurrent env support, no populating staging data etc..) that made the tool hard to use. This is where Reploy comes in! Especially in the current remote landscape, being able to have as many staging environments as features is helping teams move faster by simplifying and streamlining the feature development flow.<p>We&#x27;ve put a lot of time into making this dead simple to set up. Just connect your repo, give us the commands that you run on your dev machine, and we&#x27;ll spit out a live environment on a managed link. All of this configuration can be described in the `reploy.yml` file, which is essentially a simpler version of docker-compose :). And if you already have a docker-compose file, we can use that as well :).<p>Take a look at a demo on our site! (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getreploy.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getreploy.com</a>).<p>How does it work you may ask? The short answer is k8s. We schedule these environments on Kubernetes, however, we hide this from end-users so that all that they&#x27;re interacting with is the Reploy configuration (just a series of commands to start up your web app). We&#x27;ve also curated a bunch of &quot;runtimes&quot;  which contain common framework dependencies (reactjs, node, rails, etc..) so that if you don&#x27;t want to worry about docker, you don&#x27;t have to :) . And for the hardcore folks out there, we also support custom images.<p>A few notable features that Reploy offers (specific to the aforementioned &quot;staging&quot; workflow):<p>1) Caching of specific directories (node_modules, .bundle, etc..) -&gt; faster builds<p>2) Restarts of past environments -&gt; Let&#x27;s you compare the state of different commits<p>3) Notifications! -&gt; We&#x27;ll notify your team when a new environment is ready or failed the build process via slack, email, etc..<p>4) A &quot;setup&quot; hook where your team can populate a database with staging data, or configure the host environment to your liking.<p>From a pricing angle, we&#x27;re looking to charge like most CI providers. That is, we&#x27;ll charge a base price per engineer&#x2F;user (~$30) and prorate any additional usage over a max number of concurrent environments. On that note, we&#x27;ve realized that pricing for Reploy is a very interesting problem, as the types of users that are creating environments (engineers, devops teams, etc..) are not necessarily the only users getting value out of the product (PMs, for example).

I started doing data entry but I&#x27;ve worked my way up and I&#x27;m now basically the Operations Manager.<p>- I&#x27;m burned out, I&#x27;ve hit a roof for earning potential, and I really REALLY don&#x27;t enjoy the work. It&#x27;s soul crushing.<p>- The IT work that I do there, while minor (networking issues, setting up new users, etc), is about the only thing I enjoy anymore.<p>- I earn 60K a year. Low roof, huh? At least as far as Los Angeles COL goes.<p>- I have an 18-month old boy who takes up a lot of my time. Especially now that his daycare is closed due to Covid.<p>- Recently, after years of struggling to focus on any kind of new career direction in my downtime, my wife finally had enough and asked me to go talk to a therapist and&#x2F;or psychiatrist. This resulted in something I&#x27;d suspected for a long time– an ADHD diagnosis. This has made me hopeful but also extremely sad about all the time I&#x27;ve wasted.<p>- Along with therapy, some behavior shifts and the use of medication, I find myself being able to sustain focus on all manner of things that I never could before, so it&#x27;s time to knuckle down and start making moves.<p>I&#x27;m interested in becoming a systems administrator but I have some concerns about may age, my lack of degree, lack of experience, to name just a few. Am I kidding myself by attempting to go down this road? Is it too late for a career change? Are certifications worth pursuing (CompTIA, RHCSA, AWS, etc)? How future proof is it as a career?<p>Any guidance is much appreciated.

But they are worried about the security of the system that they are using.<p>I put in the URL for the POS system into the ssllabs.com tests and sure enough, it scores an &quot;F&quot;, runs TLS 1.0, etc.<p>What makes matters more complicated is that there has been some chargeback fraud happening.

Jon, and Ashby here, the co-founders of Charityvest (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;charityvest.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;charityvest.org</a>). We created a modern, simple, and affordable way for companies to include charitable giving in their suite of employee benefits.<p>We give employees their own tax-deductible charitable giving fund, like an “HSA for Charity.” They can make contributions into their fund and, from their fund, support any of the 1.4M charities in the US, all on one tax receipt.<p>Using the funds, we enable companies to operate gift matching programs that run on autopilot. Each donation to a charity from an employee is matched automatically by the company in our system.<p>A company can set up a matching gift program and launch giving funds to employees in about 10 minutes of work.<p>Historically, corporate charitable giving matching programs have been administratively painful to operate. Making payments to charities, maintaining tax records, and doing due diligence on charitable compliance is taxing on HR &#x2F; finance teams. The necessary software to help has historically been quite expensive and not very useful for employees beyond the matching features.<p>This is one example of an observation Stephen made after working for years as a philanthropic consultant. Consumer fintech products aren’t built to make great giving experiences for donors. Instead, they are built for buyers — e.g., nonprofits (fundraising) or corporations (gift matching) — without a ton of consideration for the everyday user experience.<p>A few years back, my wife and I made a commitment to give a portion of our income away every year, and we found it administratively painful to give regularly. The tech that nonprofits typically use hardly inspires generosity — e.g., high fees, poor user flows, and questionable information flow (like tax receipts). Giving platforms try to compensate for poor functionality with bright pictures of happy kids in developing countries, but when the technology is not a good financial experience it puts a damper on things.<p>Charityvest started when I noticed a particular opportunity with donor-advised funds, which are tax-deductible giving funds recognized by the IRS. They are growing quickly (20% CAGR), but mainly among the high-net worth demographic. We believe they are powerful tools. They enable donors to have a giving portfolio all from one place (on one tax receipt) and have full control over their payment information&#x2F;frequency, etc. Most of all, they enable a donor to split the decisions of committing to give and supporting a specific organization. Excitement about each of these decisions often strikes at different times for donors—particularly those who desire to give on a budget.<p>We believe everyone should have their own charitable giving fund no matter their net worth. We’ve created technology that has democratized donor-advised funds.<p>We also believe good technology should be available for every company, big and small. Employers can offer Charityvest for $2.49 &#x2F; employee &#x2F; month subscription, and we charge no fees on any of the giving — charities receive 100% of the money given.<p>Lastly, we send the program administrator a fun report every month to let them know all the awesome giving their company and its employees did in one dashboard. This info can be leveraged for internal culture or external brand building.<p>We’re just launching our workplace giving product, but we’ve already built a good portfolio of trusted customers, including Eric Ries’ (author of The Lean Startup) company, LTSE. We’ve particularly seen a number of companies use us as a meaningful part of their corporate decision to join the fight for racial justice in substantive ways.<p>Our endgame is that the world becomes more generous, starting with the culture of every company. We believe giving is fundamentally good and we want to build technology that encourages more of it by making it more simple and accessible.<p>You can check out our workplace giving product at (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;charityvest.org&#x2F;workplace-giving\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;charityvest.org&#x2F;workplace-giving</a>). If you’re interested, we can get your company up and running in 10 minutes. Or, please feel free to forward us on to your HR leadership at your company.<p>Our giving funds are also available for free for any individual on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;charityvest.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;charityvest.org</a> — without gift matching and reporting. We’d invite you to check out the experience.

an invite to a phone interview at ThoughtWorks next week and I wonder if that&#x27;s a good opportunity or not.<p>From what I perceive, they have a reputation in outstanding practices and an interesting choice of tech stacks. Also, they do consultancy, so the tasks are never the same (I wasn&#x27;t able to work on the same product for more than two years in the past).<p>So, the setting I imagine from the limited info I have, would be perfect for me. Could you provide some more info, such as insights as an employee or customer of TW?<p>What is the general (int&#x27;l) tech industry perception of TW alumni?<p>What are the career perspective in such a consultancy?<p>Two concerns about TW rose:<p>- First, did the sale to private equity firm have a significant impact? Is TW still reputable in what and how they do it?<p>- Second, I read that &quot;social justice&quot; would take a third of their interview process. I certainly respect what they do, but I would consider myself a bit more on the conservative side. For example, I believe that helping people in need is an act of decency (and I am engaged in non-profits for that reason), but I doubt that this kind of compassionate behavior should be &quot;enforced&quot; on &quot;the rich&quot; by the government, also I do believe that equality of opportunity should be top priority for a society, but economical equality (&quot;redistribution of wealth&quot;) should not be the desired outcome.

After every deployment, a bunch of our developers would manually smoke test the application by running through all of the critical user experiences. This manual testing was expensive in terms of our time. To speed up the tests’ run time, we dedicated developer resources to writing and managing Selenium scripts. That was expensive at “compile time” due to authoring and maintenance.  At a high-level, we believe that the problem with automated end-to-end testing comes down to two things: tests are too hard to create, and they take too much time to maintain. These are the two issues we are trying to solve with Reflect.<p>Reflect lets you create end-to-end tests just by using your web application, and then executes that test definition whenever you want: on a schedule, via API trigger or simply on-demand. It emails you whenever the test fails and provides a video and the browser logs of the execution.<p>One knee-jerk reaction we’re well aware of: record-and-playback testing tools, where the user creates a test automatically by interacting with their web application, have traditionally not worked very well. We’re taking a new approach by loading the site-under-test inside of a VM in the cloud rather than rely on a locally installed browser extension. This eliminates a class of recording errors due to existing cookies, proxies or other extensions introducing state that the test executor is not aware of, and unifies the test creation environment with the test execution environment.  By completely controlling the test environment we can also expose a better UX for certain actions.  For example, to do visual testing you just click-and-drag over the element(s) you want to test.  For recording file uploads we intercept the upload request in the VM, prompt you to upload a file from your local file system, and then store that file in the cloud and inject it into the running test.  If you want to add additional steps to an existing test, we’ll put you back into the recording experience and fast-forward you to that point in the test, where again all you need to do is use your site and we’ll add those actions to your existing test.   Controlling the environment also allows us to reduce the problem space by blocking actions which you typically wouldn’t want to test, but which are hard to replicate and thus could lead to failed recordings (e.g. changing browser dimensions mid-recording). As an added bonus, our approach requires no installation whatsoever!<p>We capture nearly every browser action from hovers to file uploads, and drag-and-drops to iframes, while building a repeatable, machine-executable test definition. We support variables for dynamic inputs, and test composition so your test suite is DRY. The API provides flexible integration with your CI&#x2F;CD out of the box and supports creating tests in prod and running them in staging on the fly.  You don’t need to use a separate test grid, as all Reflect tests run on our own infrastructure. Parallel execution of your tests is a two click config change and we don’t charge you extra for it.<p>Some technical details that folks might find interesting:<p>- For every action you take we’ll generate multiple selectors targeting the element you interacted with.  We wrote a custom algorithm that generates a diverse set of selectors (so that if you delete a class in the future your tests won’t break), and ranks them by specificity (i.e. [data-test-id] &gt; img[alt=”foo”] &gt; #bar &gt; .baz).<p>- To detect certain actions we have to track DOM mutations across async boundaries.  So for example we can detect if a hover ended up mutating an element you clicked on and thus should be captured as a test step, even if the hover occurred within a requestAnimationFrame, XHR&#x2F;fetch callback, setTimeout&#x2F;setInterval, etc.<p>- We detect and ignore auto-genned classes from libraries like Styled Components.  We use a heuristic to do this so it’s not perfect, but this approach allows us to generate higher quality selectors than if we didn’t ignore them.<p>- One feature in beta that we’re really excited about: For React apps we have the ability to target React component names as if they were DOM elements (e.g. if you click on a button you might get a selector like “&lt;NotificationPopupMenu&gt; button”).  We think this is the best solution for the auto-genned classes problem described in the bullet above, as selectors containing component names should be very stable.<p>We tried to make Reflect as easy as possible to get started with - we have a free tier (no credit card required) and there’s nothing to install. Our paid plans start at $99 and you pay primarily for test execution time.

Traditionally, apps are protected via 2FA, network restrictions, logs auditing and access control. However, those are not enough to minimise the biggest risk - humans.<p>Employees can:<p>1) Be socially engineered into giving their credentials, even bypassing 2FA<p>2) Be bribed or get frustrated into &quot;acting badly&quot;. I assume they hope to get away by making it look like they were &quot;hacked&quot;.<p>A SOLUTION<p>- Mitigating login attacks: The idea is to prevent attackers from using the tool even if login is compromised. To achieve this, we must tie the usage of the app to a specific device for each employee[1]. Doing so will not allow any other device to login. This is OK from an employee workflow point of view since they don&#x27;t switch machines anyway. It also makes it very difficult for malicious employees to fake that they were hacked.<p>- Mitigating insider threats: Assigning strict access controls and having sensitive actions be approved by multiple people in the organisation reduces the risk of a single point of failure.<p>- Logging + analytics: All actions an employee takes must be logged, making auditing easy post an attack. One can even build ML models to detect anomalous behaviour and stop bad actors in real time.<p>DISCUSSION<p>- Is anything that I have assumed wrong?<p>- Any thoughts on the above solutions?<p>- How do you think the Twitter attackers bypassed 2FA?<p>Thank you for your time.<p>---------------<p>[1] How to tie usage of the app to one device per employee:<p>- Post login, the app must allow only one alive session for that user (i.e. no new session can be created). This means that using login credentials on another browser won&#x27;t work.<p>- No log outs allowed.<p>- Sessions need to be safeguarded against theft (see RFC: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2ZHuPji).

You and I (even animals) understand time by being present here and now. We can rely on our memory to know what happened before, but we don&#x27;t confuse right now with the past.

The newest feed from its sensors could define the now, or the last line of the database. But with perfect recall, why would the conscious program choose to stay there?

Don&#x27;t comment on bodies (many cofs have an active lifestyle and like to talk about their body). Don&#x27;t tease&#x2F;flirt.

We create mobile apps to help people manage chronic health conditions at home. Our programs use hypnosis-based techniques, developed by clinicians, to help people manage conditions like anxiety, depression &amp; Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).<p>Mindset Health came out of a difficult period after Chris and I wound down our first startup. During this time, we experienced a lot of anxiety and stress. I ended up being prescribed anti-anxiety medication, but the side effects and the lack of control I felt caused me to look for non-pharmacological options, like CBT and biofeedback.<p>Someone we trusted recommended hypnotherapy. Chris and I were skeptical about hypnosis (the &#x27;being made to cluck like a chicken&#x27; reputation), but after coming around to the benefits of meditation a couple of years before, we were open enough to say we&#x27;d look more into the science. We ended up spending a few weeks diving deep into the hypnosis research and were surprised at what we found. Since many HN readers are probably as skeptical as we were, we&#x27;re going to saturate the rest of this post with references. Hopefully not too many!<p>Contrary to stereotypes of stage shows with outlandish mind control stunts, hypnosis simply involves becoming focused enough to become more receptive to new ideas or perspectives. Turns out that not only can this help with areas like smoking cessation [1], but conditions like anxiety [2], depression [3], IBS [4], sleep issues [5] and chronic pain [6] can be improved using hypnosis-based treatments. Like many topics in neuroscience, the mechanisms behind hypnosis are still being explored, but a 2016 brain scan study by the Stanford School of Medicine identified changes in brain activity related to absorption, executive control, and awareness [7] which is thought to create a more effective context for the delivery of therapeutic techniques like CBT [8].<p>It took some time but we decided to look into booking sessions with local &#x27;hypnotherapists&#x27; to try it for ourselves. However, many of the people we came across weren&#x27;t psychologists or qualified practitioners, and most of this wasn&#x27;t covered by insurance. So we switched to trying pre-recorded sessions from a well-regarded psychologist who practices hypnosis. Those sessions were deeply relaxing and absorbing. Through using them I was able to learn coping skills helped me stop taking my anxiety medication.<p>This experience gave Chris and me an idea: could we help more people access hypnotherapy by removing the stigma and barriers to trying it? Calm and Headspace had succeeded at doing so for meditation. Similarly to how meditation has become a powerful self-care habit for a healthy mind, perhaps hypnotherapy could become a tool for self-managing chronic health conditions.<p>Chronic and mental health conditions account for a massive portion of the global healthcare cost (80–90% of the $3.5 trillion annual healthcare spend in the United States [9,10]). For many of these conditions, treatment is more about managing symptoms than &#x27;curing&#x27; the condition, meaning that patients are reliant on drugs, surgeries, and&#x2F;or restrictive diets for long periods of their life - with all of the cost and side effects involved.<p>We decided to make our idea into reality, and began Mindset Health with the intention of helping people with these conditions strengthen their self-regulation skills and reduce reliance on pharmacological interventions. We currently have two apps that use hypnotherapy to help people manage health conditions (with more on the way, including chronic pain and smoking cessation).<p>The first app is called Mindset (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mindsethealth.com&#x2F;mindset\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mindsethealth.com&#x2F;mindset</a>), which is based on the work of Dr Michael Yapko, an expert in the clinical uses of hypnosis (he literally wrote the textbook) [11]. It involves a series of hypnosis-based audio sessions that teach coping skills that can help manage anxiety and depression. Each hypnotherapy session dives into a specific thought pattern or life challenge and helps you improve by teaching you new skills and perspectives.<p>The second app, Nerva (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mindsethealth.com&#x2F;nerva\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mindsethealth.com&#x2F;nerva</a>), is designed for users with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (a condition affecting 10-15% of the population, so 33-49 million Americans). It&#x27;s based on the work of Dr Simone Peters, who led a randomized controlled trial that deployed a 6-week gut-directed hypnotherapy program; this approach was shown to help 71% of participants improve their symptoms by a clinically significant amount [12]. Nerva delivers this 6-week hypnotherapy approach (audio sessions that use visualization and suggestion to improve self-regulation skills, as well as sychoeducation and breathing exercises), plus a maintenance plan to help users to build on their progress.<p>From past discussions, including the recent HN thread at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23410690\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23410690</a>, we know that the topic of hypnosis can bring up a lot of understandable skepticism. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;ve included so many links below. We&#x27;re also happy to talk about it. We&#x27;ve been there ourselves, so please feel free to be skeptical, ask questions, and share your experiences in this area. We want to hear them! And if there&#x27;s anything you want to say that isn&#x27;t right for a public forum, you&#x27;re welcome to email us at founders@mindsethealth.com as well.<p>[1] <a

However, in the past few weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed a drop in traffic to the site, and when I looked at the Search Console, I realized that all traffic from Google suddenly disappeared in the middle of June: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;S1CCl2f.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;S1CCl2f.png</a><p>Google has all the pages in the site indexed - when I search for &quot;site:[my URL]&quot;, the pages show up as expected – but they seem to have been completely removed from any search results. If I search for the exact name of my app, where my site was previously the first result, the site appears nowhere in the 16 pages of results that are returned (I looked at all of them!). Similarly, if I copy a few sentences or an entire paragraph from the site and search for exact matches, Google will return irrelevant results or no results at all, and my site won&#x27;t be included anywhere in the results.<p>At least from the search console, everything appears fine - there are no errors reported, and the &quot;manual actions&quot; and &quot;security issues&quot; sections are empty. The site content has barely changed in the last few months, so I can&#x27;t see any reason for the change.<p>What can I do? There seems to be no way to contact an actual human, and since nothing on the site has changed, I can&#x27;t think of anything to revert. I could try going back to my old domain, but I&#x27;m worried that would confuse Google even more, and I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s even the source of the issue.

I had recently viewed a video showing the aftermath of a drone attack, sanctioned by the President. I was furious. There were kids screaming, adults desperately trying to pull people from the wreckage; No one looked like they deserved what they had just received. I knew I could never unsee that. So, we filled a few barrels with cement and locked our arms inside them causing traffic to be blocked on the road next to the base where drones were being piloted. I knew I had to act.<p>Hours later, they &quot;freed&quot; us and we were charged. That was fair. Later, it was ordered that we were to pay $3,200 apiece because of what it costed the State to handle that situation. I didn&#x27;t hear about it for nearly a year after the fact because I was going through deep financial struggles (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17936860). I began to get my life together (thanks to HN). Your advice helped a lot. Even the most brutal comments were meant well.<p>A couple of weeks ago I received a letter in the mail stating that I had until the end of this month to pay my fines or I&#x27;d be held in contempt. For those of you who are unfamiliar, this could mean jail-time, taking my license, etc. I&#x27;m not going to sit here and act like I&#x27;m being treated unfairly. I know for a fact that we were treated far better by the police than many of our brothers and sisters of color, historically (and today), for instance.<p>The reason I am seeking advice is mainly because I&#x27;m nearly in tears and very stressed. I can&#x27;t setup a payment plan because of Covid (they can only do it in person) and everywhere I call says it&#x27;s impossible. If anything, I&#x27;m just using this to cope with the stress.<p>Thanks, HN.<p>p.s excuse the quality, max char count is 2k<p>Proof<p>Des Moines Register - shorturl.at&#x2F;jsL17<p>Medium - shorturl.at&#x2F;nxLQ6","time":1594941780,"title":"Ask HN: I gave myself to a movement and now I'm facing the consequences.

I&#x27;m Kennan and I recently founded Jika (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jika.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jika.ai</a>). Jika helps Shopify sellers A&#x2F;B test their product pricing so they can make more money.<p>Let’s say you sell shoes on Shopify for $100 and want to test $110. You’d 1-click install the Jika Shopify App and go to a dashboard where you select and start a test for $110. We then handle the heavy lifting of showing price A to 50% of your visitors and price B to the other 50%. As the test is running, Jika keeps track of revenue, conversions, and visitors at each price point. You’d repeat this process as much as you can since the optimal price for a product is always changing.<p>Up until now, most people have priced off competitors, but that doesn&#x27;t cut it anymore with big companies getting more and more sophisticated. A prime example of this is Amazon accelerating their development of in-house brands (~640 in late 2019) and using their dataset to outprice other online sellers (2.5m price changes per day in 2013 and more today).<p>One recent test of a best selling product for a Shopify brand doing 1M+ monthly revenue resulted in a data significant ~10% revenue lift from a -7% price. This better price for the best selling product translates to a ~30k+ monthly revenue increase (~180k+ revenue over 6 months).<p>I chose to work on pricing because I love optimization.

signed up for a Chime (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chime.com) account last weekend. The first thing I did was try to find out how to turn on 2FA for my account. Not finding the setting I reached out to the company on Twitter. They replied and said that 2FA is turned on for all accounts by default. (It&#x27;s SMS based and cannot be configured to be One-Time Password based which is less than ideal but that&#x27;s not my point here.) I was confused when they told me that it was on for everyone because I was not asked for a 2F code when I logged into my account on my Mac. I reached out again and here&#x27;s first response I got back:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;JbGGXYzN<p>This was immediately concerning to me and rather confusing. What is the criteria for when it asks and when it doesn&#x27;t? Will I be lucky enough that when a bad actor obtains my credentials from a security breach that they will be asked to supply a 2F code to access my account? I tried logging in on a few more devices. I cleared cookies and caches on them and even switched to a cellular network on my phone. I was NOT asked for a 2F code on two devices (one being the cell network-connected phone) and WAS asked for a 2F code on two other devices. I replied to the support response and got this as a reply:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;BXEGeNbK<p>Am I crazy or does this completely defeat the purpose of 2FA? In my above scenario where this bad actor already has my credentials it sounds like they have free reign to my account. I practice good password habits (different passwords on every account and changing passwords immediately upon hearing about a breach) but this system still leaves me vulnerable if I don&#x27;t hear about a breach for a few days.<p>Please put my mind at ease and tell me that their 2FA system is not as bad as I think it is. If they gave me control to configure it so the system asks _every_ time I log in I wouldn&#x27;t have as much of a problem. But I don&#x27;t like this mysterious algorithm that decides when it&#x27;s going to ask for a 2F code.","time":1594831951,"title":"Ask HN: Is Chime's (online US bank) 2FA system flawed?","type":"story"},{"by":"beefhash","descendants":17,"id":23847628,"kids":[23851093,23850596,23850389,23850624,23850783,23850848,23850919,23850850,23850914,23850402,23850997],"score":56,"time":1594830814,"title":"The day I trolled the entire internet: accidental research project CVE-2020-1350","type":"story","url":"https://blog.zsec.uk/cve-2020-1350-research/"},{"by":"kossnocorp","descendants":42,"id":23847295,"kids":[23849847,23847648,23847503,23847456,23847983,23851529,23857792,23854607,23853349,23849305,23848385],"score":48,"time":1594829453,"title":"Show HN: Add what Twitter's missing - good thread editor, edit tweets and more","type":"story","url":"https://getchirrapp.com/"},{"by":"ozudan","descendants":24,"id":23847393,"kids":[23850517,23859259,23847917,23847569,23867202,23848274,23863342,23848874,23854944,23849689,23855861,23865349,23863114,23858334],"score":12,"text":"Apart from game companies and the computer graphics scene, I don&#x27;t find many C++ jobs at all.\nMost are either enlisted for languages such as Java, C#, JavaScript or Python.<p>If you find a &quot;C++&quot; keyword in a typical job listing, it will be among a list of other high-level languages.\nAnd in my experience,  you&#x27;ll soon find out that it has nothing to do with C++ programming once you got past the interview process.<p>Embedded development may seem as a last frontier for C++, but no, you won&#x27;t find it there either most of the time.\nYou&#x27;ll rather find something C-related there.\nFurthermore, someone who interviewed embedded developers told me that those types of developers tend to be bad software engineers or C++ programmers for some reason.<p>C++ jobs seem to be rather inside a niche market and many companies seem to have few use cases for it.","time":1594829811,"title":"Ask HN: C++ Dev Jobs Are Rare, Aren't They?","type":"story"},{"by":"tortilla","descendants":65,"id":23847201,"kids":[23848072,23848515,23848300,23847722,23847946,23847883,23848681,23847807,23852892,23849042,23848510,23848669,23849435,23847812,23849119,23847608,23847552,23847396,23848116,23848619],"score":37,"time":1594829114,"title":"Zoom announces a $599 touchscreen device for remote workers","type":"story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21325542/zoom-dten-me-tablet-video-calls-webcam-home-remote-work"},{"by":"e1ven","descendants":2,"id":23847097,"kids":[23851012,23848419],"score":13,"time":1594828721,"title":"The Privacy Card Issuing API","type":"story","url":"https://blog.privacy.com/introducing-the-privacy-card-issuing-api/"},{"by":"sethbannon","descendants":5,"id":23847116,"kids":[23851635,23850975,23851335],"score":33,"time":1594828771,"title":"Legal Support for Substack Writers","type":"story","url":"https://on.substack.com/p/legal-support-for-substack-writers"},{"by":"hailpixel","dead":true,"id":23846990,"kids":[23847593,23847241],"score":6,"time":1594828261,"title":"Unwoke – The job board for conservative and libertarian thinkers","type":"story","url":"https://www.unwoke.hr/"},{"by":"originof","descendants":124,"id":23846845,"kids":[23847858,23847009,23848635,23847920,23848832,23846925,23849204,23848030,23849315,23848310,23846846,23848401,23849565,23849786,23848182,23848057,23850680,23848175,23848862,23847231,23851348,23850122,23848171,23850143,23848814,23847912,23850018,23850331,23850074,23850259,23850463,23848227],"score":166,"time":1594827768,"title":"GitHub was down again","type":"story","url":"https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/phnch1rww464"},{"by":"bookofjoe","descendants":2,"id":23846811,"kids":[23855717,23846825],"score":3,"time":1594827628,"title":"Sunlight on laser-etched metal purifies contaminated H2O w over 100% efficiency","type":"story","url":"https://scitechdaily.com/laser-etched-metal-purifies-contaminated-water-using-sunlight-with-greater-than-100-efficiency/"},{"by":"ryanmccullagh","descendants":370,"id":23846654,"kids":[23847302,23848441,23847195,23847901,23849112,23851933,23848397,23847357,23848154,23856256,23851152,23847947,23850368,23872106,23847893,23856977,23847163,23878179,23855130,23856380,23847611,23847750,23856059,23847561,23853388,23849724,23849240,23848095,23847185,23847388,23848731,23848620,23849150,23848255,23848575,23847502,23847727,23847532,23847460,23850803,23847954,23847401,23848770,23847184,23847183],"score":428,"time":1594826986,"title":"Co-founder of Gokada found decapitated, dismembered inside New York condo","type":"story","url":"https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/ny-headless-torso-found-manhattan-20200714-rz25uxzsejgrxnsk4rd22vf7hq-story.html"},{"by":"actfrench","descendants":7,"id":23846538,"kids":[23846841,23850884],"score":7,"text":"A lot of kids have been feeling really isolated during this time of social distancing.

We help men become fathers through sperm testing, sperm improvement, and sperm freezing.<p>To do this, we built an at-home sperm testing kit. Using our kit and courier services, we receive your semen sample at our labs. From there, we analyze your semen for a variety of parameters, most notably count, volume, concentration, motility, and morphology. This helps you understand your fertility.<p>If the analysis concludes that your sperm are healthy, we then offer you the option to freeze at rates more competitive than a traditional clinic. If we find low counts or poor motility (the sperm&#x27;s ability to swim), we&#x27;ll provide you with lifestyle recommendations based on your analysis and a survey you completed. If necessary, we&#x27;ll connect you with our urologist on staff or a reputable fertility doctor in your area.<p>Men often assume they&#x27;ll have no issue procreating. We also often assume we can have healthy kids at any age. But these assumptions aren&#x27;t always true. In fact, approximately 1 in 10 men face infertility, as do approximately 1 in 7 couples. In each case, infertility is medically defined as &quot;not being able to conceive within 12 months of actively trying.&quot; What&#x27;s equally important is your ability to produce healthy sperm is not necessarily permanent. Things like testicular cancer, dangerous careers, or serious accidents do happen and as you get older, the quality of your sperm declines each year.<p>I didn&#x27;t plan on starting a male fertility company. A few years ago, I had an accident that led to second degree burns on my thighs from some very, very hot tea. At the time, I was just grateful to not have had any permanent damage. But when a friend was diagnosed with cancer and froze his sperm before starting chemotherapy, I decided to proactively freeze my sperm, and that&#x27;s when I realized just how much the process of testing or freezing your sperm today sucks (I am more than happy to talk details about this!)<p>My work experience was extremely helpful in starting a company like Legacy. I worked at Oliver Wyman as a Health &amp; Life Sciences consultant, studied public health and public policy at Harvard, met with successful entrepreneurs through the World Economic Forum, and learned a lot at UN Women about how the world thinks about fertility and family planning.<p>The timing also made sense. In 2017, a major meta-study was released, showing that male fertility had declined 50-60% in the past 40 years. And society is changing! People are older. Couples meet later. They get married later. They try to have kids later. Non-traditional families are much more common than they used to be. Men no longer see themselves as the hands-off breadwinners, but want to be actively involved in raising healthy kids with good values - I know I do.<p>Even if you don&#x27;t know whether you want kids, if you&#x27;ve at least thought about having kids one day, we can help you understand your fertility and ensure that you have a strong viable sperm sample for future use. Plus: your sperm quality is a great overall indicator for your health, so you&#x27;ll get an important insight into how healthy you are today.<p>I&#x27;ve been part of the HN community ever since I decided to become an entrepreneur, and I really value this community. I&#x27;m very much looking forward to hearing your reactions, feedback, and questions, and to hearing your experiences in this space, which is so intimate and important to so many of us.<p>EDIT: We are operational across the United States, and are actively working on international expansion to Canada, Europe (via Geneva &amp; London), and the Middle East (via Dubai).","time":1594825477,"title":"Launch HN: Legacy (YC S19) – we help men test and freeze their sperm","type":"story"},{"by":"djsumdog","descendants":91,"id":23846103,"kids":[23846689,23847710,23849223,23849130,23846649,23853839,23850796,23849262,23849708,23849956,23846678],"score":311,"time":1594825167,"title":"Google is facing a lawsuit for tracking people even when they opt out","type":"story","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/google-lawsuit-app-tracking-without-permission-reuters-2020-7"},{"by":"realpanzer","descendants":104,"id":23846026,"kids":[23846641,23846694,23847965,23846431,23846513,23846909,23848207,23847774,23846350,23849224,23848248,23848780,23848149,23849095,23850342],"score":182,"time":1594824912,"title":"Ubuntu Will No Longer Track Which Packages Users Install","type":"story","url":"https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2020/07/ubuntu-popularity-contest-removed"},{"by":"tosh","descendants":17,"id":23845580,"kids":[23846034,23846059,23847409,23846488,23846562,23845788,23849729],"score":42,"time":1594822972,"title":"Viaweb FAQ (2004)","type":"story","url":"http://www.paulgraham.com/vwfaq.html"},{"by":"jayliew","descendants":87,"id":23845575,"kids":[23847126,23847261,23846918,23846261,23846662,23847530,23846339,23846907,23846545,23846321,23846074,23855929,23848308,23846511,23848536,23849089,23847113,23848543,23847329,23849991,23846962,23847911,23846113,23845971],"score":452,"time":1594822938,"title":"Deep Work and the 30-Hour Method for Learning a New Skill (2018)","type":"story","url":"https://azeria-labs.com/the-importance-of-deep-work-the-30-hour-method-for-learning-a-new-skill/"},{"by":"razin","descendants":910,"id":23845579,"kids":[23846112,23848213,23845859,23845658,23847403,23846569,23846302,23845665,23846660,23846258,23846631,23846476,23848386,23846069,23851714,23845899,23847212,23846035,23845981,23848431,23848080,23850832,23845678,23846018,23846312,23845817,23845761,23847615,23849322,23845949,23846565,23845808,23845826,23847970,23845947,23845950,23846953,23845927,23854105,23861943,23850726,23846060,23846240,23845926,23846415,23847354,23860656,23847823,23849328,23846139,23849654,23845833,23846027,23849743,23848846,23846147,23849850,23853610,23850121,23847251,23846132,23849298,23847874,23846296,23846708,23845891,23845861,23846460,23846185,23855809,23850709,23845850,23847771,23848058,23847825,23846432,23848236,23845876,23846477,23846723,23847599,23848156,23845824,23846724,23851019,23846739,23848100,23845720,23848934,23847480,23847711,23845784,23850639,23847589],"score":610,"time":1594822963,"title":"Orthodox Privilege","type":"story","url":"http://paulgraham.com/orth.html"},{"by":"eggspurt","dead":true,"id":23845438,"kids":[23845770,23845904],"score":11,"time":1594822243,"title":"Body of tech entrepreneur, 33, is found decapitated in his Manhattan apartment","type":"story","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8524023/Decapitated-dismembered-body-man-34-luxury-Manhattan-apartment-block.html"},{"by":"coldcode","descendants":2,"id":23845434,"kids":[23845602,23845507],"score":2,"text":"Search for &quot;swiftui combine image download&quot; limited to the past 24 hrs.

perspective, what is it about Windows 10 that allows applications to bring the entire system to its knees???<p>It seems to me that if a process is misbehaving, it is a problem for that process alone, not for other processes and especially not for the host operating system.<p>Yet time and time again Windows 10 is vulnerable to episodes of unresponsiveness, even to the point of having to resort to a power cycle.<p>Today I opened Edge and Firefox, along with Visual Studio (not doing anything). I also had a VirtualBox VM was running Ubuntu. Its only activity was a terminal session running top.<p>The browsers had 5 or 6 open tabs. Most tabs were static pages just sitting there. From Edge I had a video stream playing and was attempting a screen recording using a browser extension.<p>Left for 5 minutes after which I could barely get a response from any app or Windows. Video stream was hung. Mouse would move but if I clicked on a tab or app nothing happened. Ctrl-Alt-Del did nothing. Click on upper right &#x27;X&#x27; on any application did nothing. Right click an application group in the task bar and select &#x27;Close all windows&#x27; did nothing. Right-clicking an empty spot of the task bar did not launch a pop-up menu.<p>Alt-Tab worked, sort of. It would show its list of windows. But releasing Alt-Tab for any window did not switch to that window.<p>Technically, what is it about Windows that allows applications to bring the entire system to its knees???<p>It is a question I&#x27;ve asked for as long as I&#x27;ve used Windows (Dabbled with Windows 1.x and 2.x, became regular user with Win 3.1)<p>Tho&#x27; Windows&#x27; reliability improved over the decades, it continues to be vulnerable to apps, services and drivers that veer off into the weeds.","time":1594778094,"title":"Ask HN: How can Windows be so easily brought to its knees by apps, drivers, etc?","type":"story"},{"by":"hardmaru","descendants":12,"id":23840295,"kids":[23857873,23856841,23856855,23859542,23857039,23858069],"score":69,"time":1594777464,"title":"The Game of Life – Emergence in Generative Art","type":"story","url":"https://www.artnome.com/news/2020/7/12/the-game-of-life-emergence-in-generative-art"},{"by":"caminmccluskey","descendants":19,"id":23840267,"kids":[23840404,23863257,23858922,23850504,23859872,23841477,23840330,23841162,23842953,23841245,23857152],"score":10,"text":"The general sentiment of discourse on Twitter seems to be at an all time low.

Furthermore, what changes could be made to make the platform more open to civilised debate across a range of (potentially sensitive) topics?<p>I realise that hate is good for engagement, ideally any changes they made wouldn&#x27;t affect this (else they wouldn&#x27;t make them).

I&#x27;m Lior, one of the makers of Openbase (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openbase.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openbase.io</a>). We help developers choose the right JS package for any task - through user reviews and insights about packages&#x27; popularity, reliability, activity and more.<p>I have started Openbase out of my own frustration as a developer: there are 1.3 million JavaScript packages out there, and I found myself spending an increasing amount of time researching and evaluating packages every time I wanted to accomplish a task - displaying an autocomplete, sending an HTTP request, extracting significant keywords from an page, etc. Each time I would make that research, I spent hours reading different blogposts comparing those packages, going over PRs and commit messages to see how active the development or maintainers are, and trying to cross-reference data from npm and GitHub to get to a decision.<p>We started by gathering data from npm and GitHub - from versions and dependencies, to commits, pull requests, maintainers and tried to figure out what insights we could surface that could help us (and fellow developers) choose the right package. We ended up adding automated insights like star count over time, commit frequency, time between major&#x2F;minor versions, average time to resolve issues and PRs, percent of commits by the community, dependency insights, and more. Here&#x27;s what the insights page looks like: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openbase.io&#x2F;js&#x2F;react\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openbase.io&#x2F;js&#x2F;react</a><p>We decided not to stop there, and allow our users to discover the best packages for performing each task and compare them side-by-side. We&#x27;ve already manually curated several hundreds categories, such as CSS frameworks, OAuth packages, and HTTP request libraries: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openbase.io&#x2F;packages&#x2F;best-javascript-css-framework-libraries\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openbase.io&#x2F;packages&#x2F;best-javascript-css-framework-l...</a>\nOn the long term, we want to build tools that will allow the community to curate and maintain categories, and get to thousands of categories for any imaginable task.<p>Lastly, over the past couple of weeks we decided to try something more ambitious - we want to let developers rate and review open-source packages. While data and metrics are great, we found ourselves often consulting with friends and colleagues about which package to use. We think reviews could reveal a lot of insights that cannot be deduced by looking at metrics alone. To throw in even more fun to the mix, we added badges like &quot;Great documentation&quot;, &quot;Performant&quot;, and &quot;Hard to use&quot; (check it out: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openbase.io&#x2F;js&#x2F;vue\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openbase.io&#x2F;js&#x2F;vue</a>), and are looking for ideas for more badges.<p>We found that many maintainers want to promote their packages, and unfortunately, there aren&#x27;t good ways of doing so today. This is a problem for new package maintainers who are having a hard time getting those first thousand users, an API&#x2F;SaaS company that wants to earn developers&#x27; mindshare, or a software firm that wants to showcase their expertise.\nWe&#x27;ve started by allowing package maintainers to claim their package page, and giving them the tools to promote it for free.\nIn the future, we want to allow for paid promotion of packages - limiting it to a single, clearly-marked promoted package for each category. We would just surface the promoted package, but the package ratings, reviews, insights, and metrics are obviously untouched. We believe this kind of balanced approach could make Openbase a sustainable company, while not impairing the user experience.<p>In the good ol&#x27; 90s, when I made my first steps with JavaScript, and it was all about small scripts to make web pages a bit more interactive. I can&#x27;t believe two decades later, the JavaScript ecosystem has gotten so huge and complicated, that we&#x27;ve actually built a startup to help you navigate this mess.

As ambitious as their ideas were, it didn&#x27;t take off because it was trying to do too many things to too many people.<p>The idea for Communick is simple: instead of trying to recreate everything from scratch, just take <i>every best-in-class service in the messaging and social media space and make it as worry-free as possible for everyone to use.</i><p>At first, we are hosting:<p><pre><code>   - Matrix\n   - XMPP\n   - Mastodon\n</code></pre>\nOne of the things that we are doing differently as a way to break the chicken-and-egg problem is to offer <i>group \n packages</i>. You (the privacy freak) can buy a group package of 10 accounts and then invite friends. For those that value their privacy and understand TINSTAAFL, it&#x27;s a small price (really, our introductory price is less than $0.15&#x2F;user&#x2F;month!)<p>Focus on privacy is so big, a lot of the late work was to make it easy to accept crypto. Ethereum and ERC20 tokens like Brave&#x27;s BAT or DAI. Email addresses are not required for signing-up. I am hosting the servers in Germany, no user\ndata stored in the US. I am also only supporting messaging services where end-to-end encryption is easy to be adopted\nby anyone. I also put together a discourse instance at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.communick.com to provide help and hopefully \n create more documentation and guides to help non-technical people to adopt these services.<p>It would be great if you could take a look, join and let me know your\nthoughts and feedback to make this better and more useful.<p>Thanks!","time":1594691264,"title":"Show HN: Communick.

I am a DevOps enginer with lots of experience with many technologies.  During the month of April i got a few companies reaching out during the pandemic and i was lucky to get a job with a company looking for an SRE, from the outside the company needed someone with my skills and the team was nice and I thought this would be a good fit for me so I took the job.<p>A month into the job i see the company really does not have good best practices for development, I have no access to dev environments or QA to test anything.  It took 2 weeks for me to just get admin access on a Windows computer. They are a finance company and they don&#x27;t even understand why I need virtualbox on my machine.  There have been 3 outtages on a new service that was rolled out recently and i can see why. There is no communication between ops and devs and there are no best practices.   The people are NICE but also they are not really looking to suddenly change their process because they involve security and change control and that&#x27;s something they are not changing right away.<p>I interviewed with another company that is full AWS and i would basically take ownership of their existing environment from configuring aws resources, ci cd pipelines and working with monitoring and load testing. stuff that I now how to do and do well.   I feel my current job is basically being a linux admin and paid very well for it but really they are not using my skills and even if i want to do my job there are blockers on my way.<p>I want to be honest and just thank them for the job and resign and let them now i don&#x27;t feel well getting paid so much money when they are not maximizing my skills .

I dont really care. I&#x27;m posting mostly because I&#x27;m curious if anyone else notices the same thing.<p>HN has generally had great content. I have read some fascinating articles, had great discussion and learned a lot, but it feels like its just gone downhill. Nowadays the front page always has at least one, if not many political, or tangentially political articles. Generally, politics are off topic on HN, but the ways the rules are written, they can technically be loosely considered on topic, especially in the current climate.<p>Some of these submissions may be very interesting, but the quality of discussion on these threads is trash. I have yet to see one that doesnt violate <i>at least</i> half of the guidelines. They&#x27;re ripe with bad faith arguing, strawmanning, ad hominem, and all sorts of other arguments.  In fact looking back, of the comment guidelines, the only ones I don&#x27;t see regularly violated are the one about broken site features or reddit. It seems common now for day old accounts to post a bunch of &quot;hot takes&quot; and dip. I see more flagging on comments that dont break rules than I do on legitimate trolls and antagonizers, who now seem to be lauded as free-thinkers and victims of censorship. Even worse, a lot of this this manages to seep into the better, not political threads. I do think the moderators do a decent job of stomping out threads that get out of control, but it&#x27;s a large site and I assume its difficult to keep up.<p>As it stands, it seems HN, much like other social sites, is something I should eschew for my own mental health. So I probably wont be visiting this site anymore. I might return again eventually, as I&#x27;ve left the site once before. I&#x27;m not a famous user or anything, so I dont expect this to mean anything to anyone, but I suppose if it gets any traction before fading off or getting flagged. I can hear from other people as to of they agree, disagree, or if I&#x27;m just an idiot.","time":1594678092,"title":"Tell HN: I'm Leaving HN","type":"story"},{"by":"rtsil","descendants":129,"id":23826176,"kids":[23827286,23830948,23830030,23832670,23830566,23829870,23833861,23839240,23829541,23833307,23834117,23830362,23837734,23834957,23837148,23829754,23830442,23837055,23830605,23830623,23830216,23826375,23829566],"score":211,"time":1594678573,"title":"Andean condor can fly for 100 miles without flapping wings","type":"story","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/13/andean-condor-fly-without-flapping-wings-flight-bird"},{"by":"brettgoldstein3","descendants":88,"id":23826075,"kids":[23831353,23831261,23831506,23831161,23831702,23831128,23831936,23831545,23831592,23831269,23836586,23831178,23831585,23831330,23831937,23831434,23831266,23831647,23831910,23831794,23831674],"score":47,"time":1594677760,"title":"The unbundling of Harvard has begun","type":"story","url":"https://socialstudies.substack.com/p/-the-unbundling-of-harvard-has-begun"},{"by":"dewey","descendants":454,"id":23826070,"kids":[23826526,23826586,23826268,23829211,23826432,23826816,23830742,23829482,23828755,23830098,23826472,23826254,23826495,23826746,23826606,23831335,23826210,23826259,23829162,23826408,23826256,23830290,23832336,23833056,23826232,23826419,23829832,23830886,23826738,23826501,23826545,23827043,23832295,23830213,23830836,23826987,23828999,23826536,23829262,23826794,23826164,23826344,23829025,23827580,23830190,23828947,23828487,23832031,23827078,23826136,23826573,23826399,23826201,23826323,23826473,23827051,23828819,23826341,23826451,23832393,23830934,23830049,23827775,23827128,23830439,23828877,23826265,23826523,23828768,23826562,23829973,23826490,23827763,23829982,23826405,23826244,23829966,23826401,23826740,23826260,23826953,23827380,23828880,23829646,23827044,23826535,23826462,23832508,23826095,23826430,23826518,23826468,23826592,23831911,23826414,23827909,23826818,23828761,23829954,23832640,23830927,23830944,23826517,23827612,23832071,23827350],"score":501,"time":1594677745,"title":"The AirPods Pro “Rattlegate”","type":"story","url":"https://annoying.technology/posts/abea6876cf4f2e13/"},{"by":"hyperluz","descendants":108,"id":23825979,"kids":[23830590,23830776,23830388,23830099,23829917,23830154,23830522,23833097,23834493,23829794,23829933,23840678,23829737,23830734,23834723,23830067,23830754,23834713,23830164,23835910,23835482,23830319,23830179,23829950],"score":133,"time":1594677115,"title":"The Greatest Teaching Techniques Don't Compute over Zoom","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-07-12/the-greatest-teaching-techniques-don-t-compute-over-zoom"},{"by":"aaronchall","descendants":137,"id":23825931,"kids":[23826828,23826565,23826806,23830158,23826849,23826416,23826679,23826249,23829468,23826394,23830456,23826319,23826842,23827220,23827055,23829637,23826513,23826598,23826231,23827115,23826916,23826745,23828523,23826286,23831072,23826625,23826516],"score":146,"time":1594676825,"title":"Laziness Impatience Hubris","type":"story","url":"http://wiki.c2.com/?LazinessImpatienceHubris"},{"by":"linux2647","descendants":97,"id":23825937,"kids":[23830617,23835934,23831006,23830292,23836955,23830758,23836225,23830447,23835521,23830899,23835919,23835898,23838205,23830718,23832818,23830340],"score":95,"time":1594676863,"title":"Head asleep, body awake","type":"story","url":"https://alvinalexander.com/misc/head-awake-body-asleep-hear-myself-snoring/"},{"by":"finphil","descendants":4,"id":23825850,"kids":[23826187,23826135,23826097],"score":4,"time":1594676265,"title":"Robinhood raises $320M more, bringing latest round to $600M at $8.6B valuation","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/robinhood-raises-320m-more-bringing-its-latest-round-to-600m-at-an-8-6b-valuation/"},{"by":"bryanbraun","descendants":47,"id":23825798,"kids":[23827114,23826301,23826093,23827753,23826160,23829677,23826887,23831933,23826119,23826392,23826300,23826115,23829955,23827566],"score":122,"time":1594675866,"title":"Skypack – A new kind of JavaScript delivery network","type":"story","url":"https://www.skypack.dev"},{"by":"dstuecken","descendants":8,"id":23825788,"kids":[23825898,23825934,23832217,23826485],"score":3,"time":1594675806,"title":"Show HN: Firewards – Tool to build a friend referral program for your newsletter","type":"story","url":"https://www.firewards.com"},{"by":"tomcam","descendants":4,"id":23825780,"kids":[23826067,23825829],"score":2,"text":"Am writing Yet Another Static Site Generator.

There is one person who is the &quot;qa-lead&quot;. But I feel they only use the title as a way to pass off all the work to myself and the other team member.

I write, read, design, develop, and peruse the usual sites all in a browser.<p>I started to get overwhelmed with all of the things I was working on and even just the daily chaos that was using a web browser for everything.

General &quot;project management&quot; and productivity apps weren&#x27;t working, I was still facing the same problems just with another app in my tool case.<p>So, I started building Partizion. The main methodology that productive people employ (and is the foundation on which Partizion was designed) is that multitasking is 1. impossible and 2. less efficient.<p>The more you &quot;partition&quot; (see where I got the name from?) your work, and focus on the task at hand, the more efficient and productive you can be. You&#x27;ll finish tasks faster, you&#x27;ll stay on track to complete your daily checklist, and you&#x27;ll be able to pickup where you left off or switch contexts much more easily.<p>I built this methodology right into Partizion. You can separate your work, create groups of tabs for projects&#x2F;tasks&#x2F;daily habits and open them with one click. Partizion is still in its early stages but I have committed to developing Partizion into the tool that should have come standard with every web browser.<p>If you have some free time, I&#x27;d love for you to check it out and let me know your thoughts.

everyone! I’m Peter from Aquarium (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aquariumlearning.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aquariumlearning.com&#x2F;</a>). We help deep learning developers find problems in their datasets and models, then help fix them by smartly curating their datasets. We want to build the same high-power tooling for data curation that sophisticated ML companies like Cruise, Waymo, and Tesla have and bring it to the masses.<p>ML models are defined by a combination of code and the data that the code trains on. A programmer must think hard about what behavior they want from their model, assemble a dataset of labeled examples of what they want their model to do, and then train their model on that dataset. As they encounter errors in production, they must collect and label data for the model to train on to fix these errors, and verify they&#x27;re fixed by monitoring the model’s performance on a test set with previous failure cases. See Andrej Karpathy’s Software 2.0 article (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@karpathy&#x2F;software-2-0-a64152b37c35\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@karpathy&#x2F;software-2-0-a64152b37c35</a>) for a great description of this workflow.<p>My cofounder Quinn and I were early engineers at Cruise Automation (YC W14), where we built the perception stack + ML infrastructure for self driving cars. Quinn was tech lead of the ML infrastructure team and I was tech lead for the Perception team. We frequently ran into problems with our dataset that we needed to fix, and we found that most model improvement came from improvement to a dataset’s variety and quality. Basically, ML models are only as good as the datasets they’re trained on.<p>ML datasets need variety so the model can train on the types of data that it will see in production environments. In one case, a safety driver noticed that our car was not detecting green construction cones. Why? When we looked into our dataset, it turned out that almost all of the cones we had labeled were orange. Our model had not seen many examples of green cones at training time, so it was performing quite badly on this object in production. We found and labeled more green cones into our training dataset, retrained the model, and it detected green cones just fine.<p>ML datasets need clean and consistent data so the model does not learn the wrong behavior. In another case, we retrained our model on a new batch of data that came from our labelers and it was performing much worse on detecting “slow signs” in our test dataset. After days of careful investigation, we realized it was due to a change to our labeling process that caused our labelers to label many “speed limit signs” as “slow signs,” which was confusing the model and causing it to perform badly on detecting “slow signs.” We fixed our labeling process, did an additional QA pass over our dataset to fix the bad labels, retrained our model on the clean data, and the problems went away.<p>While there’s a lot of tooling out there to debug and improve code, there’s not a lot of tooling to debug and improve datasets. As a result, it’s extremely painful to identify issues with variety and quality and appropriately modify datasets to fix them. ML engineers often encounter scenarios like:<p>Your model’s accuracy measured on the test set is at 80%. You abstractly understand that the model is failing on the remaining 20% and you have no idea why.<p>Your model does great on your test set but performs disastrously when you deploy it to production and you have no idea why.<p>You retrain your model on some new data that came in, it’s worse, and you have no idea why.<p>ML teams want to understand what’s in their datasets, find problems in their dataset and model performance, and then edit &#x2F; sample data to fix these problems. Most teams end up building their own one-off tooling in-house that isn’t very good. This tooling typically relies on naive methods of data curation that are really manual and involve “eyeballing” many examples in your dataset to discover labeling errors &#x2F; failure patterns. This works well for small datasets but starts to fail as your dataset size grows above a few thousand examples.<p>Aquarium’s technology relies on letting your trained ML model do the work of guiding what parts of the dataset to pay attention to. Users can get started by submitting their labels and corresponding model predictions through our API. Then Aquarium lets users drill into their model performance - for example, visualize all examples where we confused a labeled car for a pedestrian from this date range - so users can understand the different failure modes of a model. Aquarium also finds examples where your model has the highest loss &#x2F; disagreement with your labeled dataset, which tends to surface many labeling errors (ie, the model is right and the label is wrong!).<p>Users can also provide their model&#x27;s embeddings for each entry, which are an anonymized representation of what their model “thought” about the data. The neural network embeddings for a datapoint (generated by either our users’ neural networks or by our stable of pretrained nets) encode the input data into a relatively short vector of floats. We can then identify outliers and group together examples in a dataset by analyzing the distances between these embeddings. We also provide a nice thousand-foot-view visualization of embeddings that allows users to zoom into interesting parts of their dataset. (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;DHABgXXe-Fs?t=139\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;DHABgXXe-Fs?t=139</a>)<p>Since embeddings can be extracted from most neural networks, this makes our platform very general. We have successfully analyzed dataset + models operating on images, 3D point clouds from depth sensors, and audio.<p>After finding problems, Aquarium helps users solve them by editing or adding data. After finding bad data, Aquarium integrates into our users’ labeling platforms to automatically correct labeling errors. After finding patterns of model failures, Aquarium samples similar examples from users’ unlabeled datasets (green cones) and sends those to labeling.<p>Think about this as a platform for interactive learning. By focusing on the most “important” areas of the dataset that the model is consistently getting wrong, we increase the leverage of ML teams to sift through massive datasets and decide on the proper corrective action to improve their model performance.<p>Our goal is to build tools to reduce or eliminate the need for ML engineers to handhold the process of improving model performance through data curation - basically, Andrej Karpathy’s Operation Vacation concept (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;g2R2T631x7k?t=820\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;g2R2T631x7k?t=820</a>) as a service.<p>If any of those experiences speak to you, we’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback.

Likewise with providing a GUI to allow the user to then send that public key to any website that the user wanted to create a login for.<p>From a security point of view, it would also seem to be a no-brainer.  The key uploaded to the website is the public key, so any security breach on that website would only net the hackers a load of public keys which are openly available anyway.<p>This kind of login would do away with the need to remember any passwords at all [not even a master password for a password manager] and would also seem to mitigate the danger of people using the same password on various sites.  It wouldn&#x27;t matter if someone used the same public key on various sites, as it&#x27;s not meant to be a secret anyway.<p>I&#x27;m not a security expert. So no doubt I&#x27;m missing some really obvious downside here --the only one I can think of is that we&#x27;d need a different &#x27;login&#x27; for each device you use, which would somehow need to be linked together into the same user account on any website-- but, apart from that I can&#x27;t see why SSH logins are not more widely used.<p>So, come on you smart HN-ers. What glaringly obvious gotcha have I overlooked?<p>[0] The only site I can think of that allows me to login with my SSH public key is Github.

I&#x27;m looking for advice and OSS solutions that would simplify and give more of a &quot;semi-managed&quot; feel, to help us deploy our own HA stack somewhere like Hetzner.","time":1594487436,"title":"Ask HN: Moving from Cloud to

was using the HN front page to test a library I was writing when I noticed some links that probably should be HTTPS are in plain HTTP. This piqued my interest a bit so I did a little analysis on how prevalent plain HTTP links are on HN. I probably don&#x27;t need to rehash the harm of using plain HTTP, even for personal blogs -- they can be snooped, and they can be modified to inject either ads or more sinister payloads. In fact, years ago I once disabled my ad blocker by accident and saw an ISP-injected ad on my personal site; never again, I swore.<p>The methodology is simple. I gathered all links from https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;front (&quot;past&quot; on the navigation bar) for each day from 2020-01-01 to 2020-07-09. These are the top stories of each day. This is a trivial task and resulted in 17566 links (raw data [0][1][2]). There are &lt;100 duplicates, which I kept. Among these are 1112 plain HTTP links, amounting to ~6.3% out of 17566.<p>Next I analyzed how many of the 1112 plain HTTP links are available over HTTPS. Methodology:<p>1. Check if the HTTP version redirects to the HTTPS version; if so, done, otherwise record the HTTP response;<p>2. Replace http:&#x2F;&#x2F; with https:&#x2F;&#x2F; and see if the HTTPS URL works; if so, record the HTTPS response;<p>3. Compare the HTTP and HTTPS responses. If they&#x27;re identical, done. If not, compare the length of the responses; if they differ by &lt;=1%, record this as HTTPS response almost identical as HTTP, and assume the HTTPS version works (the page may not use relative URLs or omit the protocol, so the HTTPS response may be subtly different while having the exact same rendered output).<p>The analysis script is available at [3].<p>---<p>To be continued in a comment since I&#x27;m hitting the 2000 char limit: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23802522","time":1594478497,"title":"Tell HN: 6.3% of HN top submissions in plain HTTP, more than half upgradable","type":"story"},{"by":"jasonhansel","descendants":4,"id":23802512,"kids":[23803055,23803084],"score":12,"time":1594478356,"title":"A More Specific Letter on Justice and Open Debate","type":"story","url":"https://theobjective.substack.com/p/a-more-specific-letter-on-justice"},{"by":"kumarski","descendants":5,"id":23802439,"kids":[23808980,23808526],"score":4,"text":"It was a blog that they published on hackernews it was sometime in the past 60 days where they published everything they&#x27;ve purchased in daily expenses.","time":1594477753,"title":"Ask HN: Someone published an app that publishes their expenses","type":"story"},{"by":"tomaszs","descendants":3,"id":23802414,"kids":[23802728,23807335,23803422],"score":3,"time":1594477451,"title":"Ask HN: What is easier to read: camel or snake case?","type":"story"},{"by":"finphil","descendants":85,"id":23802403,"kids":[23802916,23806555,23802822,23802958,23802974,23808321,23802963,23803685,23806449,23810677,23806827,23807978,23806149,23807054,23809497,23806944,23805856,23809367,23804416,23803427],"score":73,"time":1594477377,"title":"The world is drinking less coffee while office workers stay home","type":"story","url":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/economy/the-world-is-drinking-less-coffee-while-office-workers-stay-home/ar-BB16BZzj"},{"by":"swyx","descendants":11,"id":23802349,"kids":[23810753,23810846,23811015,23809539,23810822],"score":33,"time":1594476819,"title":"Epigrams on Programming (1982)","type":"story","url":"http://pu.inf.uni-tuebingen.de/users/klaeren/epigrams.html"},{"by":"jlpcsl","descendants":60,"id":23802322,"kids":[23803956,23803760,23803818,23803817,23803559,23804533,23803860,23803583,23804081],"score":43,"time":1594476545,"title":"Big Tech marshals a right-leaning army of allies for antitrust fight","type":"story","url":"https://www.axios.com/big-tech-marshals-a-right-leaning-army-of-allies-for-antitrust-fight-155d5760-86d4-4ce0-9cda-734dbc95e252.html"},{"by":"samcrawford","descendants":128,"id":23802317,"kids":[23802323,23804405,23804047,23805023,23804217,23804606,23806525,23804814,23813708,23804863,23810588,23805658,23805231,23807146,23809388,23806965,23804605,23815937,23808247,23809181,23814005,23806416,23823182,23813363,23805265,23806720,23810451,23811255,23806910,23806102,23809419,23803167,23808446,23805101,23804556,23812241,23815471,23806401,23807475,23807878,23805070],"score":402,"time":1594476534,"title":"Show HN: Trail Router – generate running routes that prefer greenery and nature","type":"story","url":"https://trailrouter.com/"},{"by":"spking","descendants":75,"id":23802279,"kids":[23807175,23807223,23804173,23808892,23812432,23813559,23808427,23808491,23808418,23807471,23804951],"score":195,"time":1594476161,"title":"The battle to outlaw end-to-end encryption in the U.S. is heating up","type":"story","url":"https://www.expressvpn.com/blog/the-battle-to-outlaw-end-to-end-encryption-is-heating-up"},{"by":"unexaminedlife","descendants":8,"id":23802272,"kids":[23802380,23803237,23803215,23803261,23802398,23802417,23802480],"score":2,"text":"Today&#x27;s politics in US is overwhelmingly polarized.

Wikipedia is great, but it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of leveraging the rich variety of learning resources that exist on the Web. Same applies to GoodReads - which is focused only on books, whereas these days we actually learn from videos, articles, MOOCs, tweetstorms, slack&#x2F;discord groups, podcasts, livestreams, newsletters, online conferences, apps &amp; games, interactive explorables and much more.<p>For now, I am building it as a social network for lifelong learners. It&#x27;s open-source, built with Rails + PostgreSQL, and complies with standards like Dublin Core&#x27;s LRMI extension of schema.org and ActivityPub for integration with Fediverse. A GraphQL API is also available if others want to build alternative clients.<p>I have made decent progress so far: Imported thousands of courses and book summaries, built a browser extension for quick lookup&#x2F;addition to the repository, a spaced-repetition based flashcard practice module. Users can even discover learning resources by recommendations ELSEWHERE (for eg: &quot;Show me books on History which are highly recommended by venture capitalists&quot;)<p>I originally started building this as something to help with my daughters&#x27; and my own learning.

It’s a savings account where people get chances to win monthly prizes through a random chance raffle. The more you save, the more entries you get. Premium Bonds are popular because many people prefer the chance to win a life-changing amount of money rather than a small interest payment from a bank. As a result, the program has been successful: over 23M people save through Premium Bonds (33% of the population) with over $100B deposited.<p>Human nature makes it difficult to adopt habits we know are healthy in the long-run but painful in the short run. The idea behind prize-linked savings is to use psychology to make saving exciting in the short run so that people will get the long run benefit. Even if you don’t win a prize, at least you still have access to your savings. You can’t lose anything other than the opportunity cost of interest at another bank.<p>In the U.S, people also like the chance to win a life-changing amount of money. This is what drives much of the $80 billion ($640 per household) spent on the lottery every year despite it being a hugely negative expected value proposition. Prize-linked savings was illegal in the U.S until 2015 when the American Savings Promotion Act was passed based on evidence showing prize-linked savings programs help people save more, especially in financially vulnerable populations.<p>We started building this 9 months ago. Ben and I are both former finance people turned tech people. As personal finance and behavioral psychology nerds (Nudge, Thinking Fast and Slow, etc.), we were excited by the idea of building a product that could help people, but that also had big business potential.<p>The market for consumer deposits in the U.S is huge. We make money by earning interest from our partner bank. We view our savings product as an entry point into the banking market, with the potential to offer a variety of revenue generating services to our users as other neo-banks have done. We plan to differentiate ourselves from\nother neo-banks by always offering products that make use of behavioral psychology to nudge people toward healthier financial habits.<p>With our app, you save money in an FDIC insured account. For every $25 you save, you get a recurring ticket into weekly random number drawings with chances to win prizes ranging from $0.10 to the $10 million jackpot. We provide a rate of return on savings that on average is in-line with the top yielding savings accounts out there like Marcus or Ally. You might get a higher return if you’re lucky and win more prizes than expected. You might get a lower return if you win fewer prizes than expected. Even in a worst case scenario where you never win a prize, you still have your savings.<p>Yotta is free. The $10 million jackpot would be paid out by our insurance partner. We are funding a jackpot via insurance to solve the chicken and egg problem of offering a life-changing jackpot that we hope will motivate people, even if the odds are extremely low that you’ll win it.<p>Hope you guys check it out. Happy to answer any questions, and looking forward to any feedback.","time":1594302150,"title":"Launch HN: Yotta Savings (YC S20) – Behavioral psychology to help people save","type":"story"},{"by":"gklitt","descendants":59,"id":23779894,"kids":[23781926,23780273,23782439,23785239,23783128,23780354,23784792,23876799,23784496,23783123,23780048],"score":95,"time":1594301201,"title":"A Tour of Acme (2012)","type":"story","url":"https://research.swtch.com/acme"},{"by":"atreadw","descendants":7,"id":23779778,"kids":[23780042,23780266,23781712,23781740],"score":8,"time":1594300378,"title":"The for/Else Statement in Python","type":"story","url":"http://theautomatic.net/2020/07/09/the-for-else-statement-in-python/"},{"by":"rbanffy","descendants":12,"id":23779710,"kids":[23779846,23780026,23780287,23781557],"score":21,"time":1594299758,"title":"U.S. military is a bigger polluter than more than 100 countries combined (2019)","type":"story","url":"https://qz.com/1655268/"},{"by":"DarkContinent","descendants":6,"id":23779691,"kids":[23783241,23785182,23779870],"score":12,"time":1594299614,"title":"I Cited Their Study, So They Disavowed It","type":"story","url":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/i-cited-their-study-so-they-disavowed-it-11594250254"},{"by":"tosh","descendants":31,"id":23779659,"kids":[23779999,23779910,23780183,23839461,23781227,23780559,23780379,23781043,23780014,23780462],"score":98,"time":1594299384,"title":"Rust Playground","type":"story","url":"https://play.rust-lang.org/"},{"by":"23throwaway23","descendants":27,"id":23779621,"kids":[23779775,23781238,23781005,23781611,23780343,23780894],"score":30,"time":1594299101,"title":"Global temperatures likely to hit at least 1C warming for next five years","type":"story","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/09/global-temperatures-likely-to-hit-at-least-1c-warming-for-next-five-years"},{"by":"jsmoov","descendants":26,"id":23779616,"kids":[23780124,23781659,23780077,23780655,23780237,23780164,23779935,23780419,23780409,23780391,23780398,23780400,23780403,23780385,23780415,23780416,23780418,23780422,23780423,23780425,23780406,23780394,23780388,23780135],"score":44,"time":1594299064,"title":"How to launch when the app directory rejects you","type":"story","url":"https://directmemo.io/blog/how-to-launch-when-the-app-store-rejects-you?ref=HackerNews"},{"by":"Shivetya","descendants":551,"id":23779420,"kids":[23780144,23780310,23780444,23780041,23780851,23780414,23785554,23780460,23779801,23781591,23779958,23780482,23780184,23780370,23780329,23782739,23780796,23787822,23784808,23781681,23780080,23781830,23781581,23781572,23815308,23787070,23784982,23784552,23786983,23780279,23782379,23784852,23782450,23782732,23779893,23787773,23781189,23780019,23783132,23783922,23780746,23785971,23784080,23784611,23779885,23787788,23779873,23786781,23784345,23782008,23780476,23786938,23779982,23780921,23781166],"score":502,"time":1594297592,"title":"Portland approves 10% cap on fees that food delivery apps can charge restaurants","type":"story","url":"https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2020/07/portland-approves-10-cap-on-fees-that-food-delivery-apps-can-charge-restaurants.html"},{"by":"yarapavan","descendants":18,"id":23779396,"kids":[23780205,23779830,23795974,23790980,23780395,23791774,23779682],"score":77,"time":1594297425,"title":"The Rise of the Solo Capitalists","type":"story","url":"https://nbt.substack.com/p/the-rise-of-the-solo-capitalists"},{"by":"elorant","descendants":3,"id":23779262,"kids":[23779508,23779905],"score":6,"time":1594296290,"title":"Writing ten articles a week for the last three years","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/better-marketing/13-things-i-learned-about-writing-10-articles-a-week-for-the-last-3-years-e3d532b59396"},{"by":"thunderbong","descendants":80,"id":23779222,"kids":[23779858,23780428,23779694,23779559,23781124,23779627,23779797,23780216,23780410,23785621,23781563,23780009,23782723,23785990,23782198,23780373,23779820,23781824,23786101,23783080,23780515,23779683,23780570,23780441],"score":222,"time":1594295991,"title":"Decentraleyes – Local CDN Emulation","type":"story","url":"https://decentraleyes.org"},{"by":"RickJWagner","descendants":19,"id":23779196,"kids":[23779838,23779720,23779889,23779644,23779652,23779703,23779842,23779626,23779940,23779909,23783097,23779522,23779637],"score":42,"time":1594295797,"title":"It Wasn’t My Cancelation That Bothered Me.

Why? Because the way it&#x27;s done now is a pain. Stakeholders, especially engineers, are required to spend unnecessary time manually finding underutilized or overly expensive EC2s. We believe the optimization process should be done automatically through a series of sophisticated algorithms. At the moment, there are over 70,000 AWS EC2 prices - doing that manually just won&#x27;t scale at most organizations.\nMy background is in software engineering.<p>Previous to founding Usage, I worked on high-performance computing research at JP Morgan Chase and as a software engineer at a number of smaller startups.<p>Here&#x27;s how it works: We are typically hired by the head of engineering. Usage makes its initial analysis of your organization&#x27;s AWS usage, then it&#x27;s passed to a human that manually verifies each recommendation for correctness. The human in the loop may reach out to if they are unsure about a particular recommendation.<p>We make money off of a monthly subscription to manage all of your organization&#x27;s AWS spend management. Our fee is based on your organization&#x27;s size and ranges from $2.5k-$10k&#x2F;month.

We are Sergey Yudovsky, Dmitry Karpov and Mike Rozhin, founders of ElectroNeek (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electroneek.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electroneek.com</a>), an automation platform for repetitive business tasks. The product we build let users design software ‘robots’ that imitate human actions in apps and websites, and deploy them to eliminate routine work. Our software also spots patterns of repetitive processes that users do in business app and suggests what to automate in the first place.<p>Some of you may have heard of a technology niche called Robotic Process Automation, or RPA. Basically, it’s about automating user actions on Graphic User Interface level, so no API is needed to automate any type of repetitive work on the computer. It has been known for 20+ years in the software testing space but emerged as a business process automation tool over the last decade, getting big momentum in Enterprise (95% of Fortune 500 use it for back-office task automations). If you know what Selenium is and how it automates work in browsers you may think of RPA that is a Selenium on steroids that can work in any desktop or SaaS app.<p>Basic RPA bots interact with app interfaces using mouse and keyboard, so if some repetitive process can be described by an instruction it can be automated (in theory) with RPA. There are a few fundamental issues with GUI-level automation (like, how should a programmed bot behave if the interface has changed?) but the major limit historically has been the complexity of RPA bot development and administration.<p>The biggest benefits of RPA come from automating complex tasks, sometimes even end-to-end jobs across multiple pieces of software and websites. As you might expect, this approach to automation works great until it doesn&#x27;t, and then someone has to step in with duct tape, a.k.a. write glue code to stick the pieces together, especially when it comes to variables, cycles and unstructured data (a lot of real business documents). RPA turned into something that business users can not use without having coding experience, which defeats the whole purpose.<p>In 2016-2018, Sergey and Dmitry, long time friends, separately got into RPA consulting business on two different continents. Sergey ran his own boutique firm that worked with big banks and natural resource companies in Eastern Europe and Dmitry was in charge of RPA branding and marketing strategy at EY’s Americas business. The idea to build new software in the space came from Sergey’s inbound marketing pipeline – many mid-market companies understood the benefits of RPA, attended Sergey’s firm demos of RPA bots in action, but walked away from implementations because they haven’t been able to afford them due to limited in-house IT resources and absence of a budget for consultants. ‘Too complex and expensive’ - the most common feedback of such potential clients who in fact were underserved by major vendors and integrators. To move forward with making RPA easier for such customers, Sergey and Dmitry brought in Mike, Dmitry’s college friend with a major in mathematics and career in cloud architecture.<p>We got some momentum among small banks, insurance companies and other companies with relatively tiny IT teams. But then we realized that there are obstacles with this market.  The biggest problem lies in finding what to automate in the first place. There is lots of manual repetition going on in companies that people just don&#x27;t notice. Managers and IT often understand the RPA tech and its capabilities, but struggle to find where to start.<p>An even bigger obstacle to automation is the need to learn complex tools and in fact, the need to code in order to automate significant routines. It turns out that navigating desktop or website interface requires more complex logic than taking data from SaaS A to SaaS B (the land of Zapier).<p>Over the time we adopted a mantra ‘if it can be done with a mouse only, without touching the keyboard, it should be automatable in this way&#x27;. At present, about 25% of our bot developers are non-IT. Typically their role in a company is related to working with analysis or operations data. They benefit from automating data extraction or data entry tasks and are motivated enough to learn a new tool to make their own life easier. These ‘Citizen Automator’s’ have a very simple decision-making process when they evaluate automation opportunities: will I get back the time I invest in designing a workflow? What are the time gains? If so, I invest my time and request a budget for a solution.<p>Our big insight about how to solve these obstacles came from the simple idea that ‘robots’ that execute automations also have all the capabilities to passively monitor how users interact with different interface elements, mouse, keyboard, etc. Why not let the ‘robot’ look at what you do in the first place, and attempt to find whether you run the same process repetitively, even if runs are spaced in time. Normally this could be seen as an invasion of privacy but, unlike with time trackers, the purpose of this monitoring is not a control of how people spend their working hours but the voluntarily search for automation possibilities for giving time back to people.<p>From that we built a simple repetitive-actions analytics tool that any users, regardless of IT experience, can use out of the box. Users across a company can download a client that passively monitors how they interact with different interface elements (forms, buttons) across whitelisted applications and websites, looks at clipboard frequency, mouse and keyboard usage patterns. On the back end, the cloud portion of the software identifies repetitive patterns and estimates potential (in hours) for automation on the level of software, users, and the organization.  For instance, if a user often switches between 2 application windows and uses Ctrl+C&#x2F;V in each iteration, this is a pattern of repetitive process that can be automated with RPA. The platform counts specific automation opportunities (like copy-pasting, repetitive click-throughs) to give a better sense on what exact routine it identified. These types of job\nare common for RPA automations. Even more common is the case of clicking through a legacy system to process a transaction (for instance, underwriting insurance) – users click on interface element on the same screens in the same orders for 30+ times and don’t even think of accelerating the clickthrough with automation. Or accounting case – many CPAs charge clients for manually uploading ledger account into cloud accounting software, taking data from excel to web forms. ‘Robots’ will ‘eat’ such tasks.<p>Once the repetitive patterns have been identified, it’s time to start automating. Designated users can build bots with no code&#x2F;low-code. Finding and eliminating inefficiencies is a pretty addictive process. When you have an automation tool in your hands you definitely look very differently at how your teams spend their working hours.<p>On the business side of the house, we adopted SaaS model and charge clients for the access to process discovery and automation suite that has both web and downloadable parts.<p>We eat our own dog food a lot: all of us, from sales and marketing to product, have our own set of automated workflows. In sales, we use bots to automate going to LinkedIn Sales Navigator to enrich contact lists, to check emails in these lists against spam databases (using tool named Scrapp) and then to build email sequences in Gmail, bypassing # of sent emails limit set by CRM vendor on our plan.  We&#x27;re really happy to get to this point and share our story here, thank you for reading about it!

I started programming in 1983 on a TRS-80 Model 3, then graduated to an Apple &#x2F;&#x2F;c, and fell into a Computer Science degree.  I&#x27;ve been a professional software developer since about 1996, with a couple of detours, including getting a business degree and doing project management.  I&#x27;m a good developer and have been successful in my work.<p>Nearly all of my professional development experience has been doing &quot;full stack&quot; web applications using a (much-evolved) Java backend with whatever passed for frontend at the time, starting with godawful applets, HTML, and Javascript in Netscape Navigator 3 and culminating in Vue.js and the madness that is Webpack.<p>I still love programming; the satisfaction of dreaming up a solution and making it work is strong, but I don&#x27;t love the software industry.  In fact, as time has gone by, I&#x27;m coming to hate it.

A few weeks ago, I had posted a very basic version of a programming language that I put together, called Dip. I was blown away by the kind and honest feedback given by the community, and have worked on it, adding examples of Dip code so users can get to know the language, adding a learning path for beginners so that they can learn how to code in a streamlined fashion, and also changing the site to match the language’s identity.<p>So now, I (re)introduce you to Dip, a small project I’ve been working on, which also happens to be a programming language targeting beginners. I’ve tried to make the syntax easy to understand, and also tried to make the language easy to read and write for complete beginners. I&#x27;ve tried to eliminate a few issues the Python language has (such as indentation and error messages), though it is up to you to see to what extent Dip succeeds. I’ve also tried to allow Dip to communicate with Python, so users are not limited to Dip’s features, because the way I see it, Dip is not meant to compete with Python, and does not aim to, but I think Dip’s simpler syntax and error messages might be useful to beginners in some cases and get them up the learning ladder, and I would love to see Dip being used as a stepping stone by the Python community, learning the ropes using Dip, and then moving on to Python.<p>You can look at Dip’s website at dip-lang.org.<p>I would love your feedback on how I could improve the language.<p>Also, if you wish to contribute to this small venture of mine, feel free to help me with the core language or the site on Github.","time":1594018185,"title":"Reintroducing Dip – My take on a programming language for beginners","type":"story"},{"by":"latchkey","descendants":1,"id":23745335,"kids":[23746528,23746004],"score":6,"time":1594018098,"title":"Open Source Money","type":"story","url":"https://opensourcemoney.tv/"},{"by":"kaltsturm","descendants":12,"id":23745404,"kids":[23745567,23745554,23745545,23755845,23745424,23745413,23745541,23745613],"score":10,"time":1594018904,"title":"Scrapingworld.com – Scraping Directory: components, providers, knowledge base","type":"story","url":"https://www.scrapingworld.com"},{"by":"ernesto95","descendants":35,"id":23745271,"kids":[23745945,23746162,23755993,23756082,23751407,23748461,23745784,23746647,23750388,23745785],"score":111,"time":1594017348,"title":"The magnetic universe begins to come into view","type":"story","url":"https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-hidden-magnetic-universe-begins-to-come-into-view-20200702/"},{"by":"avoidboringppl","dead":true,"id":23745409,"kids":[23746248,23746362,23746343,23746418,23746451,23745511,23746790],"score":67,"time":1594018953,"title":"Signaling virtuous victimhood as indicators of Dark Triad personalities","type":"story","url":"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-46166-001"},{"by":"polm23","descendants":31,"id":23745254,"kids":[23748033,23745862,23746751,23748113,23746529,23751699,23750577,23747569,23745257,23747378,23749751,23748180],"score":104,"time":1594017199,"title":"Parsing city of origin and destination city from a string","type":"story","url":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59956670/parsing-city-of-origin-destination-city-from-a-string"},{"by":"Gen1us","descendants":5,"id":23745223,"kids":[23746096,23745624,23745698],"score":16,"time":1594016762,"title":"How to process more than 350K requests per month free using 3 free ETA services","type":"story","url":"https://blog.maddevs.io/how-to-make-three-paid-eta-services-one-free-6edc6affface"},{"by":"Acoto","descendants":16,"id":23745231,"kids":[23746677,23747093],"score":6,"time":1594016898,"title":"Show HN: One stop platform to grow your career","type":"story","url":"https://www.theacoto.com/"},{"by":"jbegley","descendants":6,"id":23745126,"kids":[23745293,23745944,23745328],"score":7,"time":1594015289,"title":"The Coronavirus Is Airborne","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html"},{"by":"bambam24","descendants":3,"id":23745141,"kids":[23758894,23745779,23751795,23745495],"score":4,"text":"I wonder which platform&#x2F;sources I can use to find leads for my software hosting company? \nFYI, It’s profitable business last 10 years, I usually sold to my friends and their friends etc.\nI build websites and eCommerce solutions for them.\nAnd yes I’m only 24 years old drop out of collage.","time":1594015528,"title":"How to grow my hosting company?","type":"story"},{"by":"lighttower","descendants":2,"id":23744992,"kids":[23745249,23745129],"score":3,"text":"Has anyone trained a NN to restore audio data that has been degraded with an audio tape?

The last project I made in Django - I used v3.0 and it was still fine although a lot had changed from v1.11. Except of course I forgot DRF a bit and had to throw out some APIs I wrote in it before deciding to roll out my own way in CBVs as going back to docs for custom stuff in DRF was too complicated&#x2F;required unnecessary efforts. Same for allauth, drf-rest-auth, etc. Okay for basic APIs, not as much for customization. Sorry for the digression. And Django 3.0 still doesn&#x27;t have event loop based async processing like Node, at least not fully.<p>Honestly, after working with Node+Express and having to write all the &quot;magic&quot; parts yourself, I feel more light and free, - not having to understand a framework and then thinking about my app&#x27;s business logic later. In Node+Express I can simply scaffold a basic server and start writing routes, integrate with SQL queries, and be done with it. Maybe even install a couple of libs to sort out CORS, session auth, security stuff etc. And the performance is definitely better than running a Django app for simple serialization of DB data and sending that back. The biggest pain is obviously Django ORM - it&#x27;s honestly light years ahead of anything in JS. But I can live without it, having spent a year on manually created migrations in my company that I know can be automated.<p>So, what do you use and recommend for backend development in 2020?\nWhen you have to write a POC quickly for an app idea you have, what&#x27;s the technology you use to flesh its backend out?<p>P.S: This is not a rant against Django - I love Django and my whole career started because of it.

Attribute any possibly offensive tone of my question to my ignorance please.","time":1593963559,"title":"Ask HN: Why do developer advocates exist?","type":"story"},{"by":"onetimemanytime","descendants":5,"id":23739461,"kids":[23739776,23743802],"score":12,"time":1593963453,"title":"Bellagio sportsbook error may be largest past post loss in Vegas history","type":"story","url":"https://www.reviewjournal.com/sports/betting/bellagio-sportsbook-error-may-be-largest-past-post-loss-in-vegas-history-2066855/"},{"by":"boromi","descendants":3,"id":23739559,"kids":[23739598,23739823],"score":2,"time":1593964176,"title":"Julia Language Telemetry on by Default","type":"story","url":"https://discourse.julialang.org/t/pkg-jl-telemetry-should-be-opt-in/42209/189"},{"by":"tomduncalf","descendants":2,"id":23739440,"kids":[23739455,23746095],"score":2,"time":1593963292,"title":"See the summit of Mount Everest in 360 degrees","type":"story","url":"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2020/07/see-what-the-summit-of-mount-everest-looks-like-in-360-degrees-feature/"},{"by":"kipply","descendants":5,"id":23739416,"kids":[23742956,23744032],"score":28,"time":1593963081,"title":"JIT Compilers Are Implemented and Fast: Julia, PyPy, LuaJIT, Graal and More","type":"story","url":"https://carolchen.me/blog/jits-impls/"},{"by":"colinkeeley","descendants":16,"id":23739381,"kids":[23740108,23740291,23740976,23740656,23741349,23740909,23740821,23740624],"score":82,"time":1593962786,"title":"Andrew Wilkinson and Tiny Capital","type":"story","url":"https://colinkeeley.com/blog/andrew-wilkinson-tiny-capital-operating-manual"},{"by":"martinlaz","descendants":39,"id":23739243,"kids":[23740678,23740173,23739690,23740435,23741604,23740412,23751053,23741317,23743246,23740664,23740050,23740086],"score":219,"time":1593961816,"title":"Ridiculous Math Problems","type":"story","url":"http://www.dam.brown.edu/people/mumford/blog/2020/Ridiculous.html"},{"by":"guscost","descendants":4,"id":23739183,"kids":[23739378,23739302],"score":3,"time":1593961379,"title":"Covid-19 Herd Immunity Is Closer Than Antibody Tests Suggest, Say 2 New Studies","type":"story","url":"https://reason.com/2020/07/01/covid-19-herd-immunity-is-much-closer-than-antibody-tests-suggest-say-2-new-studies/"},{"by":"sonabinu","descendants":124,"id":23739163,"kids":[23753217,23754065,23754023,23753464,23754485,23752927,23760227,23753931,23754302,23757473,23755738,23753707,23754436,23757113,23753959,23753272,23753525,23754775],"score":154,"time":1593961230,"title":"Why Can't I Reproduce Their Results?","type":"story","url":"http://theorangeduck.com/page/reproduce-their-results"},{"by":"dsr12","descendants":232,"id":23739076,"kids":[23739633,23739486,23745096,23739680,23739583,23742443,23741808,23740762,23741279,23739437,23742990,23741062,23739467,23742086,23740177,23739805,23739689,23739662,23740765,23739428,23740070,23740117],"score":341,"time":1593960536,"title":"Linus Torvalds: 'I Do No Coding Any More'","type":"story","url":"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/20/07/03/2133201/linus-torvalds-i-do-no-coding-any-more"},{"by":"todsacerdoti","descendants":48,"id":23739074,"kids":[23739948,23739684,23740310,23743627,23740277,23739785],"score":161,"time":1593960526,"title":"Dolphin Progress May and June 2020","type":"story","url":"https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2020/07/05/dolphin-progress-report-may-and-june-2020/"},{"by":"yarapavan","descendants":65,"id":23739002,"kids":[23739749,23739921,23739418,23739330,23740301,23739742,23739886,23739355,23740146,23740562,23739487,23739627,23740645,23740546,23739305,23739600],"score":265,"time":1593959959,"title":"How McKinsey helps companies avoid responsibility","type":"story","url":"https://slate.com/business/2020/06/mckinsey-companies-avoid-responsibility-management-consulting.html"},{"by":"terwin","dead":true,"id":23738988,"kids":[23739889,23739091],"score":1,"text":"Hi.\nI am looking for the best friend:\n1. woman\n2. single\n3. from anywhere (I am in the US)\n4. no kids, but want kids\n5. education level does not matter, if you read this post, it means you have a good education (even if it is self education)\n6. like books and reading\n7. want to travel together\nThat&#x27;s it.

I don&#x27;t really see any new courses being published and recommended on the lists among good oldies. My own experience with stuff that came later also wasn&#x27;t as pleasant, I started dropping courses much more often.<p>The platforms themselves changed significantly:\n1. Switch from fundamental to hands-on subjects like technologies and frameworks.\n2. Switching to paid model (not that I have anything against it, although being poor in a poor country I avoid paying as much as I can and haven&#x27;t paid for a single certificate). This leads to less people checking out the course and giving it a &quot;media coverage&quot;.\n3. Switching from strict start-end date to &quot;take anytime you want&quot;. Because of that the social element for me has been essentially lost, the forums are half-dead.\n4. Increased amount of courses. Together with (1) this makes it hard to find something by random exploration. When I open edx computer science section I have to go through pages and pages of microsoft courses about their technologies.<p>This made me gradually lose interest in MOOCs and switch to books and self-learning.

Letters allows users to sign up, type a letter to their loved-one in prison&#x2F;jail and we handle printing, packaging, stamping and shipping through USPS. It&#x27;s still totally free and unlimited. We&#x27;ve also have went open source. (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ameelio\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ameelio</a>)<p>When I made the post on HN (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23042558\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23042558</a>), announcing the launch, we received SO much support. Many of you contacted us and wanted to contribute. With your help, we were able to scale our operations, we gained several amazing teammates and we developed an amazing product that&#x27;s serving over 5,500 users who&#x27;ve sent around 23,000 letters to their family and friends that are incarcerated. The impact we&#x27;ve made already has been incredible.<p>Letters has been a huge success and we&#x27;ve been planning some things to make it even better. We&#x27;ve revamped the UI with more enhancements coming soon. The next stage for Letters is to focus on scalability and extend functionality to make letters sent from our platform more personal, helpful and even entertaining. We&#x27;ll be adding games that users can send to their loved ones such as Sudoku, Crossword puzzles and even potentially pop-out board games (TBD).

We’re Alpha, Matt and Aaron, co-founders of PostEra (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;postera.ai&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;postera.ai&#x2F;</a>). The title above is quite a mouthful (we used all 80 characters) so we&#x27;ll begin by breaking down what it means.<p>What is medicinal chemistry? It’s part of discovering new drugs. A drug hunter decides what disease to focus on and then selects ‘targets’: usually proteins whose activity is key to the disease. Then they look for a molecule that can ‘hit’ that target and stimulate a response which will hopefully have beneficial effects. Developing such a molecule that is potent and safe is medicinal chemistry.<p>Despite it being a crucial part of drug development, this field has relied on trial-and-error approaches—a very expensive way to muddle toward a drug. Where computational tools have been used, they have emphasized the &#x27;best&#x27; designs without any awareness of what it would take to physically make the drug in a lab and test it. Our approach is to apply computational methods that know how to make these designs.<p>We’ve been working on developing machine learning tools to advance the field for the last 3 years. Alpha formed a lab at Cambridge in 2017 to apply machine learning to drug discovery. Matt joined the group and soon some exciting results began to emerge, particularly in the area of how to make molecules. We published the first model to outperform trained human chemists in predicting the outcomes of chemical reactions. Alpha then got Aaron, his former mathematics classmate and debate partner at Oxford to leave his job for the world of drug discovery.<p>We decided to focus on the one challenge that exists at almost every step: molecules need to be made. No matter how clever it looks on paper, a molecule is worthless unless it can be tested in a lab. The task of actually making molecules, known as chemical synthesis, is often a challenging problem, involving the combinatorial explosion of games like Go with moves that can’t be defined in a simple rulebook.<p>You start with a set of simple molecules which can be combined through chemical reactions (a ‘move’) to form more and more complex molecules, known as the ‘route’, until you arrive at your desired drug candidate. But how to combine these molecules? Trial and error is not an option, given the enormous cost of doing chemistry, and just enumerating all options to a client is unhelpful given that your average molecule can have hundreds of theoretically-possible routes. Searching this tree of routes and scoring the viability of such routes is where ML becomes very powerful.<p>We developed a machine-translation approach which takes in reactants and outputs the product of a reaction; an approach very similar to how Google Translate operates. This allows us to score the viability of each move. We combine this with fast tree search algorithms, used in models like AlphaGo to efficiently search the large combinatorial space of possible reactions.<p>To get this technology in front of users, we&#x27;re building a cloud-based platform. Clients input the molecule they want to be made, our system designs a route for how to make it, and then the client can order this molecule through our platform. We don’t own a lab, but we partner with chemical manufacturers around the world who execute the routes we design. Combining automated chemical synthesis with compound ordering creates a better experience for the drug hunter who wants to focus on their science and just wants a vial with their compound without the cumbersome process of figuring out how to make it and where to get it from.<p>All that is what we were working on until the pandemic hit... and now we can answer the second part of the title: COVID Moonshot.<p>We had just finished YC W20 when a tweet from a team of scientists quickly changed our travel (and company) trajectory. A team of scientists at Diamond Light Source in the UK had shown that a selection of chemical fragments were effective at binding to a key part of the COVID virus. We realised there were hundreds of chemists sitting at home, with their projects on hold, who could help take these fragments and turn them into genuine drug candidates—an open-science approach to crowdsourcing a new drug. We created a platform where designs could be submitted and hoped for maybe 50 to 100 submissions. In the first few weeks, we’ve received over 4000 submissions from 200 scientists around the world.<p>This was the start of a COVID Moonshot initiative that we are now helping lead. It is an international consortium of scientists drawn from academia, biotechs, and pharma, all working pro bono or at cost with no IP claims on any resulting drug candidates. The aim is to find an antiviral candidate for COVID-19 by the end of the year—a ‘moonshot’ of a time frame compared with the standard drug discovery paradigm.<p>That standard paradigm is unfortunately broken when it comes to pandemic-related diseases. Biology and chemistry are hard enough, but things become even intractable when there are little or no commercial incentives to develop new therapies. Sadly, this explains why promising antibiotic companies like Achaogen go bankrupt and why, even after SARS-CoV brought the Far East to a halt in 2003, we still didn’t invest in coronavirus therapies during the last 17 years. For therapies that only become critical once every few decades, we need a new approach to developing drugs.<p>We think that drug hunters can learn something from the CS community and its embrace of open source. Similarly to open-source software development, someone has to manage the roadmap and triage suggestions. For Moonshot, the candidate drug submissions are great but we obviously can’t make and test all of them, so how do you pick the most promising ones? Here is where our technology comes in: it can identify which candidates can be <i>synthesized</i> easily. Since in a pandemic you need to move quickly, prioritizing compounds that can be synthesized easily is a natural triaging mechanism. Where a human chemist would take 3-4 weeks, we were able to design synthetic routes for all submissions within 48 hours. The top route designs were then passed on to our chemical manufacturing partner for synthesis. We’ve now experimentally tested over 500 compounds and found several promising candidates which we are now testing further. All data is publicly available on the site: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;postera.ai&#x2F;covid\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;postera.ai&#x2F;covid</a><p>Inspired by open-source software, we’re seeing advantages of open-science collaboration in areas where market incentives are lacking. We started with the opportunity to connect drug hunters with the latest ML, but have expanded this into a platform that helps connect scientists with each other. This is particularly needed when it comes to drug discovery logistics—the fragment screens are conducted in Oxford and The Weizmann Institute in Israel, computational methods are done by PostEra in California and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, and chemical synthesis is carried out across several countries. Many of the features we are rolling out, such as automated alerts on suggested drug designs, open forum discussions, and live data uploads, feel very akin to a ‘GitHub for drug development’.<p>Identifying biological mechanisms of diseases and forecasting clinical outcomes are huge problems, but we believe that the chemistry stage of drug discovery can become a reliable industry rather than an artisanal craft. Machine learning tech is a key part and we&#x27;re still working on it, but our clients have been constantly reminding us that just the logistical aspects of drug discovery are a great source of pain. Science software is also notoriously hard to use so we&#x27;ve learned that combining good UI with good ML should be our ambition.

Is the law around &quot;sale of company&quot; established to be a full sale of company or can it be a partial sale (e.g. equity to VCs)? Can I effectively pursue legal action against the startup?<p>I&#x27;ve worked at the startup before they had major traction and had equity as part of the my compensation with a 4 year vesting period. After my equity has fully vested and before the company publicly announced a major round of VC fundraising (first round ever), the company asked me to sign a new agreement without any equity. I was sent the a new employment contract at 9am and was asked to sign it by 5pm during a busy work day. I didn&#x27;t have enough time to carefully review its terms or seek advice of counsel. Few months later, the startup fired me, so I curiously reviewed my 2 employment and noticed that the equity clause was missing from the new agreement, thus sparking this question.<p>Under the old employment contract, the terms of the equity were that I had to be a full-time employee at the time of &quot;sale of company&quot;. Does partial sale of company (e.g. equity) to VCs count as &quot;sale of company&quot; and thus trigger a bonus for me?<p>Please ask clarifying questions if you need more details before providing an answer. I greatly appreciate your advice.","time":1593553921,"title":"Ask HN: Is VC fundraising considered a partial sale of the company?","type":"story"},{"by":"ibejoeb","descendants":2,"id":23695228,"kids":[23695321,23695461],"score":5,"time":1593554060,"title":"Airbnb to use names and profile photos to infer race of users","type":"story","url":"https://www.airbnb.com/resources/hosting-homes/a/a-new-way-were-fighting-discrimination-on-airbnb-201"},{"by":"code-faster","descendants":72,"id":23694908,"kids":[23697760,23696344,23698855,23696533,23696574,23695508,23698078,23699280,23697710,23700551,23699144,23700365,23697789,23697443,23700404,23700938,23696391,23697478,23699715,23698171],"score":205,"time":1593551907,"title":"Mastering Jq: Part 1","type":"story","url":"https://codefaster.substack.com/p/mastering-jq-part-1-59c"},{"by":"diodorus","descendants":38,"id":23694756,"kids":[23720775,23720199,23719941,23719601,23719569,23721108,23720279,23720278],"score":23,"time":1593551064,"title":"Who Is History’s Worst Political Adviser?","type":"story","url":"https://www.historytoday.com/archive/head-head/who-history’s-worst-political-adviser"},{"by":"seesawtron","descendants":4,"id":23694760,"kids":[23694780,23696775],"score":2,"time":1593551099,"title":"Ask HN: How to hide HN karma/scores from my user account?","type":"story"},{"by":"msc101","descendants":2,"id":23694744,"kids":[23694860,23694906],"score":4,"time":1593550971,"title":"Gitlab Reduces Bug Bounties on HackerOne","type":"story","url":"https://hackerone.com/gitlab/bounty_table_versions?change=2020-06-30T19%3A02%3A31.649Z"},{"by":"jakogut","descendants":101,"id":23694667,"kids":[23695477,23696489,23696301,23695831,23695979,23697816,23695282,23695376,23696028,23701184,23695240,23699034,23696431,23695965,23700837,23698185,23695844,23695256,23699055,23696017,23695834,23698523,23695245,23695618],"score":226,"time":1593550475,"title":"Learn Lua in 15 Minutes (2013)","type":"story","url":"http://tylerneylon.com/a/learn-lua/"},{"by":"forthwall","descendants":2,"id":23694498,"kids":[23703781,23694911],"score":4,"time":1593549449,"title":"The End of Elliot","type":"story","url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V3Sfm2ZNLxFjNFSExKxGkjZ3BRVBVIaAdvrdf8S5W44/edit"},{"by":"mudil","descendants":52,"id":23694451,"kids":[23694729,23694924,23695043,23694711,23694857,23694691,23694754,23694661,23694741,23697098,23694781,23698322,23694651],"score":43,"time":1593549184,"title":"On Behalf of Environmentalists, I Apologize for the Climate Scare","type":"story","url":"https://environmentalprogress.org/big-news/2020/6/29/on-behalf-of-environmentalists-i-apologize-for-the-climate-scare"},{"by":"cheeew","descendants":12,"id":23694414,"kids":[23695238,23696000,23700704,23694767,23698774,23694884,23695440,23695902,23724886,23700780],"score":18,"text":"I&#x27;m getting ready to make a new personal site and wanted to grab some opinions from the HN community as to what makes a great personal website.<p>What&#x27;s the one or two things you look for when exploring a new personal site?

We&#x27;ve been working with SVB to setup a line-of-credit just to have in case we need it, and we recently talked with them about their Innovators card. Unfortunately their sales people cannot show you any kind of demo so that you can see how it works or what the UI looks like even. This is a tough ask as the only way to see it is to sign up for an account and start issuing cards. We also talked with Brex about their solution and even looked into Expensify&#x27;s card.<p>Brex was able to show us a demo and as part of the trial we attached our SVB account which causes a $0.01 deposit and withdrawal. After doing this we received an email from our SVB sales rep acknowledging the transaction: &quot;It looks like I see a penny test from Brex on June 3rd so it may be that you just set something up.&quot; I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s buried in the SVB ToS, but SVB sales reps looking into our transactions didn&#x27;t sit quite right with me. Then we told them that we decided to go with Brex because we liked the solution and not being able to get a demo from SVB made it basically a non-starter. A couple days later we get a call from a Managing Director and he tells us that the line-of-credit will need to be venture debt and backed by equity or warrants, which we&#x27;re not interested in since this is only a rainy-day LoC and we&#x27;ve got plenty of money in our SVB account.

This approach works well for me because IDEs and debuggers eagerly notify me about errors in my code.<p>Can you recommend any good self-study books that:<p>- introduce methods and concepts from engineering and math,<p>- show you how to code them,<p>- equip you with just enough intuition to let you apply the methods and to follow more advanced, traditional textbooks?<p>Ideally, the books would:<p>- be applied,<p>- use free software,<p>- not rely on custom packages written by the author,<p>- not focus on data science and statistics, because I have a pretty good understanding of these areas.<p>I am particularly interested in signal processing, control systems, simulations, and difference equations, but I am really open to any recommendations.<p>Thanks!","time":1593396323,"title":"Ask HN: Recommendations for applied engineering and math books for programmers?","type":"story"},{"by":"bryanrasmussen","descendants":43,"id":23673534,"kids":[23673945,23674194,23673972,23677738,23675513,23673683,23677118,23750862,23675368,23675702,23677899,23673677,23681107,23685056,23674964,23677295,23681701,23673711,23678425,23683386,23690050,23695062,23677084,23676261],"score":494,"time":1593394242,"title":"Textures.js is a JavaScript library for creating SVG patterns","type":"story","url":"https://riccardoscalco.it/textures/"},{"by":"victornomad","descendants":32,"id":23673323,"kids":[23678817,23680018,23674450,23675804,23675866,23688043,23674495,23702489,23676813],"score":57,"time":1593392091,"title":"Show HN: PHONK, JavaScript scripting for Android devices","type":"story","url":"https://phonk.app"},{"by":"kierank","descendants":3,"id":23673275,"kids":[23708906,23674274],"score":15,"time":1593391486,"title":"Two Chinese Video Encoders","type":"story","url":"https://blog.sesse.net/blog/tech/2020-06-28-00-02_two_chinese_video_encoders.html"},{"by":"yasp","descendants":35,"id":23673286,"kids":[23674010,23674323,23674259,23678795],"score":50,"time":1593391611,"title":"Yelp: Local Economic Impact Report","type":"story","url":"https://www.yelpeconomicaverage.com/yelp-coronavirus-economic-impact-report.html"},{"by":"samspenc","descendants":81,"id":23673039,"kids":[23673298,23673325,23673322,23673252,23673365,23673378,23673268,23697255,23673531,23673302,23673237,23673333,23673535],"score":91,"time":1593388715,"title":"Many Covid Patients Have Terrifying Hallucinations and Delirium","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/28/health/coronavirus-delirium-hallucinations.html"},{"by":"inamiyar","descendants":3,"id":23672885,"kids":[23673395,23674821],"score":2,"text":"Recently I had the chance to read https:&#x2F;&#x2F;invisible-island.net&#x2F;ncurses&#x2F;ncurses-license.html , as well as look into Creative Commons CC0 ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;creativecommons.org&#x2F;publicdomain&#x2F;zero&#x2F;1.0&#x2F; ).

I would argue that in that point the divergence stems either from a difference in understanding of the problem or different approaches in solving the respective (complex) task. Since both scenarios could cause problems down the line in the project, the team should step back, clarify the requirements &amp; approach to the solution and break it down into further tasks that are trivial enough to be executed in the smallest unit of estimation.<p>In summary, estimation is the wrong problem to solve, the team should spend the time to thoroughly understand the requirements and truly define the solution approach, leaving the time estimate to be just a matter of counting the generated tasks and multiplying that with the agreed smallest unit of work.<p>While the above is a hypothetical scenario, what are your thoughts around it?

So my questions are...<p>1) Is net-tools&#x2F;ifconfig still in development for BSD?\n2) If not, then when did it end?\n3) If so, then do you have any idea why it&#x27;s still using defaults based on classful networks?","time":1593195509,"title":"Questions: History of Ifconfig","type":"story"},{"by":"todsacerdoti","descendants":94,"id":23655173,"kids":[23655242,23657735,23656807,23656599,23655463,23655363,23658377,23655615,23655514,23655774,23656445,23657480,23659009],"score":168,"time":1593195502,"title":"A New Standard Deal","type":"story","url":"https://blog.ycombinator.com/a-new-standard-deal/"},{"by":"reaperducer","descendants":4,"id":23655032,"kids":[23655614,23655694],"score":6,"time":1593194732,"title":"Uber, Lyft Charge More for Riders Going to Non-White Neighborhoods, Study Shows","type":"story","url":"https://blockclubchicago.org/2020/06/26/uber-lyft-charges-more-for-riders-going-to-chicagos-non-white-neighborhoods-study-shows/"},{"by":"kyawzazaw","descendants":7,"id":23655018,"kids":[23662402,23667854,23655445,23655223,23655611,23662373],"score":1,"time":1593194652,"title":"Ask HN: Did you buy a HEY email?","type":"story"},{"by":"op03","descendants":3,"id":23655019,"kids":[23658412,23656749,23655852],"score":27,"time":1593194655,"title":"Unilever pauses Advertising on Facebook and Twitter till year end","type":"story","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/26/unilever-pauses-facebook-and-twitter-advertising-for-rest-of-2020-due-to-polarized-atmosphere-in-us.html"},{"by":"MindGods","descendants":41,"id":23654973,"kids":[23658063,23657087,23659416,23655337,23655385,23658208,23655947,23656178,23659879,23657773,23660280,23656653],"score":150,"time":1593194407,"title":"PHP Insights: Analyze the code quality of PHP projects","type":"story","url":"https://phpinsights.com"},{"by":"dangerman","descendants":81,"id":23654874,"kids":[23656087,23656605,23657839,23657432,23655871,23655249,23655940,23655605,23656058,23660430,23656697,23655970,23655908,23655461,23655816,23659195,23656351,23658310,23660197,23657210,23660190,23655802,23657223,23658753,23657745,23658565],"score":99,"time":1593193976,"title":"The failure of Sprig","type":"story","url":"https://twitter.com/gaganbiyani/status/1265755248922157066"},{"by":"lobbly","descendants":38,"id":23654843,"kids":[23656615,23662739,23656225,23656194],"score":50,"time":1593193853,"title":"Ben Smith on the rise of Substack and independent journalists [video]","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xgLOHW42Nw#t=12"},{"by":"dplso","descendants":1,"id":23655153,"kids":[23656214,23655321],"score":2,"time":1593195418,"title":"Is the Whonix project run by fascists?","type":"story","url":"https://micahflee.com/2020/06/is-the-whonix-project-run-by-fascists/"},{"by":"harshamv22","descendants":22,"id":23654789,"kids":[23659283,23663755,23656841,23655204,23663126,23655256,23659430,23656331,23655834,23660622,23654954,23655642,23678201,23654845],"score":13,"text":"With a lot of hype around paid email services like hey.com and superhuman - Is it worth all the money or is it just a hype?","time":1593193660,"title":"Ash HN: Is it worth investing in paid email services hey/superhuman?","type":"story"},{"by":"danso","descendants":150,"id":23654435,"kids":[23660731,23660673,23660985,23660957,23662989,23660711,23660831,23662840,23660904,23661559,23660720,23661182,23665425,23662563,23662911],"score":67,"time":1593192026,"title":"Multistate Disagreement over the Length of the Foot to End","type":"story","url":"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/multistate-disagreement-over-the-length-of-the-foot-to-end/"},{"by":"rfreytag","descendants":138,"id":23654393,"kids":[23660352,23660608,23660385,23660090,23660292,23660791,23660866,23661707,23660846,23661439,23660818,23661798,23660121,23660488,23660767,23659978,23661512,23660290,23661462,23660477,23661864,23659972,23660699,23660724],"score":105,"time":1593191777,"title":"Silurian Hypothesis: Were There Civilizations on Earth Before Humans?

I&#x27;ve been out of college working full time as a software dev for a couple of years now. I&#x27;ve gotten promoted and a couple of raises so I guess I&#x27;m not terrible at my job (though I&#x27;m far from the best). However, anyone who knows me personally, knows how much I really don&#x27;t like my work.<p>And that is probably the biggest issue with my current job. It has absolutely no value to me, outside of money. It&#x27;s like being in college and writing essays just to get it done. Which is fine I guess, but I keep dreaming of a future where I could look forward to the work week and doing interesting stuff and not just yearn for the weekend. And it&#x27;s so hard faking interest in things I&#x27;m not interested in. Really exhausting.<p>So then many people ask me, why don&#x27;t you just switch jobs? And I&#x27;ve tried, but many of the jobs I come across in tech do not excite me. I&#x27;m not interested in building real estate apps, or finance tools, or marketing tools, etc. In fact, the only time I truly like even doing dev work if it&#x27;s for my own personal projects or building stuff that directly impacts humanity (very cliche, I know). Like stuff that SpaceX is doing with low-orbit satellites I found really fascinating. I&#x27;ve also tried non-profits but many of them can only afford to bring a dev on as a volunteer.<p>So then what am I interested in doing then? I don&#x27;t know. Maybe starting over, and going into psychiatry or being a radio host, or even politician. Unfortunately, I also don&#x27;t want any more debt. So there&#x27;s that issue.<p>Has anyone else experienced this and have any advice? I know this is absolutely a position of privilege as there are people in the world who don&#x27;t have such choices. So I hate complaining but could use some advice.","time":1593117274,"title":"Ask HN: Did I get into the wrong field?","type":"story"},{"by":"ur-whale","descendants":280,"id":23645305,"kids":[23646593,23648335,23648148,23646303,23647227,23647738,23647864,23648005,23646228,23648323,23646459,23649524,23648002,23645433,23650570,23658690,23650791,23647816,23649159,23647052,23650577,23654635,23649547,23647070,23650580,23650757,23652170,23648253,23647595,23646638,23646916],"score":716,"time":1593116963,"title":"Blackballed by PayPal, Sci-Hub switches to Bitcoin","type":"story","url":"https://www.coindesk.com/blackballed-by-paypal-scientific-paper-pirate-takes-bitcoin-donations"},{"by":"justaguyhere","descendants":3,"id":23645254,"kids":[23645573,23655286,23652694],"score":3,"time":1593116711,"title":"Ask HN: Anyone built a tiny house by yourself?

Personal data is primarily collected and used by the advertising industry.  Large ad companies such as Facebook and Google already admit that microtargeting with personal data is being misused.  Google voluntarily restricts targeting for political advertising [1] while Facebook has called for legislation [2].<p>If we were to simply ban the use of personal data beyond a few key items like age, gender and zip code for delivering ads there would be less reason to collect more data.  Advertising companies will still earn ample profit from their ads with contextual targeting (e.g. showing ads related to search terms or related to the topic of a post or news item being displayed on the screen) and coarse grained targeting.<p>The simplicity of the rule would simpler to understand and enforce and would be much less prone to loopholes exploited by the sophisticated legal teams at the largest advertising companies.  This creates a more level playing field between large and small companies perhaps enabling increased competition.<p>Banning targeted advertising is not a panacea for protecting personal data.  Other industries can still extract value including insurance companies that may adjust prices up or down based on your data or retailers may offer discounts or enhanced services to its most profitable customers. Even so by restricting the most profitable and prevalent misuse of personal data perhaps we can protect it.<p>What do you think?

I&#x27;ve had some conversations about local full-time roles, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re the right option for me. I&#x27;ve worn many different hats at my current position, which means that I don&#x27;t have deep experience in any specific area, and moreover, I&#x27;m too stressed out and burnt out to psych myself up for the traditional interview gauntlet. But at the same time, I feel like I really need to get out ASAP and get a (virtual) change of scenery.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about throwing my hat into the ring on the various freelancing sites and spending the next six months or so doing a combination of remote part-time freelance work and learning and personal projects to put me in a better position for my next step. I realize that the pay will be a fraction of what I&#x27;m used to as a full-time dev in the US, but I can weather that for a while; I&#x27;m more concerned about keeping my mind active and having something concrete to list on my resume. But the freelancing world is brand-new to me, and I have lots of questions: do I need to worry that my skills won&#x27;t be up to snuff? How hard will it be to find work as a new freelancer in the current environment? Are there pitfalls or other options that I&#x27;m overlooking? Am I crazy to think that this plan will allow me to reduce my stress levels, build up some confidence, and refresh my skills before seeking a more traditional job next year? I&#x27;m wondering if anyone on HN has trod a similar path and can provide any advice, especially in light of the current situation with the pandemic.","time":1593095117,"title":"Ask HN: Is transitioning from a full-time position to freelancing practical?","type":"story"},{"by":"theodorejb","descendants":10,"id":23640966,"kids":[23645387,23649481],"score":31,"time":1593094413,"title":"Angular 10 Now Available","type":"story","url":"https://blog.angular.io/version-10-of-angular-now-available-78960babd41"},{"by":"imartin2k","descendants":342,"id":23641005,"kids":[23641695,23641407,23641439,23641740,23641333,23641878,23643898,23642668,23641821,23642356,23641579,23641534,23641951,23645050,23641623,23643178,23642857,23647398,23644435,23641678,23644437,23644880,23641234,23641479,23642951,23641317,23641200],"score":506,"time":1593094607,"title":"Almost 1 in 3 pilots in Pakistan have fake licenses, aviation minister says","type":"story","url":"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/25/business/pakistan-fake-pilot-intl-hnk/index.html"},{"by":"joering2","descendants":153,"id":23640824,"kids":[23641633,23641488,23641361,23641889,23641163,23641436,23642155,23641824,23641498,23641999,23642073,23641430,23641933,23641539,23641798,23641375,23641464,23641583],"score":162,"time":1593093579,"title":"Tesla gave workers permission to stay home, then sent termination notices","type":"story","url":"https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Tesla-gave-workers-permission-to-stay-home-rather-15365312.php"},{"by":"SenHeng","descendants":3,"id":23640751,"kids":[23640768,23641060],"score":2,"time":1593093203,"title":"Western Digital adds “Red Plus” branding for non-SMR hard drives","type":"story","url":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/western-digital-adds-red-plus-branding-for-non-smr-hard-drives/"},{"by":"ytch","descendants":97,"id":23640746,"kids":[23641170,23641054,23640963,23640780,23641022,23641265,23641501,23640873,23641240,23641037,23641158,23641218,23641250,23641175,23641355,23641194,23641263,23641225,23641187],"score":83,"time":1593093163,"title":"Craig Federighi confirms Apple Silicon Macs will not support booting other OS","type":"story","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/hfkdlg/craig_federighi_confirms_apple_silicon_macs_will/"},{"by":"promotino","descendants":4,"id":23640777,"kids":[23645717,23652632,23651990],"score":9,"time":1593093325,"title":"Show HN: Relanote – a note-taking tool to help you connect the dots","type":"story","url":"https://relanote.com/"},{"by":"pmuens","descendants":61,"id":23640762,"kids":[23644722,23642204,23642568,23643280,23644036,23648765,23642582],"score":156,"time":1593093255,"title":"Logistic regression from scratch","type":"story","url":"https://philippmuens.com/logistic-regression-from-scratch/"},{"by":"mdszy","descendants":2,"id":23640797,"kids":[23643007,23640806],"score":3,"time":1593093450,"title":"Ignition Maker Edition","type":"story","url":"https://inductiveautomation.com/ignition/maker-edition"},{"by":"dartf","descendants":5,"id":23640681,"kids":[23670432,23640774,23640927,23640742],"score":3,"text":"I&#x27;m a self-taught typist and my previous attempts to learn touch typing weren&#x27;t very successful.

background. I&#x27;ve started to code around 15 years ago. I&#x27;ve started from C and C++, learned Java. Coded many things for fun (IRC Bot, A never finished OS Kernel, a never finished graphics engine, basic 2D Game with SFML, Qt Sprite editor, Java based ICQ Clone and etc).<p>At some point I&#x27;ve switched to PHP with HTML, CSS and JS which got me my first job around 10 years ago. Since then, I consider myself a web developer - a title that on one hand feeds me and pay my bills (and I&#x27;m very grateful for that) and on the other hand - is not really that fun and or rewarding (more on that later). Around 6 years ago I&#x27;ve developed interest in Node.js via side project which eventually helped me to land a Node.js job and get away for the slowly dying PHP. In my spare time I continued to explore Node.js, moved to TypeScript, developed skills in FE frameworks such as React.<p>And recently I woke up and found myself in my early thirties, no longer the young kid with &quot;unlimited&quot; free time to try and explore different areas and fields (game dev, os dev, desktop applications) and having troubles to run behind all the new tech and cool stuff that keeps popping up.<p>And here I stand, asking my self: How do I move next? Since the field that PHP and JavaScript occupies are relatively easy to get it, eventually it will be overfilled with younger developers and in order to stay in that market, I&#x27;ll need to provide extra on top of my Node.JS knowledge. And I eager to do more harder and rewarding stuff other than writing API Gateways that fetch and write data to DB.<p>So hence my question: What&#x27;s next? How do you stay up to date? Do you continue to explore your current field of employment and staying in a small set of languages? Do you try different fields? Do you have side projects and are they related to your jobs field? Are you trying to develop in one way (i.e. Backend Engineer) or trying to be the &quot;Jack of all trades&quot; (i.e. Backend, Frontend, Desktop, GameDev)?","time":1593081167,"title":"Ask HN: Developers – how do you stay up to date?","type":"story"},{"by":"jowdones","descendants":6,"id":23639046,"kids":[23640737,23641943,23639195],"score":7,"text":"Godwin&#x27;s law: &quot;As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 100%&quot;.<p>Godwin&#x27;s law for programmers: &quot;As software development grows longer, the probability of emergence of an improvised in-house scripted language (as bad as Nazis or Hitler) approaches 100%&quot;.","time":1593081380,"title":"In-House Languages","type":"story"},{"by":"pseudolus","descendants":19,"id":23638969,"kids":[23648990,23648853,23648663,23651480,23648308,23648656,23649113],"score":83,"time":1593080687,"title":"The Ising model: a cartoon picture of magnets that became ubiquitous in science","type":"story","url":"https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-cartoon-picture-of-magnets-that-has-transformed-science-20200624/"},{"by":"Brett_S","descendants":3,"id":23639037,"kids":[23641156,23639159],"score":27,"time":1593081224,"title":"Surprising: Causes of Poverty","type":"story","url":"https://reliefweb.int/report/world/top-9-causes-global-poverty"},{"by":"duncanawoods","descendants":4,"id":23638818,"kids":[23639664,23639160,23645349],"score":15,"time":1593079088,"title":"How the Virus Won","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-spread.html"},{"by":"polm23","descendants":3,"id":23638795,"kids":[23655048,23638830,23651131],"score":6,"time":1593078864,"title":"The art and science of naming prescription drugs (2016)","type":"story","url":"https://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/25/health/art-of-drug-naming/index.html"},{"by":"rayhano","descendants":3,"id":23638746,"kids":[23638747,23638758],"score":2,"time":1593078486,"title":"We use a kid’s story book to align product assumptions","type":"story","url":"https://youtu.be/4PhiNDzVGnY"},{"by":"kazade","descendants":2,"id":23638676,"kids":[23638683,23638955],"score":5,"time":1593077693,"title":"Server Side Rendering React App with Deno","type":"story","url":"https://dev.p.ota.to/post/server-side-rendering-react-app-with-deno-4qf28vm8axb/"},{"by":"denzil_correa","descendants":159,"id":23638624,"kids":[23640013,23639130,23640571,23644667,23639194,23640296,23639116,23639297,23641322,23638935,23638827,23639998,23639203],"score":210,"time":1593077178,"title":"Wirecard files for insolvency after financial hole laid bare","type":"story","url":"https://www.dw.com/en/wirecard-files-for-insolvency-after-financial-hole-laid-bare/a-53936447"},{"by":"mcd1","descendants":2,"id":23638342,"kids":[23638353,23638346],"score":2,"text":"[deleted]","time":1593074753,"title":"[deleted]","type":"story"},{"by":"daniilkhanin","descendants":6,"id":23638294,"kids":[23650581,23638399,23638314,23638377,23638347,23638486,23638482],"score":6,"text":"Hi, everyone!<p>I&#x27;ve made new type generation on P&amp;L plan from unit economics.

everyone hates their applicant tracking system. ATSes have become these clunky, workflow pieces of software, mostly because they cater to recruiting teams and the compliance&#x2F;workflow needs of enterprises (every ATS wants&#x2F;has moved upmarket). It&#x27;s quite shocking how little true innovation there has been in how companies hire.<p>The problems are too many to count, but here are two that I find particularly self-defeating when hiring: i) job descriptions that are a copy&#x2F;paste (and fail to engage any reasonably talented person who knows their worth) and ii) how companies review and respond to applicants. A good ATS should help bring an order of magnitude improvement to this.<p>Hiring managers today rarely spend the time doing the work of hiring and have outsourced much of it to the recruiter, including something as important as screening&#x2F;filtering applicants. In-house talent folk&#x2F;recruiters will put up with these systems because they have to. Early stage and mid-sized companies often don&#x27;t need much of this complexity.<p>Hiring therefore has become a painful exercise for all involved, not in the least the candidate.

What do you suffer from in your current hiring process&#x2F;ATS? What do you hate (enough to truly desire an alternative)?","time":1593013571,"title":"Ask HN: Thoughts on Applicant Tracking

My parents kept relocating throughout my early childhood which, I read, are the formative years of social skills. As a child I withdrew to books and other solitary activities. In school I was bullied a lot and found &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;-style violence to be an answer. Relations with my parents are complicated; we can&#x27;t find ways to express our love. I don&#x27;t talk to my syblings. I find small talk excruciating and have low tolerance for anything I can&#x27;t find purpose in. I enjoy tet-a-tetes but hate groups. My place is a mess which I do not mind. I work out a lot and am health-conscious. I have no patience for details. I am a serial job hopper because after a few months I end up having poisoned both my social and professional context beyond repair. Finding employment used to be easy because I mastered the interview game. I enjoy the thrill of interviewing, the validation of receiving an offer, handing in my resignation, moving to a new place and starting a new life. But lately I am becoming sloppy in interviews, making mistakes, being too sure of myself and consequently not getting offers. The realisation creeps up my spine that I am losing the one game I was good at, which was my escape from reality and that I might be stuck here forever.","time":1592944760,"title":"Ask HN: I have no friends.

To give people access to our project where we have put all our free time in for the last 6 months.<p>We decided that we have the beta until September 1. Is a 2&#x2F;3-month period normal for a beta? Or is this to short or to long?\nOur beta is free for everybody.\nWe introduced an early supporter coupon for people who want to support us and want to upgrade for paid plan. We handout a 50% discount. Smart? Or is this way to cheap?\nIn the coming months we are collecting feedback and building out our marketing page.

Technically, DVC codifies your data and machine learning pipelines as text metafiles (with pointers to actual data in S3&#x2F;GCP&#x2F;Azure&#x2F;SSH) while you use Git for the actual versioning. DevOps folks call this approach GitOps or more specifically in this case - DataOps or MLOps.<p>We’ve been working towards 1.0 since we started 3 years ago. What began as my pet project now has 100+ code contributors, 100+ documentation contributors, and thousands of users.<p>Our community has taught us a lot - here are some of the biggest lessons:<p>1. Users say the serverless and distributed nature of DVC (inherited from the underlying Git) is one of its &quot;killer features&quot;.<p>2. To share ML projects within and between teams, it’s not enough to track only files and pipelines. You also need metrics, plot and hyperparameter tracking. In DVC 1.0 we implemented hyper-parameter diffs, metrics and plot diffs right from Git history.<p>3. In DataOps, data transfer optimization is huge. Large deep learning models, millions of images in datasets, etc. We doubled down on optimizing 1.0.<p>4. ML pipelines evolve faster than data engineering pipelines and need to be easy to change. In 1.0, we’ve simplified the pipeline metafile format.<p>5. More and more teams use DVC as a part of CI&#x2F;CD for ML and other MLOps tools.

As such, the owners are responsible for their maintenance, safety, and security. While damage to the undersea cables themselves are highly present and well documented, attacks (or accidents) on and in the landing stations seem to not be present at all. These attacks could be anything from bombing, to sabotage, or wiretapping.<p>Undersea cables that are not immediately located on the shore are extremely hard to reach (on the ocean floor) and mostly damaged by ship anchors. There has been intentional cutting of the cables with the intent to sell them, but single cable failures often do not cause any damage to the global internet traffic. By attacking a landing station, you could take out all the cables which are bundled there. This has been identified as a highly attractive target to terrorists and state-actors [1][4].<p>So we&#x27;re stumped, if taking out these landing stations is &quot;so easy&quot;, and would cause a great amount of damage, why are no attacks on them reported?<p>Thank you!<p>[1]: Michael Sechrist; New Threats, Old Technology: Vulnerabilities in Undersea Communications Cable Network Management

Though he luckily survived, this was quite the wakeup call—he had to change his lifestyle habits immediately, or else he’d have to deal with painful, worsening chronic issues for the rest of his life.<p>These changes—exercise, nutrition, sleep, and reducing stress—are hard as is, but even more so for folks over 50. Most wellness apps are designed for motivated millennials, making them feel less relatable to older adults. They don’t take into account evolving health needs, joint issues, or technical limitations. Personal trainers and nutritionists are expensive long-term and often inaccessible. And because our older loved ones are at higher risk of COVID complications due to their age, they won’t be able to return to gyms for the foreseeable future.<p>That’s why we started Mighty Health. Everything is designed intentionally for people over 50:<p>1. Coaching: A personal coach keeping them motivated through SMS, providing a real human relationship<p>2. Exercise: At home workout videos that are easy on the joints, led by top-rated certified trainers<p>3. Nutrition: A personalized plan and grocery list designed by cardiologists for heart health<p>4. Reminders: Preventative health checkup notifications (based on their age and gender) and medication reminders<p>5. Celebrations: Texts to family members about milestones in the program so you can celebrate together<p>Our app is simple to set up and use, accommodating large and high contrast text. We chose SMS (through Twilio&#x2F;Front) for coaching because it’s a more familiar medium, like texting with your family. We integrate with Apple Healthkit and Google Fit, as well as a number of cellular blood pressure cuffs and scales.<p>Dr. Bernard Chang, our medical co-founder, is the Vice Chair of Research at Columbia University’s Department of Emergency Medicine and leads our team of physicians, trainers, and coaches who develop our plans and content.<p>These plans are optimized for health goals specific to people over 50, such as losing weight to prevent chronic diseases, becoming stronger&#x2F;decreasing joint pain, or reducing their risk of heart disease. On average, 85% of our users stick to our plans for at least 12 weeks and lose ~10 pounds.<p>We’d love for you to check out our website at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mightyhealth.com&#x2F;gift\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mightyhealth.com&#x2F;gift</a> and are eager to hear your feedback and ideas below.

I am stressed, depressed and I literally have nothing to look forward to, and feeling cornered might be the cause of my constant illness.<p>My boss passed away from cancer last month. I am a director and have a big minority share. The company is doing great, it&#x27;s remote, small (4 FT employees) and worth a few millions. The boss before dying delegated his work, the idea was selling after his death, but whoever inherited his majority share don&#x27;t want to sell now, &quot;probably next year&quot;. They don&#x27;t know anything about the business, so I have to do all the tech work I was doing before + all the business decision now, until _they_ decide it&#x27;s the right time to sell. I signed up to write code, not to wear both the CTO and CEO hats.<p>I live alone. I don&#x27;t have any friends nor family in this country. Every single one left and went abroad for one reason or the other. I talk to family and old friends who all live abroad via the Internet, but no-one has told me &quot;hello&quot; in person in 6 months. My mother hasn&#x27;t worked in a decade and I&#x27;ve been giving her some money every month to help her get by.<p>I&#x27;m anxious, now it&#x27;s a panic attack every few days, depression, I can&#x27;t watch a movie for more than 10 minutes, I used to love gaming, I don&#x27;t have the energy to even boot one up. I keep the business afloat, do what needs to be done, but I haven&#x27;t implemented a new feature in months.<p>I am out of shape because now eating is an emotional outlet. I feel nauseous when waking up or after eating. I leave the house twice a month for a quick walk, and I&#x27;m too self-conscious about my appearance to do it more often.<p>My health and sanity have declined quickly, and I don&#x27;t know what to do.<p>I can&#x27;t quit, it would kill the company and I don&#x27;t want to lose my share of it. Making friends is hard. Getting fit is a long journey.

I wanted to reach out to ask for advice around going to US Grad School as an international student, particularly with the aim of moving to the Bay Area to contribute to the startup ecosystem - perhaps with my own startup or perhaps to help others!<p>So at this time, the situation is a very fortunate one. I have a full-ride scholarship to Harvard this fall to continue my Architectural Studies (my gentleman&#x27;s hobby...) Fortunately, I also get to skip the first year which means the course is 2.5 years with the last 1.5 years of those allowing me to take whatever option courses throughout Harvard and MIT - I&#x27;m curious about too much so that possibility is awesome.<p>On the other hand, I have now developed a lot of doubts about whether the overall situation will be worth it, both short and long term.<p>- I am British&#x2F;Irish based in London. Thus have short term immigration problems despite having all visa paperwork.<p>- First semester+ will be remote (the embassies are closed and they will be bound to have a ton of backlog to work through, providing COVID doesn&#x27;t again provoke the government to shut down immigration in winter). Working alone without really meeting anyone properly&#x2F;having the campus experience really drops the value of going back to university.<p>- Unfortunately for all, it seems quite likely that international working visas will be attacked and reduced (H1-B, OPT etc). Another drop in value.<p>- My self-propelled study (learning now to pull together software the past year), would be slowed down significantly. At least on my own, I would be able to learn much more outside of a university. Especially a remote university.<p>- I have some fantastic opportunities in London where I would actually be paid to go to university, with all the uncertainty, this option is getting more attractive.<p>Thus it&#x27;s a bit more of a nuanced than that I&#x27;m used to!","time":1592514132,"title":"Ask HN: Advice on (Harvard) Grad School?","type":"story"},{"by":"diodorus","descendants":14,"id":23567786,"kids":[23573699,23575747,23576161,23575528],"score":37,"time":1592512969,"title":"Paleolithic French didn’t let their dead rest peacefully","type":"story","url":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/06/paleolithic-french-didnt-let-their-dead-rest-peacefully/"},{"by":"mxbck","descendants":338,"id":23567744,"kids":[23568317,23568282,23568126,23568764,23568259,23568217,23570387,23569240,23569058,23568334,23571972,23568433,23568381,23571360,23569445,23576676,23568016,23572211,23569145,23568088,23570814,23570970,23568163,23569546,23571549,23572727,23570027,23568670,23570175,23570403,23575554,23569857,23572628,23568314,23575896,23573677,23574232,23573430,23569657,23568291,23573204,23570397,23575474,23570233,23568143,23570044,23568218],"score":786,"time":1592512751,"title":"The Return of the 90s Web","type":"story","url":"https://mxb.dev/blog/the-return-of-the-90s-web/"},{"by":"luciandan","descendants":3,"id":23567536,"kids":[23567537,23567579],"score":2,"time":1592511664,"title":"Just launched Monitive: Detect downtime before your customers do","type":"story","url":"https://monitive.com"},{"by":"ted0","descendants":16,"id":23567366,"kids":[23569319,23568948,23569548,23568399,23568465,23568682],"score":62,"time":1592510879,"title":"Namecheap vs. Facebook on Privacy","type":"story","url":"https://www.namecheap.com/blog/the-secret-fight-for-your-personal-information/"},{"by":"throwaway888abc","descendants":44,"id":23567276,"kids":[23567965,23568058,23568047,23567985,23568078,23568027,23567869,23567913,23567841],"score":27,"time":1592510429,"title":"Washington's rush to smash tech's liability protection","type":"story","url":"https://www.axios.com/washingtons-rush-to-smash-techs-liability-protection-deb16ceb-580a-4125-909a-ba786ab07edb.html"},{"by":"weinzierl","descendants":24,"id":23567005,"kids":[23568713,23571423,23569335,23570157,23567628,23570284],"score":126,"time":1592509377,"title":"FF Sandbox Escape","type":"story","url":"https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/06/ff-sandbox-escape-cve-2020-12388.html?m=1"},{"by":"lermontov","descendants":3,"id":23566986,"kids":[23571395,23573540],"score":21,"time":1592509293,"title":"Parisian Lives: Samuel Beckett, Simone de Beauvoir and Me – A Memoir","type":"story","url":"https://www.drb.ie/essays/the-hhard-life"},{"by":"edward","dead":true,"id":23566823,"kids":[23567272,23569150],"score":24,"time":1592508659,"title":"Californians must wear masks outside home under new state order","type":"story","url":"https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/Californians-must-wear-masks-outside-home-under-15350084.php"},{"by":"charles_f","descendants":20,"id":23566810,"kids":[23569087,23568777,23569221,23569531,23568672,23566876,23568720,23572013,23571925,23572016,23567214],"score":24,"time":1592508613,"title":"Teacher Tells Off Neil Armstrong for Faking the Moon Landing","type":"story","url":"https://kottke.org/20/06/teacher-tells-off-neil-armstrong-for-faking-the-moon-landing"},{"by":"rcarrigan87","dead":true,"id":23566433,"kids":[23567123,23566645,23567135],"score":36,"time":1592506855,"title":"How to buy or sell profitable online businesses privately","type":"story","url":"https://investors.club/"},{"by":"mrfusion","descendants":3,"id":23566191,"kids":[23566848,23568299],"score":1,"time":1592505555,"title":"The Good Guys Are Winning – AIER","type":"story","url":"https://www.aier.org/article/the-good-guys-are-winning/"},{"by":"Anon84","descendants":15,"id":23566172,"kids":[23566870,23568453,23568416,23567377,23569898,23567077,23570913],"score":123,"time":1592505461,"title":"Portugal finally recognises consul who saved thousands from Holocaust","type":"story","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53006790"},{"by":"navpatel","descendants":5,"id":23566110,"kids":[23566131,23570258,23566168],"score":2,"time":1592505102,"title":"Show HN: Yet Another Covid Map.

Hoping to find some advice and suggestions from people who did it successfully.<p>I&#x27;ve a bachelors in CS, and then recently graduated from Georgia Tech(OMSCS). I&#x27;ve been a Software Engineer and Team lead&#x2F;EM implementing  and consulting SaaS technologies for almost all of my 10 year career(SAP&#x2F;Salesforce&#x2F;Workday). The money is good, I work in one of the top 4 consulting  companies in the Silicon Valley. I&#x27;m just plain bored now and feel that my reason to get up in the morning doing the same kind of work and implementations is going down.<p>I&#x27;d want to get into something interesting next. I&#x27;m looking to do something in Python&#x2F;Go next, but I don&#x27;t know where&#x2F;how to start, looking to either get into Infrastructure (AWS&#x2F; Kubernetes&#x2F;GCP) or into Machine Learning. I&#x27;m trying to pick them up, and I&#x27;ve the following questions:<p>1.   How do I get started on these? There are just ton of things online, and i&#x27;m genuinely not sure where to start. Do I get a Data Science nanodegree&#x2F; How do I get started on K8&#x2F;AWS&#x2F;GCP?<p>2. How do you stick with them? Since I don&#x27;t get to use Python&#x2F;Go in my real life, since most of these SaaS implementations usually use vanilla JS, in some cases zython and the tools’ own scripting language, it&#x27;s very hard to &quot;use&quot; what I learn in step #1. How did you go about using it everyday?<p>3. If I&#x27;m able to somehow complete both 1 and 2, how do I pivot? Do I start off as an entry level engineer and go from there? I&#x27;m genuinely interested in how others did it, I do have a lot of experience in Software Architecture, Design Patterns, writing code as a discipline, reviewing code, version control etc., just not in the aforementioned areas.<p>It&#x27;s also important to mention that I&#x27;m originally from UK and on a work visa with a family here in the US, so maintaining a job(here in US) at least for the next couple years because of other family commitments(spouse is in Univ) and a kid is important.","time":1592453609,"title":"Ask HN: Pivoting Careers, How?","type":"story"},{"by":"funspectre","descendants":24,"id":23559680,"kids":[23560068,23562085,23560290,23561941,23561206,23562347,23560488],"score":78,"time":1592452683,"title":"PyPy: A Faster Python Implementation","type":"story","url":"https://www.pypy.org/index.html"},{"by":"codemonkeysh","descendants":2,"id":23559530,"kids":[23560106,23559578],"score":3,"text":"I&#x27;m looking for different pricing models by enterprise software companies like Atlassian&#x27;s JIRA, SalesForce, etc to learn about methods they employ.<p>e.g, Free Tier, Cheap Tier, Discounts based on users etc.<p>Any good examples?","time":1592450912,"title":"Ask HN: Enterprise SaaS Pricing Models?","type":"story"},{"by":"ILikeMathBetter","descendants":9,"id":23559296,"kids":[23562203,23560685,23560467,23559603,23560386],"score":7,"text":"I was wondering what are some of the more promising subfields within CSE and what are some good resources for further reading.","time":1592448402,"title":"Ask HN: What subfield within CS do you find most interesting?","type":"story"},{"by":"zeva","descendants":85,"id":23559258,"kids":[23560165,23560701,23559651,23559625,23559667,23560040,23559355,23560134,23560785,23560196,23559677,23561257,23560740,23560176,23559853,23560717,23560566,23560356,23560887,23560564,23560350,23559712,23562460,23562470],"score":69,"time":1592447941,"title":"State of Linux Desktop Security","type":"story","url":"https://bjornpagen.com/blog/linux-security"},{"by":"another","descendants":3,"id":23559197,"kids":[23559602,23562911,23559996,23559238],"score":4,"time":1592447342,"title":"Stop Sabotaging Your Career with Short Stints","type":"story","url":"https://staysaasy.com/engineering/2020/06/16/Stop-Sabotaging.html"},{"by":"princevegeta89","descendants":12,"id":23559108,"kids":[23566492,23567681,23562297],"score":19,"text":"Hi all,\nWanted to get insights from y&#x27;all on starting a company within the U.S. as an Indian immigrant on H1b who&#x27;s never going to land a green card through employment.<p>I work for one of the SV companies and have recently been serious about one of the ideas I have on my mind.

The risk I see here is that I only get to remain as a &quot;worker&quot; for the very company I founded who can be fired at any point for any reason or no reason. I have heard horror stories that happened to people in the past and I just cannot trust this path 100%.<p>- Move to Canada, the country that welcomes immigrants with arms wide open. I will be able to run my company with a GC there no problem. I am just slightly concerned about finding talent and VC access there. Shouldn&#x27;t be too much of a problem I guess though.<p>Has anyone of you been through a situation like this? what was your path?\nWhat risks did you have to take?

Not that I have any proof that this is indeed the plan, but their recent outage without any communication about it as well as the lack of communication on their issue tracker makes me think that the service is no longer actively maintained. Additionally claiming ETH bounties and withdrawing it has been impossible for a while now so they will basically keep all old, non moved ETH bounties after July 1st which nobody can claim.

Spent a lot time in the gym and took care about my nutrition. Now, i have a decent salary, a beautiful wife and probably everything that someone would describe as a pretty nice life. I can focus for 2 hours without a problem, burn 1000 calories in the gym within an hour and my life is pretty much optimized in terms of efficiency.<p>When i compare myself to what i was 10 year ago, i am pretty much ashamed of how much i was behind. And i wish that everyone could have such an improvement. If i could choose between 10 million dollars but being how i was 10 years ago and staying how i am today, i would always choose the version of today without a thought.<p>The problem that i have now, is that i get annoyed by all the inefficiencies others have. And when i try to help someone to get more efficient, i always see that they are too lazy to sacrifice a little of their comfort zone. Even my wife is lazy. She witnesses day by day how easily i go through life and how little issues i have. But she is not willing to improve or change herself much. I guess they are satisfied with their plateau. Most of my friends are nice and funny, but i can not have much interesting discussions with them. Event with the ones that hold PhD&#x27;s.<p>Does anyone has a similar experience?

The short timelines of these projects (averaged six weeks) coupled with the &quot;tech spike&quot; nature of the work gave me countless opportunities to experiment with different technologies and approaches to problem solving.

was fired shortly after WFH orders came into place in Canada, in large part because the lack of options for things to do made my job the overwhelming focus of the day and I lost the will to do the relatively menial developer tasks (building a website for a pdf based product using next.js) that were asked of me in a timely manner. I may have burnt out, I&#x27;m not sure. I&#x27;m not depressed, but I can&#x27;t bring myself to really be enthusiastic for any given thing I could apply to. I think this is in part fed by being burnt (and burnt out) in the past, the significant time and energy investment in getting a job, but also the somewhat dispensable nature of most companies and tech products. It all just strikes me as &quot;some tech crap that I&#x27;ll never see put to use&quot;. It&#x27;s tough to find a connection of any kind with the output of what is usually either quite dull intellectual work or very hard intellectual work.<p>The thought of assembling react apps for an arbitrary company is saddening and I can&#x27;t focus on something I&#x27;m not intrinsically interested in. Not that building websites is not interesting, but it seems like the output is often very mundane compared to how how arduous some frontend architectures have become.<p>By contrast, I can focus very well on sufficiently difficult and impactful projects, most likely where I have some control in the decisions made about the project. Likewise, I have no delusions that I&#x27;m some slept on PHD candidate that is too good for basic work. But I don&#x27;t really know where to go from here. Do I continue just sort of enjoying the summer like I have every other time I&#x27;ve left a job, perhaps spending my time on creating something or contributing to OS?<p>A good example of the previous, is that I was working on something I hadn&#x27;t before in a domain that I&#x27;d never touched. Specifically figuring out how to compress files and embed them as attachments in PDF documents in the PDF product that we were working on. It involved understanding zlib and hex file signatures and compression methods. That said, the rest of the job included customer service responses and random troubleshooting for customers who used the SDK, something that made me dread coming into work and something that they did not make clear during the hiring process.<p>Do you have any personal experiences like this you&#x27;d share?

There&#x27;s a dissonance that bugs me - and of course call out any ignorance or insularity here - but I really wish there were a purely graphical&#x2F;animated layer, with a semantic construction of sorts &quot;super-imposed&quot; on top to ensure accessibility and bot-digestible metadata.<p>Brings me to the title. Aside from wrapped text, this graphical layer could be pure SVG + CSS&amp;JS. Why constrain designers to little CSS hack triangles and circles when there&#x27;s an almost limitless vector graphics technology available instead?<p>I predict even with Houdini, CSS won&#x27;t be rich enough to eliminate presentational markup for complex web applications. I know about role=&quot;presentation&quot;, but that seems to be an awkward compromise to avoid an explicit separation of concerns:<p>&#x27;Inspect element&#x27; any sophisticated web app and you&#x27;ll see divs inside of divs inside of divs with class=&quot;color-blue border-2px border-gray background-number-seven&quot;. Slight exaggeration, but the separation of concerns doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>I know the spirit of the web is &quot;hackish&quot; in that the standard quo is more of a gradual, messy evolution that gets there eventually rather than giant leaps which may not &quot;stick the landing&quot;.

I don’t want to write novels, or read middle English texts, I would like to improve my speaking dramatically in the shortest time possible.","time":1592060419,"title":"Ask HN: How to learn English as a second language effectively","type":"story"},{"by":"tardismechanic","dead":true,"id":23509844,"kids":[23513003,23510173,23510246],"score":5,"time":1592060329,"title":"List of software name change requests to avoid being racist, sexist, bigoted","type":"story","url":"https://blog.yaymukund.com/posts/whats-in-a-name/"},{"by":"namanaggarwal","descendants":4,"id":23509729,"kids":[23513455,23509905],"score":4,"text":"I used to work for a company where it was a strict no no.

I would like to get started on the codebase quickly, but I also don&#x27;t want to incur the technical debt of a containerization retrofit.<p>So, HN readers, when do you containerize a new project?","time":1591984100,"title":"Ask HN: When do you containerize new projects?","type":"story"},{"by":"mariuz","descendants":7,"id":23501780,"kids":[23503499,23504357],"score":30,"time":1591984279,"title":"React Native's re-architecture in 2020","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/swlh/react-natives-re-architecture-in-2020-9bb82659792c"},{"by":"zackbrown","descendants":2,"id":23501644,"kids":[23502098,23501659],"score":5,"time":1591983397,"title":"Conway's Law","type":"story","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law"},{"by":"bluedevil2k","descendants":1,"id":23501632,"kids":[23502695,23501875],"score":2,"time":1591983321,"title":"Six years into reporting diversity, Big Tech has made little progress","type":"story","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/six-years-reporting-diversity-big-tech-has-made-little-progress-n1230461"},{"by":"Ashymad","descendants":84,"id":23501474,"kids":[23502964,23503312,23503062,23502965,23502777,23507270,23505277,23502566],"score":157,"time":1591982472,"title":"Forth implemented in Rust trait system","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/Ashymad/fortraith"},{"by":"gfloyd","descendants":44,"id":23501378,"kids":[23501389,23503391,23502721,23502498,23502764,23501903,23501744,23502176,23501797,23502189,23502502,23504318,23504011,23502006],"score":53,"time":1591981987,"title":"Show HN: ProsperStack – Use Stripe to automatically prevent cancellations","type":"story","url":"https://prosperstack.com/"},{"by":"mindfreeze","descendants":4,"id":23501403,"kids":[23506101,23503604,23501591,23503541],"score":13,"time":1591982101,"title":"The RuboCop Name Drama Redux","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/issues/8091"},{"by":"baylearn","descendants":57,"id":23501308,"kids":[23502199,23501322,23502271,23502137,23502165,23502625,23501964,23502188,23502245,23502143,23502601,23502343,23501953,23502161,23502345],"score":84,"time":1591981615,"title":"Senator Josh Hawley's Open Letter to Eric Yuan, CEO of Zoom","type":"story","url":"https://www.hawley.senate.gov/senator-hawley-zoom-pick-side-american-principles-and-free-speech-or-short-term-global-profits-and"},{"by":"notRobot","dead":true,"id":23501213,"kids":[23502726,23503425],"score":20,"time":1591981154,"title":"Business Hall of Bootlickers","type":"story","url":"https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/h7ghoc/zoom_says_china_asked_it_to_censor_prodemocracy/ful60lx/"},{"by":"askytb","descendants":362,"id":23501021,"kids":[23502379,23501664,23502031,23501648,23501527,23502124,23506814,23503674,23502556,23504138,23502145,23501613,23502012,23505528,23501831,23504028,23501558,23506792,23507160,23503258,23501706,23505731,23503796,23501792,23505587,23502485,23512703,23505074,23506365,23502391,23502125,23513579,23505336,23501733,23503368,23634024,23506855,23504378,23502075,23512331,23506406,23502306,23502367,23504184,23509246,23501533,23514500,23506761,23502374],"score":731,"time":1591980249,"title":"Biohacking Lite","type":"story","url":"https://karpathy.github.io/2020/06/11/biohacking-lite/"},{"by":"mfilion","descendants":8,"id":23500925,"kids":[23502538,23502935,23503354],"score":38,"time":1591979730,"title":"Generating MPEG-Dash Streams for Open Source Adaptive Streaming with GStreamer","type":"story","url":"https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/blog/2020/06/12/generating-mpeg-dash-streams-for-open-source-adaptive-streaming-with-gstreamer/"},{"by":"samdung","descendants":142,"id":23500769,"kids":[23501872,23501361,23501430,23501310,23501518,23503422,23501256,23502596,23502183,23502347,23513745,23526192,23501585,23501145,23503433,23501554,23502092,23503341,23501453,23504402,23501857,23504315,23504506,23508173,23501971,23503170,23505240,23507534,23501548],"score":262,"time":1591979016,"title":"Twilio Super Sim – Public Beta","type":"story","url":"https://www.twilio.com/docs/iot/supersim"},{"by":"mattboulos","descendants":3,"id":23500760,"kids":[23502115,23501380],"score":4,"text":"I really enjoy publications like the NY Review of Books and Times Literary Supplement.
