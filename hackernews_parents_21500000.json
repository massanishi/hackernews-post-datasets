But unfortunately I’m lacking the funds so I still need an income till I can properly develop it and I’m also hoping my next role can help me establish some networks.","time":1578499318,"title":"Ask HN: How do I find my ideal role?","type":"story"},{"by":"geek_at","descendants":170,"id":21992491,"kids":[21994753,21992901,21992785,21992770,21992824,21992928,21992769,21992893,21992724,21993574,21992799,21992859,22010215,21997875,21992874,21992867,21995691,21993344,21992798,21992894,21996775,21992871,21992758,21992775],"score":251,"time":1578499082,"title":"I opened a link some random person sent me and I got raided (2015)","type":"story","url":"https://blog.haschek.at/2015-that-not-so-awesome-time-the-police"},{"by":"black6","descendants":68,"id":21992499,"kids":[21993856,21993106,21993817,21992908,21998669,21997549,21997715,21993756,21998867,21997725,21996819],"score":164,"time":1578499122,"title":"Contractors use shell games to hide owners, cheat taxpayers","type":"story","url":"https://www.pogo.org/analysis/2019/12/contractors-use-shell-games-to-hide-owners-cheat-taxpayers/"},{"by":"jbegley","descendants":89,"id":21992349,"kids":[21993516,21993016,21993094,21993235,21994588,21993659,21993140,21992978,21993511,21993218,21993065],"score":62,"time":1578498159,"title":"Satellite Photos Reveal Extent of Damage from Iranian Strike on Air Base in Iraq","type":"story","url":"https://www.npr.org/2020/01/08/794517031/satellite-photos-reveal-extent-of-damage-at-al-assad-air-base"},{"by":"Tomte","descendants":83,"id":21992304,"kids":[21992599,21994212,21992622,21993147,21992630,21993955,21992581,21992645,21993269,21992435,21992694,21993558,21994845,21992856,21993868,21992589,21994614,21996374,21992409,21993351,21994767,21996335],"score":197,"time":1578497931,"title":"The Best Hike in Every State (2019)","type":"story","url":"https://www.outsideonline.com/2393036/50-best-hikes-us"},{"by":"georgecmu","descendants":2,"id":21992414,"kids":[21992721,21992740],"score":10,"time":1578498548,"title":"1950s U.S. Nuclear Target List Offers Chilling Insight","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/23/us/politics/1950s-us-nuclear-target-list-offers-chilling-insight.html"},{"by":"ozdave","descendants":4,"id":21992253,"kids":[21996302,21996240,21996713],"score":27,"time":1578497697,"title":"A lazy fix 20 years ago means the Y2K bug is taking down computers now","type":"story","url":"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2229238-a-lazy-fix-20-years-ago-means-the-y2k-bug-is-taking-down-computers-now/"},{"by":"sharkov007","descendants":2,"id":21992212,"kids":[21993429,21992446],"score":1,"time":1578497355,"title":"Pentagram, Amazon of banking or how to switch banks like napkins","type":"story","url":"http://pentagraminsider.com/"},{"by":"forgingahead","descendants":2,"id":21992134,"kids":[21992634,21992182],"score":3,"time":1578496751,"title":"Carlos Ghosn Berates Japan, Nissan Executives in First Public Comments","type":"story","url":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/carlos-ghosn-set-to-tell-his-side-of-the-story-11578472943"},{"by":"astigsen","descendants":146,"id":21992062,"kids":[21992252,21994255,21992744,21993034,21992633,21992381,21992773,21992417,21992254,21992421,21992415],"score":127,"time":1578496159,"title":"Finland is the only EU country where homelessness is in decline","type":"story","url":"https://scoop.me/housing-first-finland-homelessness/"},{"by":"smaddock","descendants":10,"id":21992050,"kids":[21993722,21993878,22012872],"score":47,"time":1578496095,"title":"The End of Indie Web Browsers: You Can (Not) Compete","type":"story","url":"https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/posts/the-end-of-indie-web-browsers/"},{"by":"dsgerard","descendants":22,"id":21992104,"kids":[21992336,21992248,21992243,21992211,21992591,21992264,21992263,21993195,21992373,21992275,21992244,21992258],"score":48,"time":1578496482,"title":"Finland’s Prime Minister Calls for Debate on 4-Day Work Week","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-08/finland-s-millennial-pm-calls-for-debate-on-4-day-work-week"},{"by":"pat-jay","descendants":11,"id":21991926,"kids":[21992133,21992891,21992883],"score":66,"time":1578495231,"title":"The boring findings from scraping the top 100 e-commerce stores using Shopify","type":"story","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/elckkv/i_scraped_the_top_100_ecommerce_stores_using/"},{"by":"michaelbuckbee","descendants":4,"id":21991866,"kids":[21992060,21994174,21993256,21992101],"score":115,"time":1578494826,"title":"API Security Best Practices","type":"story","url":"https://expeditedsecurity.com/api-security-best-practices-megaguide/"},{"by":"Takizawa","descendants":2,"id":21991731,"kids":[21992544,21991873],"score":1,"text":"I love the idea of a consistent morning routine prior to the workday.

everyone!<p>We’re Fitz &amp; Malis, the founders of Freshpaint (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freshpaint.io&#x2F;). We make it dead simple to collect data from your site and implement tools in a single click and without code.<p>With our Autotrack javascript, Freshpaint automatically instruments your site. Then you can use our point-and-click interface to visually create events after the fact, and send that historical data to any of your analytics or marketing tools.<p>Customer data powers nearly the entire analytics, growth, and marketing stacks of today’s B2C and B2B businesses. But what’s crazy is that customer data is captured and managed using technology that is literally over 25 years old: Let’s say you want to see how many users clicked your signup button or played a song. Or you want to take the users who added an item to their cart and engage them in a marketing campaign. You have to manually write code for each and every event to capture and log that behavior. Then you have to send to it your marketing and analytics tools.<p>Segment is great because it allows you to collect data once and send it to a bunch of different tools, but Segment is still built on legacy technology. It still requires a massive engineering effort to stand up and maintain. Just last week someone told us that at unicorn-level grocery delivery company, it takes 2-3 extra weeks to ship anything because of this tax.<p>Freshpaint automates the challenges here so that engineering can focus on building product, implementations can be done in minutes not weeks or days, and you can make your stack work for you instead of the other way around.<p>We were inspired by a phenomenon we saw while working with customers as early Heap employees. We saw that lots of customers loved Heap for product analytics, but that was only a small slice of the stack. Across analytics, product, and marketing it’s common to see a dozen other tools that require customer data. We kept seeing the same data pipelines and integrations built using the legacy approach of manual code.<p>We built Freshpaint to instrument your entire site and hook up your stack in just a few clicks, without having to write any code.<p>How it works:<p>1. Install Freshpaint’s Autotrack snippet on your site. It takes 60 seconds, and from that point Freshpaint collects every click, pageview, etc.<p>2. Connect over 70 destinations like Google Analytics, Amplitude, Hubspot, Fullstory, Intercom, and a data warehouse. This is done by copying and pasting an API key or account ID. See our integrations here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freshpaint.io&#x2F;integrations<p>3. Create events in Freshpaint. Our UI provides a point-and-click way of creating events. Data is retroactively available back to the day you installed Freshpaint, regardless of when the event is created.<p>4. Send data to any destination in one click. You can even backfill historical data.<p>5. Use all that time you saved to ship something new, build an awesome feature you can upsell, or plot your next marketing campaign to take over the world.<p>Great technology is not just about product. We commonly hear from Segment users that it’s really expensive for what you actually get. Search HN and you’ll see tons of complaints and even horror stories about their pricing like this comment here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19221872. With all the work that’s required after you purchase, we agree! On top of automating all that work, our pricing is designed to be much more friendly.<p>We look forward to feedback from the HN community!","time":1578345630,"title":"Launch HN: Freshpaint (YC S19) – Automated, Retroactive Alternative to Segment","type":"story"},{"by":"mgh2","descendants":62,"id":21973814,"kids":[21974300,21974440,21974274,21974381,21974341,21974493,21974859,21974475,21974459,21974571,21974382,21976685,21973902,21974394,21977312,21974398,21974235],"score":60,"time":1578347664,"title":"‘Buffett Indicator’ Warns Stocks Doomed for Worse Crash Than 2008","type":"story","url":"https://www.ccn.com/buffett-indicator-warns-stocks-doomed-worse-crash-than-2008/"},{"by":"unwiredben","descendants":27,"id":21973823,"kids":[21974562,21974218,21974856,21980140,21974372,21974434,21974103,21974161],"score":66,"time":1578347693,"title":"Media.ccc.de in Roku Channel Store","type":"story","url":"https://channelstore.roku.com/details/567876/media.ccc.de"},{"by":"ilamont","descendants":244,"id":21973333,"kids":[21973817,21973854,21974436,21974176,21973688,21973694,21973867,21973705,21974304,21974474,21974464,21974111,21974397,21973966,21976448,21975604,21973764,21974045,21974094,21973605,21973754,21974125,21975029,21973773,21973628,21974129,21973908],"score":209,"time":1578344872,"title":"California Sues Vinod Khosla over Martins Beach Public Access","type":"story","url":"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-06/martins-beach-california-lawsuit"},{"by":"bryanrasmussen","descendants":20,"id":21973293,"kids":[21973798,21973811,21975279,21976651],"score":118,"time":1578344647,"title":"Pre-Inca canal system uses hillsides as sponges to store water","type":"story","url":"https://eos.org/articles/pre-inca-canal-system-uses-hillsides-as-sponges-to-store-water"},{"by":"Four8Five","descendants":4,"id":21973201,"kids":[21973625,21973317],"score":7,"time":1578344106,"title":"Ask HN: Experience Using Stripe Atlas to Incorporate","type":"story"},{"by":"awb","descendants":18,"id":21973146,"kids":[21976355,21977032,21973883,21975455,21986611],"score":33,"time":1578343779,"title":"$1B solar plant was obsolete before it went online","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-06/a-1-billion-solar-plant-was-obsolete-before-it-ever-went-online"},{"by":"vinnyglennon","descendants":14,"id":21973148,"kids":[21975070,21977584,21978955,21980730,21988116],"score":87,"time":1578343788,"title":"The propeller is giving way to the pump-jet propulsor on larger submarines","type":"story","url":"https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/31708/veteran-sonarman-explains-why-pump-jets-are-superior-to-props-on-modern-submarines"},{"by":"feross","descendants":43,"id":21973060,"kids":[22002056,21999808,22000102,22001679,22003526,22000786,22002119,22001811],"score":102,"time":1578343309,"title":"A Hidden Cost of Ransomware: Wholesale Password Theft","type":"story","url":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/01/the-hidden-cost-of-ransomware-wholesale-password-theft/"},{"by":"ilamont","descendants":175,"id":21972836,"kids":[21973326,21973411,21974392,21975241,21974016,21974003,21975970,21973446,21973815,21973627,21976252,21974489,21975118,21977216,21976331,21973898,21974279,21975294,21973461,21974093,21973409],"score":270,"time":1578342040,"title":"A harassment campaign on Goodreads","type":"story","url":"https://www.patreon.com/posts/32921860"},{"by":"throw51319","descendants":54,"id":21972807,"kids":[21974778,21974146,21973054,21974187,21973318,21974418,21974220,21975615,21973839,21974113,21974785,21973518,21975695,21974535,21974317,21974224,21975495,21974678],"score":23,"text":"I&#x27;ve decided to do a &quot;dry&quot; January and if I can do it, will try to extent to all of 2020.<p>I didn&#x27;t drink often, not more than once a week.

To typeset the book, I used the R bookdown package by Yihui Xie to translate my markdown into a PDF format. I also used Google docs to edit drafts and check for typos.

have read less than 50 books in my life and probably less than 5 books in the past 10 years.<p>Growing up with the Internet, I always assumed that everything could be found for free online.<p>I spend most of my day reading online articles&#x2F;conversations, watching videos, and listening to podcasts. I have thousands of non-fiction (mostly self-improvement) books in my reading list on GoodReads, but almost never bother to read any. I assume that the best part of the best books will surface in daily conversations, YouTube videos, CliffsNotes, podcasts, Reddit posts&#x2F;comments, blog articles, etc. I even find myself reading the comments and not reading the article most of the time. I&#x27;m fine with bullet point style summaries and don&#x27;t care much about the fluff that fills most books I&#x27;ve read in the past.<p>Up until recently, I didn&#x27;t think I was missing out. I thought that online content was roughly equivalent to 80% of what I&#x27;d get from reading actual books for 20% of the effort. I also thought that most books probably don&#x27;t age very well and that most of the bleeding edge stuff could only be found online. But I&#x27;m starting to wonder if that&#x27;s true. I&#x27;m starting to see people online mention that books are infinitely better than online content. I read that millionaires and billionaires read tons of books. I wonder if I&#x27;m missing out?<p>One issue for me is that books are a very big time investment. I read very slowly and I don&#x27;t remember everything I read either. The last few books I read were mostly filled with fluff, anecdotes, stories, jokes, and trivialities. Even if I wanted to read books, I just don&#x27;t know which ones I should start with, out of the 1000 &quot;must-read&quot; books in my reading list.<p>Are books worth it? Is it more true for some fields than others? Is it more true for older books? Isn&#x27;t most of the information from books freely available online? Am I missing out?","time":1578150657,"title":"Ask HN: Are books worth it?","type":"story"},{"by":"infodocket","descendants":15,"id":21955246,"kids":[21956721,21956447,21958451],"score":76,"time":1578150537,"title":"SAR Imagery Reveals Presence of Concealed Sub at North Korea’s Sinpo Naval Base","type":"story","url":"https://www.38north.org/2020/01/sinpo010320/"},{"by":"pseudolus","descendants":3,"id":21955254,"kids":[21955674,21955935,21955622,21955727],"score":7,"time":1578150612,"title":"Author pinpoints racism in science: Naive scientists plus strategic racists","type":"story","url":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/01/why-racism-in-science-never-really-went-away/"},{"by":"kuobouchen","descendants":4,"id":21955176,"kids":[21955214,21955478,21959250],"score":6,"time":1578149885,"title":"Show HN: Anonymous job board to help you quit on good terms","type":"story","url":"https://www.leaveongoodterms.com/"},{"by":"wslh","descendants":3,"id":21955195,"kids":[21955387,21955853,21955375,21955761],"score":17,"time":1578150064,"title":"Jean-Michel Basquiat's Resume","type":"story","url":"https://jackbrummet.blogspot.com/2014/02/jean-michel-basquiats-resume.html"},{"by":"keiferski","descendants":59,"id":21954987,"kids":[21955267,21955541,21955166,21955284,21956001,21955388,21955294,21955800,21955673,21957385,21955345,21955735,21955190],"score":45,"time":1578147483,"title":"The Western Canon by Harold Bloom (2011)","type":"story","url":"http://sonic.net/~rteeter/grtbloom.html"},{"by":"ddevault","descendants":133,"id":21954886,"kids":[21955102,21958292,21957476,21957993,21958733,21957662,21958221,21958285,21957181,21958886,21960212,21957461,21956238,21959585,21959789,21957885,21958939,21960217,21960379,21957388,21955838,21958467,21960717,21955929,21957814,21958565,21958899,21958703,21958657,21960706,21958642],"score":212,"time":1578145989,"title":"Hello World","type":"story","url":"https://drewdevault.com/2020/01/04/Slow.html"},{"by":"ArtWomb","descendants":2,"id":21954847,"kids":[21962501,21957145],"score":16,"time":1578145486,"title":"Synthetic Modelling of Biological Communication [pdf]","type":"story","url":"https://wpmedia.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/13/2018/12/27-3-5.pdf"},{"by":"meadhikari","descendants":3,"id":21954849,"kids":[21956403,21963588,21956078],"score":1,"text":"Hi all,<p>First a little background about me, I am a software engineer by education and currently am leading a team of 20 passionate engineers mainly focused on cloud consulting in AWS.<p>Blockchain has always been a fascinating subject for me and I believe it will be just as impactful this decade as the internet was in the last.<p>To get in-depth knowledge of blockchain, I explored Hyperledger Fabric and got to the point where I can create a supply chain hello world application of my own.<p>My question is how can I capitalize on knowing the fact that blockchain is going to be huge?

Is the world&#x27;s next Berlin Wall destined to be digital?<p>Consider the following excerpts from a Nov. 2019 speech given by Ian Bremmer [5]:<p>&quot;[The global market for data and information] is breaking in two. It is no longer global. In the beginning, the internet—the Worldwide Web—was driven by a single set of standards and rules. With very few exceptions, one consumer had virtually the same access as another. No longer.&quot;<p>&quot;Today, China and the United States are building two distinct online ecosystems. That&#x27;s true for the transformation of today&#x27;s internet, but also for the construction of the new internet of things. The American tech ecosystem, with all its strengths and shortcomings, is built by the private sector and (loosely) regulated by the government. The Chinese system is dominated by the state. That&#x27;s also true for big data collection, for development of artificial intelligence, for the rollout of 5G cellular network technology, and for defense and retaliation against cyberattacks.&quot;<p>&quot;This leaves us with a big question: Where exactly will the new Berlin Wall stand? Where will we find the boundary between one technological system and the other? Will Europe align with the United States? Or will the EU fragment into individual decisions within individual European countries? How will India position itself? And South Korea? And Brazil? What pressures will even Japan face?&quot;<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnet.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;chinas-national-intranet&#x2F;<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theregister.co.uk&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;12&#x2F;russia_disconnect_internet_intranet&#x2F;<p>[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;technology-50902496<p>[4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;26&#x2F;russia-starts-testing-its-own-internal-internet&#x2F;<p>[5] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eurasiagroup.net&#x2F;live-post&#x2F;end-of-american-order-ian-bremmer-2019-gzero-summit-speech","time":1578102963,"title":"Ask HN: Will the next Berlin Wall be digital?","type":"story"},{"by":"vo2maxer","descendants":3,"id":21951850,"kids":[21952579,21952157],"score":6,"time":1578098031,"title":"How to Be Healthy, in Just 48 Words","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/03/opinion/simple-health-advice.html"},{"by":"Sean-Der","descendants":47,"id":21951692,"kids":[21951981,21952222,21952740,21952887,21952434,21960731,21952336,21952145,21959418,21955009,21952273,21954542,21956071,21952353,21952217],"score":251,"time":1578096332,"title":"Show HN: Pure C WebRTC implementation for embedded devices","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-webrtc-sdk-c"},{"by":"mplanchard","descendants":19,"id":21951679,"kids":[21953082,21952547,21952624,21953811,21952895,21952295],"score":187,"time":1578096211,"title":"Scripting tmux","type":"story","url":"https://www.arp242.net/tmux.html"},{"by":"maxan","descendants":2,"id":21951676,"kids":[21952817,21951867],"score":3,"text":"What has your experience been?<p>PS I know that Chase is more of an SMB bank that doesn&#x27;t seem to tailor their services specifically to startups but I like the fact that it consistently ranks high on customer satisfaction rankings — while others aren&#x27;t even on the list.

These numbers are a rough estimate. Focus on what we are after here, not the average coffee drinker cup size per se.<p>If our sole purpose of drinking coffee were for ingesting caffeine, we are not being as efficient as we could be. Caffeine tablets are on the market. Here is what I found at my local grocery store:<p>Product: box of caffeine tablets - 40 count<p>Caffeine amount per tablet: 200mg<p>Total price: $8.29 USD<p>Price per tablet: $0.21 USD<p>If our sole goal here is caffeine intake, we just now found an alternative for caffeine ingestion for $0.21 USD per 200mg of caffeine, or one tablet in this case. Now we are being more efficient.<p>Now think of all of your typical morning interactions where you and others may be drinking coffee and replace that mental visual with all of you ingesting caffeine tablets instead. That picture does not look right to me. It would be and feel weird, would it not?<p>So why do we really drink coffee? Is it more than just for caffeine? It is for social acceptance?

You can even auto-repeat them.<p>- No community-entered foods. This is a feature in most cases. Food is from a professionally curated database (Nutritionix) or custom foods you enter. Most community entered-food in other apps is flat out wrong. Once I figure out a proper ranking &#x2F; vetting mechanism, I may introduce a comparable feature.","time":1577902568,"title":"Show HN: Joy – a privacy-first, ad-free nutrition tracker for pragmatic types","type":"story"},{"by":"gabcoh","descendants":2,"id":21929471,"kids":[21929696,21929590],"score":6,"time":1577902408,"title":"Bill Gates: What I’m Thinking about This New Year’s Eve","type":"story","url":"https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Year-in-Review-2019"},{"by":"alexclear","descendants":69,"id":21929297,"kids":[21931056,21931617,21931698,21932222,21931816,21939216,21932238,21932159,21932174],"score":104,"time":1577901134,"title":"Reiser5","type":"story","url":"https://marc.info/?l=reiserfs-devel&m=157780043509663&w=2"},{"by":"datashow","descendants":19,"id":21929173,"kids":[21929870,21929514,21929412,21932741,21929540,21929914],"score":20,"time":1577900201,"title":"Biden to Coal Miners: Learn to Code","type":"story","url":"https://gizmodo.com/biden-to-coal-miners-learn-to-code-1840735758"},{"by":"pcr910303","descendants":74,"id":21929063,"kids":[21932963,21933388,21930512,21936569,21933002,21933383,21932252,21936468,21935396,21934337,21933253,21933862,21938139,21931770,21935830,21935573,21936890,21934986,21930553,21932857,21977126,21933637,21933440,21936956,21935408,21933550,21930287,21935754],"score":77,"time":1577899284,"title":"Chronologic Versioning: No more arbitrary version updates and regressions","type":"story","url":"https://chronver.org"},{"by":"mrep","descendants":10,"id":21928981,"kids":[21929614,21929712,21929409,21930721,21929521],"score":16,"time":1577898356,"title":"Goldman Sachs is saying the economy is nearly recession-proof","type":"story","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/31/goldman-sachs-is-saying-the-economy-is-nearly-recession-proof.html"},{"by":"mirimir","descendants":67,"id":21928934,"kids":[21928942,21932038,21932631,21932514,21932389],"score":94,"time":1577897981,"title":"Lies vs. Statistics: VPN Virtual Server Locations","type":"story","url":"https://restoreprivacy.com/virtual-server-locations/"},{"by":"olivermarks","descendants":3,"id":21928849,"kids":[21928898,21929804],"score":14,"time":1577897140,"title":"China Is Building Enormous Self-Sustaining Cities All over the African Continent","type":"story","url":"http://themostimportantnews.com/archives/the-takeover-china-is-building-enormous-self-sustaining-chinese-cities-all-over-the-african-continent"},{"by":"perakojotgenije","descendants":162,"id":21928831,"kids":[21929174,21929258,21929881,21933632,21929581,21930597,21932590,21929478,21930119,21929776,21932961,21929475,21929483,21929528,21930450,21930973,21931471,21929553,21934033,21930482,21932611,21931965,21929869,21930044,21930037],"score":435,"time":1577896963,"title":"Godot Engine – A decade in retrospective and future","type":"story","url":"https://godotengine.org/article/retrospective-and-future"},{"by":"gz5","descendants":650,"id":21928734,"kids":[21929224,21930478,21932005,21929906,21929300,21929067,21929392,21930585,21929662,21929134,21929432,21930359,21929163,21931835,21930999,21930154,21930224,21929187,21931532,21929031,21928785,21929098,21929552,21929105,21931111,21931944,21929055,21929921,21931720,21932153,21930100,21930557,21931177,21932028,21931561,21930574,21932798,21929215,21929539,21933230,21931706,21930033,21934006,21931785,21939232,21930315,21936961,21930608,21929782,21932216,21940904,21931257,21931797,21930619,21932156,21930237,21930144,21930805,21933358,21933374,21930774,21930677,21934672,21932318,21935933,21929451,21931946,21929033,21932180,21932178,21929862,21932230,21933911,21930422,21933693,21929154,21938830,21932414,21932453,21931419,21933732,21932405,21929041,21929024,21941079,21933069,21929022,21929051,21929202,21931445,21932054,21933963,21932521,21931373,21928973,21930270,21929333,21929083,21929306,21929090,21929160],"score":462,"time":1577896182,"title":"What Will Happen in the 2020s","type":"story","url":"https://avc.com/2020/01/what-will-happen-in-the-2020s/"},{"by":"martyalain","descendants":2,"id":21928673,"kids":[21928740,21929040],"score":2,"text":"Dear HN folk,<p>I wish you success with your personal projects and of course the best possible health.<p>Concerning the lambda way project, whatever introduction I make:<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lambdaway.free.fr&#x2F;<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lambdaway.free.fr&#x2F;lambdaspeech&#x2F;?view=whitepage<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lambdaway.free.fr&#x2F;lambdaspeech&#x2F;?view=lambda<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lambdaway.free.fr&#x2F;lambdaspeech&#x2F;?view=prime_pattern  and following…<p>time has gone by … and I must come to the conclusion that my interests (expressed in the lambdaway project) are far off the radars of HN folks, among others.

Instead I handed the reins over to the team that was in place, and got a tech job, where I am pretty happy and well paid.  I spend 10-20 hours a week on nights and weekends managing the business.<p>Since it was my own company, I took on some debt and liability to get it going, and I still backstop any financial problems.

In this case I&#x27;m referring more specifically to the academic superstars rather than, say, athletic superstars.<p>At my high school there were a large number of academic superstars. These were people who routinely placed first in national and international competitions, were class presidents, had perfect GPA&#x27;s and standardized test scores, were Rhodes Scholars, and went on to gain admission to coveted colleges like Harvard&#x2F;Yale&#x2F;Stanford&#x2F;MIT. The fierce competition was encouraged by teachers and parents alike. The superstar students complied with the demand -- these were highly motivated, extremely hardworking and talented individuals. The consensus was that, as a result of their early impressive achievements, they were destined for great things later in life.<p>In hindsight, those traits and accomplishments were not a predictor for future success. Looking back at those high school superstars specifically, their careers in the present day range from university fundraiser to eye doctor to management consultant to employee at a large company. All respectable careers for sure. Yet, in no case does it seem like the person benefited from the work they put in during high school to distinguish themselves. In other words, their present-day careers would have been just as achievable if they had been regular high school students without distinctions.<p>The message was so clear: If you do this, you get X, where X is defined as some combination of the perfect job, the perfect career, great personal satisfaction, the admiration of your peers, and so on.<p>Why is this fable of early achievement as a predictor for future success preached so consistently in our society, when there is little evidence to support it?","time":1577674512,"title":"High School Fizzle Syndrome – Predicting Future Success","type":"story"},{"by":"patrickdevivo","descendants":295,"id":21910391,"kids":[21911183,21910478,21915011,21910445,21910433,21910456,21910622,21910686,21910470,21911279,21910474,21910591,21915207,21910562,21912826,21912282,21914266,21911144,21912383,21913228,21910599,21914270,21910840,21912681,21911716,21910870,21917074,21911124,21911742,21910513,21913543,21911012,21912523,21912468,21915534,21910936,21911187,21912843,21910837,21912839,21911833,21913209,21913094,21910459,21912436,21912539,21910992,21911188,21910860,21910662,21912781,21911789],"score":436,"time":1577674281,"title":"The Linux codebase has over 3k TODO comments, many from over a decade ago","type":"story","url":"https://todos.tickgit.com/browse?repo=https://github.com/torvalds/linux"},{"by":"signa11","descendants":31,"id":21909990,"kids":[21911089,21911118,21911115,21911700,21911195,21911449,21911312,21918847],"score":72,"time":1577669169,"title":"The unreasonable effectiveness of one-on-ones","type":"story","url":"https://www.benkuhn.net/11"},{"by":"jelliclesfarm","descendants":159,"id":21909968,"kids":[21910145,21910118,21910091,21910152,21910193,21910182,21910100,21910371,21910150,21910338,21910164,21910179,21910298,21910147,21910159,21910310,21910208,21913868,21910190,21911608,21910339,21910170,21910120],"score":138,"time":1577668955,"title":"I’m on Medicare, but I still got stuck with a $25k hospital bill","type":"story","url":"https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2019/dec/27/andrew-taylor-im-on-medicare-but-i-still-got-stuck/"},{"by":"smacktoward","descendants":5,"id":21909914,"kids":[21910704,21910605,21910848,21915364,21910680],"score":11,"time":1577668283,"title":"Joe Rogan’s Galaxy Brain","type":"story","url":"https://slate.com/culture/2019/03/joe-rogans-podcast-is-an-essential-platform-for-freethinkers-who-hate-the-left.html"},{"by":"prismatic","descendants":3,"id":21909916,"kids":[21919537,21920108,21917263],"score":35,"time":1577668297,"title":"The Unpredictable Cactus","type":"story","url":"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v42/n01/emily-witt/the-unpredictable-cactus"},{"by":"dbieber","descendants":4,"id":21909891,"kids":[21911992,21913395,21910640],"score":10,"time":1577667790,"title":"Show HN: Keeping Track of My Life in a Spreadsheet","type":"story","url":"https://davidbieber.com/post/2019-12-29-track-your-life-in-a-spreadsheet/"},{"by":"p4bl0","descendants":6,"id":21909694,"kids":[21914694,21915390,21914513],"score":43,"time":1577665458,"title":"Why Games for AI?","type":"story","url":"http://www.abiaryan.com/why-games-for-ai/"},{"by":"syllable_studio","descendants":3,"id":21909525,"kids":[21911637,21909656,21911643],"score":2,"time":1577663644,"title":"Giant Concentric Circles in Granite Springs Valley, NV","type":"story","url":"https://www.blackrockdesert.org/wiki/index.php?title=Granite_Springs_Valley"},{"by":"kick","descendants":56,"id":21909497,"kids":[21910345,21910659,21910642,21910929,21910111,21911016,21912239,21910683,21910462,21913792,21911218,21919387,21910628,21910319],"score":151,"time":1577663389,"title":"Principles of the American Cargo Cult (2003)","type":"story","url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20030812081806/http://klausler.com/cargo.html"},{"by":"lelf","descendants":67,"id":21909445,"kids":[21913380,21912637,21912387,21915783,21915224,21912509,21911750,21912785,21911978,21912275],"score":176,"time":1577662774,"title":"The Central Limit Theorem and Its Misuse","type":"story","url":"https://lambdaclass.com/data_etudes/central_limit_theorem_misuse/"},{"by":"jseliger","descendants":149,"id":21909364,"kids":[21910673,21910464,21910488,21910230,21909438,21909742,21913417,21911302,21909646,21909986,21911440,21910649,21909655,21910989,21915471,21919207],"score":269,"time":1577661844,"title":"The StingRay Is Why the 4th Amendment Was Written (2017)","type":"story","url":"https://fee.org/articles/the-stingray-is-exactly-why-the-4th-amendment-was-written/"},{"by":"coachdarek","descendants":3,"id":21909210,"kids":[21910062,21909259],"score":1,"text":"Hi HackerNews.

I spent 13 years working professionally in companies of all kinds and sizes in several countries.<p>Four years ago I met a woman with whom I decided to start a family. We ended up in a tiny village in Northern Germany next to her family, with VERY limited options for work. As a result, we lived mostly on welfare and I focused on designing the programming language I always wanted [0] [1] [2]. I setup a Liberapay account [3], but never received any donations. Then disaster struck; and my partner&#x27;s family decided that since I still wasn&#x27;t supporting the family, I needed to leave pronto.<p>So I ended up on the street with everything I owned in a bag and around €250; and no passport since I didn&#x27;t need one when I got there and spending €150 on welfare wasn&#x27;t an option. So got a temporary passport and headed South to Riace&#x2F;Italy; where I was hoping to be able to arrange a simple life and get time to process.<p>I&#x27;ve now spent two months in Riace, and come to the conclusion that there is no future for me here. The first month I was able to find work harvesting olives, which paid €20 per day. And for the last month, I&#x27;ve been living with a family of African immigrants who kindly offered me a bed and food for free once they learned of my situation.<p>I have received enough donations on my Gofundme campaign [4] to renew the passport and make the trip back, but could really use a buffer.

is the next evolution of social media apps?<p>2020—it’s a year that, because of its symmetrical numerology, tends to attract a disproportionate share of futurist musings.<p>According to my research, I found that social media usage will continue to grow. 1 million new people joined social networks every single day in 2017. And nearly a quarter of a billion new users came online for the first time in 2017. This growth will continue—and we’ll see interesting uses of social media come from Africa which currently has the fastest growth rates, with the number of internet users across the continent increasing by more than 20 percent year-over-year.<p>These are my predictions:<p>1) Gen Z drives VR and AR adoption<p>By 2020, we’ll see more practical uses of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) in marketing. Amazon, for example, are exploring how to use AR to help consumers to try on virtual clothes and explore products. Snapchat’s Geofilters and Lens functions have been broadly adopted in marketing campaigns including creating location-specific videos to influence nearby customers such as event attendees or pedestrians near a store location.<p>2) Social for product research<p>For online product research, search still leads the way. But social is catching up.<p>3) Passive networking<p>Globally, online consumers spend one-third of their time on social media. But as people spend more time on social, we’re seeing new behaviors emerge.<p>People are sharing less personal information on major networks. Instead, they’re watching videos, killing time, and sharing things to connect with friends.<p>4) Turning those followers&#x2F;fans into IRL friends<p>(http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hangout.landen.co&#x2F;) I&#x27;m working on this, your feedback is appreciated<p>What are your thoughts on social next evolution?","time":1577194180,"title":"Next Evolution of Social Media","type":"story"},{"by":"sharingiscaring","dead":true,"id":21871876,"kids":[21872228,21873533],"score":5,"time":1577194116,"title":"Scammers Use Trump to Sell Fake Pills and Take Your Money","type":"story","url":"https://guard.io/blog/how-scammers-use-trump-to-sell-fake-pills-and-take-your-money"},{"by":"DyslexicAtheist","descendants":51,"id":21871780,"kids":[21885647,21885662,21885623,21886122,21886560,21885847,21889169,21886358,21888279,21886073,21889761,21886306,21889763,21887762,21885410,21886993,21887967,21885573],"score":293,"time":1577193089,"title":"LaTeX, Instantly: Extract LaTeX from PDFs or Handwritten Notes","type":"story","url":"https://mathpix.com/"},{"by":"jonluca","descendants":50,"id":21871796,"kids":[21872316,21872079,21872104,21871946,21873656,21874499,21872044,21871959,21872277,21871951],"score":109,"time":1577193324,"title":"Flight stats, entertainment, and trying to crack Widevine","type":"story","url":"https://blog.jonlu.ca/posts/aa-tracker"},{"by":"DyslexicAtheist","descendants":36,"id":21871701,"kids":[21876962,21877592,21876677,21876758,21876652,21879551,21881675,21876870,21877142,21877259],"score":106,"time":1577192145,"title":"The investigation into ToTok","type":"story","url":"https://objective-see.com/blog/blog_0x52.html"},{"by":"robfig","descendants":178,"id":21871645,"kids":[21871668,21874489,21872467,21872744,21873611,21871898,21874252,21875775,21872496,21874543,21875899,21875743,21872474,21878993,21874350,21875683,21873269,21873101,21874340,21872729],"score":175,"time":1577191433,"title":"Java JIT vs. Java AOT vs. Go for Small, Short-Lived Processes","type":"story","url":"http://macias.info/entry/201912201300_graal_aot.md"},{"by":"dnetesn","descendants":5,"id":21871862,"kids":[21872826,21872519],"score":43,"time":1577193956,"title":"New discoveries set to reveal the geology of planets outside our solar system","type":"story","url":"https://phys.org/news/2019-12-discoveries-reveal-geology-planets-solar.html"},{"by":"jhabdas","descendants":8,"id":21871584,"kids":[21878811,21879375,21879619,21878658,21878387],"score":30,"time":1577190802,"title":"Invisible Arch Linux","type":"story","url":"https://habd.as/post/invisible-arch-linux/"},{"by":"DyslexicAtheist","descendants":2,"id":21871569,"kids":[21872643,21872997],"score":28,"time":1577190664,"title":"China slammed over programme that 'appoints' men to sleep with Uighur women","type":"story","url":"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=12295956"},{"by":"wimagguc","descendants":2,"id":21871567,"kids":[21871660,21875615],"score":3,"time":1577190648,"title":"It Is 2019.

HN! We’re Esteban and Juan, co-founders of MegaBoost. Check us out at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;megaboost.io&#x2F;<p>We have built MegaBoost because we identified that the most painful part of a B2B sales process is the very first step: Obtaining high-quality leads. When we had our previous startup, I was taking at least 8 hours to build a high-quality 100 contact email list. That’s why we decided to automate this. We’re now being used by YC companies.<p>Our previous startup was in enterprise cybersecurity, and actually won a Pioneer tournament thanks to that.<p>We are different from Hunter, Clearbit Connect, etc. because:<p>1. We give you all the data needed to send customized messages at scale, which is what increases your campaign’s response rate. Unlike our competition we don’t just give you their email, company, and name; we also give you the person’s position and even a customized ice breaker.<p>2. We only include verified emails on our campaigns, and can verify them with a 98% accuracy. You won’t be sending emails to a catch-all address.<p>3. We do the entire job for you. We source companies according to the description you give us of your customer segmentation, and then give you the champion you’re looking for at those companies.<p>Please register and give us your feedback.","time":1577133483,"title":"Show HN: Be 10x more efficient prospecting leads","type":"story"},{"by":"CaliforniaKarl","descendants":51,"id":21867015,"kids":[21873485,21873966,21873444,21873705,21873617,21874351,21876014,21874746,21873881,21874636,21875057,21873936,21873573,21874876,21875538,21873493,21876277],"score":87,"time":1577132598,"title":"The Nightjet: A Big Bet on Train Travelers Who Take It Slow","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/23/business/overnight-train-austria.html"},{"by":"slapshot","descendants":3,"id":21867085,"kids":[21867831,21867668],"score":2,"time":1577133021,"title":"California Freelancers Sue to Stop AB5","type":"story","url":"https://reason.com/2019/12/23/california-freelancers-sue-to-stop-ab5-law-thats-destroying-their-jobs-pol-says-those-were-never-good-jobs-anyway/"},{"by":"syllable_studio","descendants":6,"id":21866800,"kids":[21868968,21867812,21868117,21867374,21871234],"score":89,"time":1577131349,"title":"The Periodic Table of Videos","type":"story","url":"http://www.periodicvideos.com/"},{"by":"mdlincoln","descendants":4,"id":21866795,"kids":[21878067,21879483,21877438],"score":11,"time":1577131306,"title":"Ghent Altarpiece: latest phase of restoration unmasks 16th century overpainting","type":"story","url":"https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/facelift-for-the-mystic-lamb"},{"by":"fewi","descendants":64,"id":21866750,"kids":[21869416,21867569,21869211,21867518,21867696,21868958,21867796,21868314,21869185,21867562,21867510,21867906,21869534,21868412,21868890,21869057,21867486],"score":43,"time":1577131048,"title":"New books mount aggressive but ultimately unpersuasive defenses of multiverses","type":"story","url":"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/multiverse-theories-are-bad-for-science/"},{"by":"lelf","descendants":19,"id":21866727,"kids":[21872805,21873167,21872789,21877032,21876269],"score":30,"time":1577130914,"title":"Apis Cor builds world's largest 3D-printed building in Dubai","type":"story","url":"https://www.dezeen.com/2019/12/22/apis-cor-worlds-largest-3d-printed-building-dubai/"},{"by":"cardimart","descendants":23,"id":21866636,"kids":[21867885,21867787,21869608,21867578,21870631,21868071],"score":253,"time":1577130300,"title":"How to Create the Apple Fifth Avenue Cube in WebGL","type":"story","url":"https://tympanus.net/codrops/2019/12/20/how-to-create-the-apple-fifth-avenue-cube-in-webgl/"},{"by":"bcaa7f3a8bbc","descendants":107,"id":21866563,"kids":[21869855,21868260,21867615,21869239,21869023,21869741,21871274,21868330,21869887,21869862,21869643,21868879,21869122,21868193,21869525,21869004],"score":104,"time":1577129861,"title":"Reviewing Bad Schematics as EE Interview Tactic","type":"story","url":"https://cushychicken.github.io/bad-schematic-interviews/"},{"by":"apsec112","descendants":26,"id":21866426,"kids":[21881672,21882162,21880649],"score":43,"time":1577129084,"title":"The Antarctic Ozone Hole Will Recover (2015)","type":"story","url":"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/30602"},{"by":"nabla9","descendants":172,"id":21866297,"kids":[21868036,21867394,21867421,21870315,21866733,21866799,21868109,21867587,21867171,21866838,21866925,21869207,21869441,21868902,21867017,21867109,21868716,21866723,21867236,21866669,21868180,21870808,21867642,21866999,21870556,21867150,21872183,21867922,21870925,21867737,21867322,21867888,21867407,21868400,21867800,21867894,21869439,21867353,21868033,21867274,21868028],"score":189,"time":1577128350,"title":"Researchers have identified 100 mysteriously disappeared stars in the night sky","type":"story","url":"https://www.sciencealert.com/a-look-through-past-star-catalogues-finds-scores-of-stars-that-have-mysteriously-vanished"},{"by":"behnamoh","descendants":14,"id":21866295,"kids":[21866613,21867084,21870416,21870520,21870013,21866323,21871037],"score":22,"time":1577128335,"title":"Why do Nigerian scammers say they're from Nigeria?

Some common examples for the organizational structure for handling multiple software development teams?)<p>* defining and measuring KPIs and&#x2F;or OKRs for technical people in all the levels<p>* project management techniques and tools to gather all the data (and what data and how should I gather?) to be able to make any decisions<p>* talking to the management (reports, bridging the understanding between the business and the IT)<p>* everything else I haven&#x27;t thought about<p>I am looking more for a know-how that could be applied to existing enterprise as well. So more of an enterprise-way how-to than &quot;whatever works&quot; and &quot;let&#x27;s just do it the start-up way&quot;.","time":1577109257,"title":"Ask HN: Books and Courses for Wannabe CTOs and

It’s hard to explain. I have a lot of anxiety and analysis paralysis about this.<p>I’m hoping for some great resources to actually build something and learn at the same time, so I can get my confidence up and actually get some MVPs going so I can ‘learn by doing’.<p>I feel like every tutorial I look at either:<p>1. Starts out great, explaining stuff but then becomes outdated&#x2F;frustrating by the end (ex: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smashingmagazine.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;spotify-app-vue-nuxt-javascript&#x2F;)<p>2. Is WAY too basic. I don’t want to learn basic syntax over and over.<p>3. Keeps making me switch tech stacks. I just want to use Python&#x2F;Flask or learn JS&#x2F;Node. I want to use VUE just because it’s new and it’s docs seem good. I don&#x27;t even know what&#x27;s out there anymore or what&#x27;s good about it. I just want some consistency. Everyone says the stack doesn&#x27;t matter too much anyway.

I&#x27;ve got some experience managing myself, and mentoring other developers, running a business not so much. Currently I have the luxury to spend about a third of my time working on side projects.<p>I would like to try use this time to bootstrap a startup. The focus will be enterprise software for a specific industry, unrelated to my other work. However, I do have some insight, and connections to this industry. I want to manage the project as a single developer and eventually sell subscriptions to SaaS.<p>One model for funding is a single client that pays upfront (at discounted rate), with the understanding that it&#x27;s my product, and I&#x27;ll eventually on-sell it. This is not practical in the industry I want to focus on. My product should be impartial, not associated with a single player. An idea only will be too hard a sell, I&#x27;ll need a MVP to generate some interest.<p>Another approach is to pay for the project with my time, maybe also spend some savings paying contractors. I&#x27;ll be invoicing myself for developer time.<p>It occurred to me that I can give people the opportunity to buy in by paying a part of the cost. Maybe even pay for specific features. As incentive, rather than shares in a business, I would offer future profit sharing. Investors can buy in at any time and pay as much or as little as they want. The profit share is determined by the fraction of dev time that you&#x27;ve contributed, or paid for in cash. Does this make sense, am I using the right terminology? Am I just describing a specific type of share ownership in different words?<p>Anyone tried this before, any tips or recommendations on how to structure such an agreement?<p>Tbh, I imagine the subscriptions only making a modest amount of profit if the project is successful. I&#x27;m fairly confident the bootstrap cost can be kept to a minimum. If costs start spiraling, or subscriptions just don&#x27;t sell I want to walk away and continue doing contract work.","time":1576837074,"title":"Ask HN: Partial Bootstrap for a SaaS Startup","type":"story"},{"by":"lelf","descendants":61,"id":21842663,"kids":[21851299,21850248,21851939,21850884,21851066,21850415,21850774,21851029,21851611,21851565,21850549,21851320,21852495,21852711,21850593,21850215,21850482,21850356],"score":151,"time":1576832681,"title":"Outdoor Computing with a Deck Desk","type":"story","url":"https://mgsloan.com/posts/deck-desk/"},{"by":"tosh","descendants":10,"id":21842644,"kids":[21856153,21856055,21854951,21854764,21857147,21857220],"score":104,"time":1576832499,"title":"SBCL20 in Vienna","type":"story","url":"https://lispblog.xach.com/post/189764932688/sbcl20-in-vienna"},{"by":"bachmeier","descendants":81,"id":21842639,"kids":[21852378,21853770,21851557,21853343,21853216,21851035,21851179,21852579,21851413,21850113,21853737,21852703,21851395,21853807,21852610,21851791,21852492,21853588,21854148,21853819,21852499],"score":85,"time":1576832449,"title":"The Joy of Perl (1998)","type":"story","url":"https://www.salon.com/1998/10/13/feature_269/"},{"by":"pseudolus","descendants":53,"id":21843225,"kids":[21843313,21843307,21843674,21846897,21843366,21843247,21843376,21843386,21843319,21843423],"score":50,"time":1576839971,"title":"Airbnb Isn’t Uber, Says European Court of Justice","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-12-20/airbnb-isn-t-uber-says-european-court-of-justice"},{"by":"2fast4you","descendants":40,"id":21842673,"kids":[21843118,21843199,21843152,21843196,21843327,21843110,21843349,21843283,21843297,21843521,21843351,21843274],"score":46,"time":1576832799,"title":"Santa Hat on VScode Insiders","type":"story","url":"https://reddit.com/r/programming/comments/ed4xjd/santa_hat_on_vscode_insiders_and_pushing_of/"},{"by":"kvalle","descendants":6,"id":21842525,"kids":[21845051,21852675,21843795,21842722],"score":26,"time":1576830695,"title":"Functors – What Are They?","type":"story","url":"https://functional.christmas/2019/20"},{"by":"phate004","descendants":96,"id":21842480,"kids":[21844118,21843941,21843913,21845661,21844111,21844057,21844168],"score":90,"time":1576830165,"title":"Huawei expected to surpass Apple to become world’s No 2 phone maker","type":"story","url":"https://cntechpost.com/2019/12/20/huawei-smartphone-shipments-expected-to-reach-230-million-this-year/"},{"by":"JeanMarcS","descendants":65,"id":21842423,"kids":[21844037,21842485,21843345,21842520,21842596,21842487,21842543,21842805,21842499,21842534,21842577,21842509,21842742,21842562,21842498,21842511,21842554,21842472],"score":175,"time":1576829182,"title":"267M Facebook users IDs and phone numbers exposed online","type":"story","url":"https://www.comparitech.com/blog/information-security/267-million-phone-numbers-exposed-online/"},{"by":"psibi","descendants":48,"id":21841951,"kids":[21842264,21842073,21842108,21842070,21842165,21842781,21845811,21842269],"score":49,"time":1576820309,"title":"The Fundamental Problem in Python 3","type":"story","url":"https://changelog.complete.org/archives/10063-the-fundamental-problem-in-python-3"},{"by":"luu","descendants":6,"id":21842075,"kids":[21842298,21844420,21847474,21845386,21869902],"score":118,"time":1576823019,"title":"Dungeon Generation in Enter The Gungeon","type":"story","url":"https://www.boristhebrave.com/2019/07/28/dungeon-generation-in-enter-the-gungeon/"},{"by":"FpUser","descendants":27,"id":21841841,"kids":[21842062,21842743,21842311,21842355,21843007,21842906,21842442,21842096,21843030,21844067,21847161,21842512,21842914,21843215],"score":152,"text":"The Inquirer is closing the curtains.

I immediately turned off telemetry.  I then configured a few things in vim to my liking.<p>I started with some python code I&#x27;ve been hacking at here and there.  Once I configured it to find the system python3 libs etc and started writing code it worked nearly perfectly.  I was somewhat impressed.<p>Then, I decided to see what it did to the system...<p>It has an open connection to an AWS machine. I knew at this point I was done but I decided to snoop a little more.<p>It&#x27;s not very easy on resources and spins up the DGPU so my battery will get eaten in ~2 instead of ~4.5ish hours.<p>It wants you to log in, even though it supposedly keeps everything local now.<p>I found no documented way to shut it all down outside of kill -9<p>So, I cleaned it all off my machine and cleaned up the mess it left.<p>The reason I&#x27;ve posted this is because I want to see how others reacted to it.  How will any money be made giving it away?  Are we creating another little baby google?

If to troubleshoot further you need a client reaching out from my side to some service on your network designed to evaluate things, then pretty much all of us have web browsers which not only do HTTP but have evolved to do socket-level communication.

It’s like Tile, but for B2B or Enterprise.<p>Got-it is for tracking things at work as a team.  Simply peel and stick, no different from a barcode sticker.  But, these are active Bluetooth labels.  They&#x27;re flexible and roughly the size of a little Avery barcode label (28mm x 76mm) and less than 0.5mm thick.  They communicate with the phones already in employee pockets, even in background mode.  That means no scanning like RFID, and no readers or gateway infrastructure to install in the ceiling or the doorways.<p>A few photos here: (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;gallery&#x2F;rApt25P\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;gallery&#x2F;rApt25P</a>)<p>We started Got-it as a solution for all that really simple stuff that went missing at home.  There were loads of little things, like iPhone charger cables or even Chapstick, that when forgotten or went missing, made life a little difficult.  Sure, I could put a Bluetooth tracker on everything… but they’re expensive and a little clunky, especially for a $1.99 stick of Chapstick.  The reality though, is that when stuff around the house goes missing, it’s just kinda annoying.   At work, it’s a different ballgame.  It costs money.<p>Here’s how it works for businesses.  Anyone at work sticks a label on shared things like tools, equipment, storage boxes, or packages to ship.   By everyone just walking around as normal, in a warehouse, factory, or campus, the Got-it app picks up a beacon from the labels.  The location of the item (within an approximate 10 meter zone) and who it’s been with, is then shared with the team if a coworker needs to know.<p>Our integrated software stack makes it happen.  We stumbled on a way to make our Bluetooth beacon firmware more reliably trigger background processing in phones, while still preserving ultra low power consumption.  To do so, we ended up writing low-level embedded code, in less than 1.5KB and 135 Bytes RAM, to control the radio registers directly, without a BLE stack.  Phones receive just enough information from our labels to enable a lean, low-power positioning algorithm we wrote.<p>The labels we make ourselves, in house, here in the USA and UK.  It’s a reel-to-reel manufacturing process (like making tape) that we developed.  We’re printing circuits using coatings on thin films.  We can create passive components, like inductors and capacitors using these inks and laminates by taking advantage of the thin geometry of the substrate itself.  Our bill of materials is just a few lines long, so sourcing in China isn’t needed.<p>We also came up with a way of electrochemically coating our circuit to form our own battery source that lasts over a year.  That’s particularly why we decided to keep the manufacturing in-house.  The process is fully automated, involving just the machine we built, and an operator.  It just didn’t make sense to hand over the manufacturing IP to a contract manufacturer or outsource this to China.<p>Manufacturing ourselves, locally, also helps in avoiding tariffs and contract manufacturing mark-ups.  That’s key since the labels will be sold in volume at very small margins.   The company makes money from a recurring SW model around asset and inventory tracking services.  Note, the $99 pricing for ten labels on our website is just for the kit to get started today with your company team.  Our target cost at scale will be less than $1.<p>We just ran our first pre-production lot, and are pre-launching with some inventory to ship right away.   It’d be great to learn your thoughts on how Got-its might work for you or applications we might be missing.    We’re ramping our manufacturing line into higher volume production in the Spring of next year.  Keep tabs on our twitter @realGot_it for launch announcements.<p>Thanks in advance!\nBrian","time":1576519185,"title":"Launch HN: Got-it (YC W19) – Bluetooth labels for tracking things at work","type":"story"},{"by":"panarky","descendants":79,"id":21805111,"kids":[21805768,21805515,21805785,21807688,21808980,21807869,21812485,21809047,21821150,21811723,21809052,21809533,21806281,21805438,21805588],"score":345,"time":1576518520,"title":"‘Evil Corp,’ a $100M Cybercrime Menace","type":"story","url":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/12/inside-evil-corp-a-100m-cybercrime-menace/"},{"by":"LinuxBender","descendants":3,"id":21805065,"kids":[21805537,21805512],"score":7,"time":1576518246,"title":"One in every 172 active RSA certificates are vulnerable to attack","type":"story","url":"https://www.zdnet.com/article/1-in-every-172-active-rsa-certificates-are-vulnerable-to-exploit/"},{"by":"tomerv","descendants":30,"id":21804988,"kids":[21805336,21806291,21806125,21806109,21805687,21805557,21805477,21805787,21805763,21810387,21805609,21810252,21810288,21805895,21807816,21805460,21809825],"score":99,"time":1576517801,"title":"Book Review: All Therapy Books","type":"story","url":"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/11/20/book-review-all-therapy-books/"},{"by":"Tomte","descendants":64,"id":21804986,"kids":[21805279,21805445,21807048,21805141,21807332,21806418,21805669,21805810,21812975,21810950,21805090,21805416,21805356,21805143],"score":99,"time":1576517798,"title":"Airbus Beluga XL","type":"story","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_Beluga_XL"},{"by":"evilops","descendants":15,"id":21804977,"kids":[21805522,21805331,21805321,21805576,21820925,21806537,21805528,21805534],"score":23,"time":1576517769,"title":"Marissa Mayer’s new project is a suite of timesaving apps","type":"story","url":"https://www.fastcompany.com/90429893/marissa-mayers-new-project-is-a-suite-of-time-saving-apps"},{"by":"dilloc","descendants":122,"id":21804939,"kids":[21805600,21805379,21806882,21806784,21805828,21805544,21807664,21805146,21805673,21809760,21810640,21811857,21810024,21808575,21805212,21806150,21806788],"score":266,"time":1576517558,"title":"2020 Cloud Report: AWS vs. GCP vs. Azure","type":"story","url":"https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/2020-cloud-report/#"},{"by":"Kaibeezy","descendants":2,"id":21805047,"kids":[21805193,21805069],"score":3,"time":1576518177,"title":"3,600-year-old disposable cup shows even our ancestors hated doing dishes","type":"story","url":"https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/ancient-single-use-cup-intl-scli-gbr-scn/index.html"},{"by":"xrd","descendants":13,"id":21805050,"kids":[21805394,21806455,21808597,21811762,21811766,21806557,21806736],"score":58,"time":1576518191,"title":"We Kept Almost Making Money","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-12-16/we-kept-almost-making-money"},{"by":"apress","descendants":56,"id":21804896,"kids":[21805075,21806483,21805572,21806511,21805722,21807146,21805430,21805417,21807674,21808206,21812334,21805764,21805340,21806299,21806151],"score":137,"time":1576517370,"title":"Play AI Dungeon 2.

List started out as a simple list of visa requirements for all countries with detailed visa process and documents for 50 countries so that travellers can go anywhere they want easily. This was a solution to visa issues I faced when I wanted to travel. Since then it&#x27;s grown to 100+ countries and now features visa exemptions, dual passport requirements and many data points like flight prices, weather, distance, economy status and travel advice. I’m adding new countries every day so that you can use Visa List for all your visa requirements.\nVisa List makes money mostly from ads and affiliates. Most of the site is freely usable but to use some filters, community chat and visa advice, you need to pay. Users pay monthly, annual or once for a lifetime membership. Revenue ranges from $5,000&#x2F;m to $6,000&#x2F;m. It became profitable after 2 months of launch.<p>But it didn&#x27;t start making $5000 immediately, it started with $500 per month and grew slowly over the span of a year.<p>Initially I placed ads on visa list and was getting around 100K pageviews around a month. But the ads revenue was not that great at all. I tried to apply for skyscanner partnership because I knew that there would be good need after getting visa, but unfortunately I got rejected. I think the main reason was it was I was not getting a lot of traffic.<p>With a heavy heart I tried different ad networks like video ads, content ads but none of them improved the revenue. All this while, i never lost sight of my goal to increase the SEO and along the way get more users to Visa List.<p>Suddenly after a month I got an email from skyscanner from saying that they are interested in partnering with, this was another team. I was so happy and realised that things come around eventually. In a month I integrated skyscanner and it started a good stream of revenue from visa list.<p>After 5 month around june, people from iVisa contacted me. They provide visa service and visa assistance across the world which was perfect. I was very happy to partner with them as well and thus opened 3rd revenue stream.<p>Along the way I also learning AdOps so i could monetize the traffic I was getting and finally after 6 months things started working out. So my first channel also started contributing a good chunk to overall revenue.<p>After around 8 month i started an experiment with Visa List membership which i have been sitting on it for a long time. I was not really sure what was the most valuable information that travelers really need so they won&#x27;t mind paying. Looking at Nomad list and starter story, i finally put in a set of features that i thought can be useful for Pro members.

I naturally became familiar with the work of professors. I decided that when I grew up, I wanted to be just like them and invent new, novel type systems and contribute to the field. My goal was to go to a good college that was strong in PL theory, where I could meet the professors that I look up to and do research.<p>My Cornell rejection is a huge wake-up call for me. I had deluded myself into imagining an acceptance. There are only a few schools in the US that do PL theory, and almost all of them are selective (Cornell, UPenn, CMU, etc). There are some less selective schools that do PL research, such as Northeastern, but they may not be ideal in other aspects (e.g. not being strong in math). Cornell is supposed to be the &quot;easiest&quot; of the Ivies. If I couldn&#x27;t get into Cornell, there&#x27;s no guarantee that I&#x27;ll get into my other choices.<p>Around me, my peers are celebrating getting into Harvard, Dartmouth, Stanford, etc. I don&#x27;t know what I did wrong. My GPA and standardized test scores are high. Were my essays bad? Other people just don&#x27;t understand me. If someone wants to study linguistics or economics, people know what that means. But nobody knows what &quot;type theory&quot; is, and &quot;computer science&quot; and &quot;math&quot; are both big-tent labels that encompass many things. The people who helped me edit my essays didn&#x27;t really understand what I was talking about, either. Most people don&#x27;t truly know what math is, have never heard of abstract algebra, topology, and category theory, and think that math is just number crunching and don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s past calculus. The admissions officers have probably never written a line of code in their lives; how could I explain to them the beauty of the Curry-Howard correspondence and constructive math?<p>My weak point is my lack of extracurriculars. I haven&#x27;t done that many activities or won that many awards because I preferred to spend the most of my time learning math at home. These past years, I&#x27;ve been working on my own ML dialect, which features HM type inference, ADTs and pattern matching, etc. I wrote about this in my essay and explained how I wanted to do PL research at Cornell. But as my mom explained, the admissions people don&#x27;t get this stuff. The work I&#x27;ve done might be impressive, but I don&#x27;t have any way (e.g. awards or attention) to quantify that to non-programmers. I haven&#x27;t publicized my language much because it isn&#x27;t &quot;done&quot; yet, so it doesn&#x27;t have users. My downfall was expecting that my language would be an impressive activity. My mom explained that a professor might be impressed, but to a layperson, this stuff isn&#x27;t as impressive as say, a robotics competition, even if my language is actually more technical. If only I could talk to a professor instead; they would surely understand!<p>I&#x27;m scared about my future because the purpose of my life had been to pursue type theory, which requires me to get into a good college as an undergrad, then get into a good grad school. If this doesn&#x27;t pan out, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do with my life. I won&#x27;t be able to stand four years at any random college, where none of the professors know PL theory and there are no PL courses.

P != NP: A contradictory proof is unlikely and the distinction remains relevant for quantum computing.<p>3. Lambda calculus and combinatory logic: Richest model of computation available today.<p>4. First-class continuations: Every stateful program must have continuations. First-class continuations let programs write themselves.<p>5. Fixed points: Find equilibrium in complex systems.<p>6. Random variable: Universal abstraction to represent input to a procedure.<p>7. Interventional distributions: Capture causality under uncertainty.<p>8.

It implements opinionated query language, which is backwards compatible with PromQL from Prometheus. Is it called Extended PromQL [1]. It slightly derives from the original PromQL in controversial cases [2]. Additionally it implements user-friendly functionality on top of PromQL:<p>* `WITH templates` (aka `CTE expressions`) [3].<p>* User-friendly simplifications such as `rate(q)` as a shorthand to `rate(q[$__interval])`.<p>* Additional functions and operators aimed towards solving practical issues, which cannot be solved with the original PromQL.<p>VictoriaMetrics constantly evolves and sometimes implements Prometheus feature requests. For instance, recently it gained the ability to show the lower and upper bounds of the estimation returned by `histogram_quantile()` [4]. I mentioned about this in the original feature request, so users could find the solution. This led to the post from Prometheus devs [5], where they:<p>* Blame VictoriaMetrics for pointing Prometheus and Thanos users to solutions for their issues in public channels.<p>* Say that VictoriaMetrics cannot use `PromQL` word in the documentation, since it is registered trademark. Why anybody didn&#x27;t patent SQL yet?<p>To me this looks like a case for unfair competition.

I was assigned some work &quot;to keep me busy for 2-3 months&quot; that I finished in about 6 hours.<p>I&#x27;m really running out of patience with this whole thing. I&#x27;m being paid $25&#x2F;hr to sit around and look busy. I ask my manager for work, he says things will pick up after Christmas. The other day I was too depressed about this situation and slept in, and showed up at 1pm. No one batted an eyelid or said anything. There wasn&#x27;t a single email addressed to me, I had no calendar invites, no nothing, so why should I even be here? What do I do with my time? Well, I am trying to teach myself a bit of Ruby on Rails in AWS, do some freecodecamp (I desperately want to learn to code, under the impression that it will liberate me from this, but it might just be a pipe dream).<p>My manager told me that a coworker would like my help with &quot;business continuity forms&quot; (this is healthcare IT, so this is a thing). I&#x27;ve approached her and reminded her that I&#x27;m happy to help whenever she wants but she just grumbles about not being able to find someone to walk me through the EpicCare web app things.<p>So I am really losing my motivation to keep learning important things, and find myself drifting over to Reddit memes. I spend about 3-4 hours a day on this site and the rest of the time trying to teach myself computer science stuff. But it is extremely demoralizing doing this alone and &quot;secretly&quot; while waiting for something to happen.<p>I would look for a new job but frankly, I don&#x27;t even know if this experience is transferable anywhere else. I get declined for internal job postings, so I think I just need to turn my 6 months&#x27; experience into a year to appease HR.

Then again, manually doing backups is error-prone as well, as you might simply forget to copy something, or you might accidentally move files instead of copying them. Data size (due to duplication) is becoming a pain point as well.<p>Some solutions recently recommended on HN are Borg and Restic. Borg doesn&#x27;t appear to support Windows. I was really excited about Restic, but then I found some &quot;traps&quot; in the documentation that make me hesitant to use it; I don&#x27;t want to become an expert in the internals of the backup software, I just want some simple software that I can use with confidence that it&#x27;s not going to break on me. As an example of a trap in Restic, it will fail to make incremental copies of the same file if the file system modification timestamp and size of the file have not changed (it will simply keep the first version of the file). I&#x27;ve noticed that TrueCrypt containers behave like this on Windows (the file system modification date and size remain the same even though the contents change). This means that Restic will silently fail to backup TrueCrypt containers, while simultaneously pretending to the user that the backup was successful. I don&#x27;t want to use any backup software that has traps like this.<p>Basically, I just want simple backup software that deduplicates data, allowing incremental backups over time, and doesn&#x27;t have any traps that might cause accidental data loss.

I&#x27;ve been forced to change my design more than once during code review and there were other times when my PR was outright rejected as it did not meet the required standards.<p>Now I&#x27;m a little worried that if my situation doesn&#x27;t change, my career would suffer. I&#x27;ve started to watch a few videos online about design.  But I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;re going to really help as they usually talk about very basics which doesn&#x27;t help in real world coding.<p>I usually take 3-4 tries with some significant amount of testing to get my code to a working state.  I refer to stack overflow or ask my colleagues if I get stuck on some design &#x2F; technology feature which I haven&#x27;t seen before. I feel the above contributes to reduction in my speed of delivery and the rush to complete the deliverable on time, compromises the quality.<p>Are there any good ideas to improve one&#x27;s coding &#x2F; design skills significantly ?

For instance, I would imagine a dependable clock (eg one that doesn&#x27;t reset to 1&#x2F;1&#x2F;1970 ever time it restarts) is necessary, but do they all have to be in sync or is some measure of skewing acceptable? Anything else?<p>3) Is there a list of reliable (future proof) uuid implementations we can use to cover all the major languages or are the standard libraries sufficient for v4&#x2F;v5 uuid gens?

two years ago I found myself in a deep depression, burnt out, and I quit my job. Luckily, I was in a place financially and personally to be able to take a break from work. I didn’t really have a plan, I just knew that something needed to change.<p>I’m happy to report that I was able to find a way out of my depression, and I would like to resume my fulfilling career as a developer (which was mostly as a frontend developer). But I’m lost as to the best way to do so. I originally got my first job through self teaching and a boot camp. I feel as though I “sold” myself as a self motivated, smart guy who was ready to tackle whatever. That “sale” worked because that is what I was, I’m not a good salesman, I just told the truth. I quickly moved up in pay and responsibility over four and a half years.<p>Now, however, I struggle with the idea that I seem washed up, and out of practice. I’ve taken some online courses and done open source work. But my history looks like patchwork (ala Github graph), and I haven’t had a real job in two years.<p>I know the common strategies: build something, write a blog, work as a freelancer, etc. In order to get back into the game. I was able to get myself my first job with no experience, but now I feel like I’m less employable because of my hiatus.<p>I wasn’t sure how this post would come out. It turned out that I used “I feel” a lot. I know the practical steps to get back into my career. Maybe I’m looking for encouragement.

Because it would take too much work to connect to several 3rd party apps from day one.<p>Right, so my question is:<p>Would there be demand for a service like Zapier, but transparent and white label that works from inside your SaaS dashboard?<p>I mean, instead of having to send your users to Zapier, tell them to create an account, set up a Zap, pay membership fees, wouldn&#x27;t it be easier if all of your users could directly integrate with other apps as if you had a native integration?<p>Instead of the end-user paying for Zapier, the SaaS company would pay a small $ fee per each 1000 actions on the integration platform.<p>Because the alternative (as far as I know) is to spend several engineering hours integrating with many apps, and this process is repeated across thousands of SaaS companies. Then you also have to maintain all those integrations.<p>Does any SaaS entrepreneurs here feel this pain?","time":1575576772,"title":"Ask HN: Is there demand for a “White-label Zapier”?","type":"story"},{"by":"sama","dead":true,"id":21715608,"kids":[21716117,21717189,21716049,21716430,21718517],"score":28,"time":1575574452,"title":"The Great CEO Within","type":"story","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Great-CEO-Within-Tactical-Building-ebook/dp/B07ZLGQZYC"},{"by":"Pete_D","descendants":71,"id":21715426,"kids":[21716266,21716548,21718757,21719032,21719786,21719361],"score":75,"time":1575573505,"title":"Monads, or Programmable Semicolons (2014)","type":"story","url":"https://zacharyvoase.com/2014/04/30/monads/"},{"by":"prismatic","descendants":18,"id":21715401,"kids":[21725053,21725088,21724686,21727803,21724629,21726125,21725026],"score":108,"time":1575573359,"title":"John Berger’s ‘Ways of Seeing’ Exploded a Discipline","type":"story","url":"https://aeon.co/essays/john-bergers-ways-of-seeing-and-his-search-for-home"},{"by":"alvatech","descendants":4,"id":21715388,"kids":[21715785,21715675,21715422],"score":2,"time":1575573319,"title":"Aramco prices shares at $8.53, with the total valuation of $1.7T","type":"story","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/05/saudi-aramco-prices-shares-at-the-top-of-the-range-for-record-ipo-report-says.html"},{"by":"JumpCrisscross","descendants":115,"id":21715167,"kids":[21719070,21721179,21718889,21723403,21721219,21722359,21720653,21719130,21715454,21720576],"score":151,"time":1575572289,"title":"Amazon Dodges Responsibility for Unsafe Products","type":"story","url":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-amazon-dodges-responsibility-for-unsafe-products-the-case-of-the-hoverboard-11575563270"},{"by":"hirundo","dead":true,"id":21715664,"kids":[21716198,21716234,21716177,21716248,21716139,21716630,21716977,21716474,21716243,21716188,21716470,21715816,21716205],"score":35,"time":1575574709,"title":"Why Sexual Morality May Be Far More Important Than You Ever Thought","type":"story","url":"https://www.kirkdurston.com/blog/unwin"},{"by":"aerophilic","descendants":98,"id":21715072,"kids":[21727411,21727218,21727917,21726281,21728798,21727976,21728622,21728355,21727758,21728730,21728980,21727562,21719144,21726097,21719146,21725972,21719664],"score":136,"time":1575571896,"title":"A Billion Surveillance Cameras Forecast to Be Watching Within Two Years","type":"story","url":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-billion-surveillance-cameras-forecast-to-be-watching-within-two-years-11575565402"},{"by":"howard941","descendants":318,"id":21715018,"kids":[21716752,21715428,21718067,21715733,21715645,21715892,21716527,21716190,21715643,21718577,21715838,21716979,21715789,21718464,21719717,21717106,21716302,21716184,21719296,21718218,21717164,21716960,21715979,21715883,21715722,21715527,21715557],"score":375,"time":1575571623,"title":"Battery Pack Prices Fall As Market Ramps Up","type":"story","url":"https://about.bnef.com/blog/battery-pack-prices-fall-as-market-ramps-up-with-market-average-at-156-kwh-in-2019/?sf113554299=1"},{"by":"smacktoward","dead":true,"id":21715019,"kids":[21715434,21715436,21715433],"score":16,"time":1575571638,"title":"Pete Buttigieg Won’t Talk About His Secret Work at McKinsey","type":"story","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pete-buttigieg-secret-work-mckinsey_n_5de83018e4b00149f73aef4e?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWVtZW9yYW5kdW0uY29tL20v&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEs1vx2OChoCVNycUgolq4RnkjZpgm9CcVT6czSSajKrNMlc7TsvG-cITuSOI1mnd2lLfY-sqH3oBea4UF2gtxyTlXmRUDfsYOyMYVtjHN4LY2-bvgdEijbCsxK0I8OYTNSj7rhNrCIid93AJ7JiwxZs68U3LzCliG-WaSZEMBzf"},{"by":"danso","descendants":715,"id":21714969,"kids":[21720276,21716287,21719411,21716458,21715787,21716313,21717128,21715559,21717382,21715610,21715612,21718366,21717146,21715504,21718477,21718430,21716415,21715579,21716419,21715471,21722285,21715650,21720187,21717212,21720202,21718604,21723731,21717710,21719025,21719662,21720253,21718531,21716697,21783586,21715642,21715627,21716465,21715502,21719010,21715668,21715206,21717144,21719133,21717134,21715674,21715473],"score":308,"time":1575571425,"title":"A Week in the Life of a McDonald’s Cashier","type":"story","url":"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/zmjjnj/how-i-get-by-a-week-in-the-life-of-a-mcdonalds-cashier"},{"by":"johnny313","descendants":239,"id":21714795,"kids":[21715029,21715196,21715420,21715100,21715225,21714906,21715304,21714920,21715079,21715128,21714894,21715058,21797183,21715188,21781032,21788226,21715107,21714971,21722651,21715747,21715383,21715218,21715023,21715480,21715003,21715191,21715272,21716030,21714959,21715232,21715358,21718729,21715369,21714997,21715294,21715598,21714877,21715425],"score":107,"time":1575570445,"title":"Drivers Refuse to Put Down Their Phones.

Most of the jobs listed are technical (developers, DevOps, etc.) and the non-technical jobs always feel like an afterthought.<p>So, I decided to make Remote Poet (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;remotepoet.com) - remote jobs for creative people. Obviously the word “creative” has quite a few meanings, but I am including any jobs that can be considered artistic or creative in a general sense. The categories I&#x27;ve listed on the site are:<p>- Animation and Motion Graphics<p>- Art<p>- Architecture and Interior Design<p>- Content Marketing<p>- Editing &#x2F; Copyediting<p>- Fashion<p>- Film &#x2F; Video<p>- Graphic Design<p>- Illustration<p>- Marketing<p>- Music &#x2F; Audio<p>- Photography<p>- Product Design<p>- Technical Writing<p>- UX &#x2F; UI<p>- Video Games<p>- Writing &#x2F; Copywriting<p>At some point, I may add programming jobs (as they are definitely “creative” in some sense) but the niche of remote software jobs seems pretty full.

My question is for those who have already achieved my goal:<p>Would you recommend an MBA?<p>Are there any shorter courses in Silicon Valley than the MBA, which have proven their worth among many founders?<p>If not, can someone recommend some business books (like accounting, financial management...) that have helped him to set up and manage a company with a turnover of $1-10 Million ARR?<p>Thank you very much :-)","time":1575475364,"title":"$10M ARR SaaS Business Founder","type":"story"},{"by":"herodotus","descendants":2,"id":21703283,"kids":[21704814,21703332],"score":4,"time":1575475266,"title":"Peloton exercise bike ad mocked as being 'sexist' and 'dystopian'","type":"story","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50649826"},{"by":"aldamiz","descendants":202,"id":21703297,"kids":[21706342,21705890,21709798,21703806,21705489,21705914,21709811,21706086,21706068,21703488,21707846,21705869,21703441,21706467,21708294,21706706,21708317,21706978,21712738,21706478,21708099,21707844,21710631,21709770,21712033,21707894,21705984,21705866,21705922,21705606,21711247,21706007,21709148,21708053,21709949,21704873,21705552,21705978,21705713,21708801,21710600,21706127],"score":292,"time":1575475342,"title":"How to proceed when you run out of cash, but you still believe?","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@aldamiz/how-to-proceed-when-you-run-out-of-cash-but-you-still-believe-76de86b839f2"},{"by":"huihuiilly","descendants":2,"id":21703091,"kids":[21703890,21703202],"score":6,"time":1575474123,"title":"Prosecutors use a system of “strikes” to engineer nearly all-white juries","type":"story","url":"https://bostonreview.net/law-justice/sonali-chakravarti-one%E2%80%99s-peers"},{"by":"rowland_street","descendants":532,"id":21703018,"kids":[21703463,21703394,21703794,21703413,21703460,21705020,21703387,21703397,21704426,21703610,21703696,21703878,21704879,21703518,21703892,21705330,21704257,21703474,21703844,21703665,21704565,21703395,21703666,21704654,21703979,21704262,21703616,21705170,21703560,21707216,21703898,21705050,21704028,21703788,21707412,21703829,21703569,21703778,21704260,21703746,21706688,21703819,21705887,21704998,21706308,21704606,21703906,21705987,21704593,21703922,21703355,21703651,21703916,21703640,21705252,21706627,21703623,21706185,21703624,21713953,21705541,21703679,21703739,21704884,21709552,21705700,21704341,21705147,21711036,21703433,21704147,21703427,21704715,21704050,21704342,21703685,21703884],"score":344,"time":1575473767,"title":"Generating a Java program with 90% less code","type":"story","url":"https://www.unitily.com/articles/boilerplate.html"},{"by":"asdfasdf45","descendants":3,"id":21702985,"kids":[21703531,21702991],"score":5,"time":1575473582,"title":"Show HN: Locklock.io – Lock-as-a-service, REST API for easy distributed locking","type":"story","url":"https://locklock.io"},{"by":"zabana","descendants":6,"id":21702733,"kids":[21708887,21706079,21702842,21703346,21702764,21703955,21711467],"score":14,"time":1575471831,"title":"Ask HN: Do you keep a journal, and why?","type":"story"},{"by":"mmhsieh","descendants":5,"id":21702659,"kids":[21708360,21709657,21704926],"score":38,"time":1575471435,"title":"The Ergodicity Problem in Economics","type":"story","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-019-0732-0"},{"by":"jazzex","descendants":16,"id":21702554,"kids":[21703426,21709485,21719342,21702706,21704625,21710523,21709656,21705486,21707657,21713075,21712879,21716770,21703905,21719384,21708123,21711514],"score":16,"text":"Ill Start.<p>1.

I scanned my boarding pass and began walking towards the skybridge to board the plane and a customs agent stepped in front of me and asked if I was carrying more than $5,000 in cash on me, to which I responded &quot;no&quot;. He then said &quot;okay, we are doing a test today, you get to help us out with this test and can tell your friends about it won&#x27;t that be cool?&quot; and had me put on a jacket which looked roughly similar to the one I had on. I thought &quot;okay, this is kinda weird but whatever I&#x27;ll help you guys out&quot;.<p>I should mention this guy had a thick Russian accent&#x2F;imperfect English, but his uniform looked legit. At no point did he mention participation was optional. He held onto my passport while I put on the jacket (over the jacket I was already wearing) and I proceeded to walk down the skybridge towards the plane, but he almost immediately stopped me and said &quot;walk slowly&quot;. At the other end of the skybridge there were about 4 - 8 TSA agents and a sniffer dog. At this point I got skeptical of the situation and started feeling around the jacket expecting to find some sort of contraband, and ended up finding a brick-shaped lump of what I am guessing was either drugs, fake drugs or cash either in the jacket pocket or sewn into the jacket itself. I held up the lump inside the jacket and looked toward the agent with a &#x27;wtf?&#x27; look on my face, to which he responded &quot;it is currency&quot;.<p>At this point I became even more skeptical, took off the jacket and returned it to the agent and asked for my passport back. I then proceeded to board the plane without the jacket and the TSA agents reacted with a big &quot;aaaahh man!&quot; as if they really wanted me to board the plane with that jacket on.<p>This was my first time flying overseas, but I&#x27;m guessing this isn&#x27;t standard procedure.<p>Has anyone experienced something similar to this?

The ecosystem is thriving and most developers are happy using it.<p>Laravel: Made PHP cool again. Took lessons from Rails and probably provides the best Developer Experience when it comes to building a monolith app from development to deployment. PHP is also the most popular backend language.<p>Django: People love python. I hear that Django Rest Framework is a great tool, plus, the ability to add ml features on your existing app is a big plus.<p>Node.js: Full-stack Javascript is great but the backend landscape is a mess. Probably a thin backend without complex rails-like structure.<p>Phoenix&#x2F;Go&#x2F;Rust: Good options for specific use cases where performance matters.<p>Java&#x2F;C#: Complex and enterprisey. C# is gaining traction but the 3rd party ecosystem is still lacking behind other options.<p>Backendless: SPAs, Next.js&#x2F;Nuxt.js&#x2F;Ember, JAMstack. Use services like Firebase&#x2F;Auth0 and 3rd party APIs for backend logic or serverless functions.<p>What would you suggest someone learn in 2020?

keep thinking about this so I thought to ask HN&#x27;s opinion. We all know what bootcamps do. They charge you to train you and then you hope to get a job at a good company.<p>As a bootstrapped SAAS founder, I am finding it very hard to try and attract experienced talent as I cannot pay the high salaries for senior folks. However, I can afford to pay 60-70K USD&#x2F;Year with profit sharing options. The issue is that you have to work with us in our office at least for first few months before I am comfortable doing remote.<p>So I thought of an idea where I would run a web dev bootcamp as an employer. I will pay entry level folks to join the bootcamp and out of the batch, I will then hire the best candidates once bootcamp is over. So there really is no downside to the bootcampers.

We make it super easy to accept contributions and recurring memberships from your audience.<p>A bit of backstory - Joseph and I grew up in India. When I was 12, I started making a little bit of money from my blog, and it had a huge impact on my life. I got to buy books and gadgets, pay for web hosting, none of which I could’ve afforded otherwise. We built our first product in 2010. It was an ad network for bloggers called AdIndigo. There were a bunch of Adsense alternatives doing well at that time, and it grew to serve 6 million impressions at its peak. We later had to shut it down because of the expenses. Buy Me A Coffee is our third (and only successful) attempt at building for the creators.<p>When we started working on Buy Me A Coffee as a side project, it was a quick way to spin up a page or a button to accept one-time contributions. For artists, OSS developers, and YouTubers, it was an unobtrusive way to monetize their work. They appreciated the simplicity and friendly branding and started requesting more features. Some even noticed that they’re getting more contributions compared to a Patreon or PayPal button. It’s probably because of the no-signup-required payment flow. Supporters also get to leave a note after the payment, and it ends up becoming this ‘wall of love’ for creators.<p>Today, you can do a lot more with Buy Me A Coffee. You can accept recurring payments and give rewards in return. For e.g. Maria Shriver is using Buy Me A Coffee to monetize her newsletter ‘The Sunday Paper’ (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thesundaypaper.buymeacoffee.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thesundaypaper.buymeacoffee.com&#x2F;</a>) with a link in the footer of every edition. Slowly (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slowly.buymeacoffee.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slowly.buymeacoffee.com&#x2F;</a>) is a self-funded team using Buy Me A Coffee to accept contributions and feedback from their users. We also built Widgets that allow you to accept payments right from your website. Built-in email features let you share updates and rewards with your audience. We’re also working on a community feature to create a group chat with your supporters. Creators are already doing this with Discord and Slack, and we&#x27;re excited to build something more focused.<p>We believe anyone, anywhere in the world who creates something that people find useful or entertaining, should have the option to get paid for their work.<p>We’re excited to hear all your questions and thoughts about Buy Me A Coffee :) Thank you!","time":1575395973,"title":"Launch HN: Buy Me a Coffee (YC W19) – Give your audience a way to thank you","type":"story"},{"by":"joshfraser","descendants":3,"id":21694427,"kids":[21694600,21694466],"score":3,"time":1575394103,"title":"Trump Is First to Use Patriot Act to Detain a Man Forever","type":"story","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-invokes-patriot-act-to-detain-palestinian-adham-amin-hassoun-forever"},{"by":"jedberg","descendants":157,"id":21694428,"kids":[21696085,21695003,21694461,21695169,21694810,21694753,21694440,21694816,21695584,21694831,21709111,21695324,21694786,21705224,21720213,21694839,21695707,21696781,21699119,21694669],"score":137,"time":1575394112,"title":"Amazon Launches Managed Cassandra Service","type":"story","url":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-managed-apache-cassandra-service-mcs/"},{"by":"doener","descendants":1,"id":21694481,"kids":[21696515,21694597],"score":4,"time":1575394393,"title":"TikTok sent US user data to China, lawsuit claims","type":"story","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50640110"},{"by":"leeny","descendants":638,"id":21694348,"kids":[21697436,21697718,21695605,21697398,21695961,21695625,21695744,21699094,21697734,21695767,21696253,21694718,21695774,21699411,21695662,21695933,21695604,21695817,21697772,21705307,21698755,21695452,21696088,21698774,21700017,21695877,21698004,21697897,21697557,21698559,21697119,21698893,21700544,21697832,21700317,21699299,21695925,21698572,21697525,21699004,21700404,21695878,21697699,21704003,21728271,21699191,21697378,21696836,21706109,21699099],"score":327,"time":1575393716,"title":"We ran the numbers, and there really is a pipeline problem in engineering hiring","type":"story","url":"http://blog.interviewing.io/we-ran-the-numbers-and-there-really-is-a-pipeline-problem-in-eng-hiring/"},{"by":"mudil","descendants":2,"id":21694324,"kids":[21696980,21696940],"score":6,"time":1575393612,"title":"A tech company tried it all to stop employee turnover.

Give your users early access to your product when they share it with their friends!<p>I make A LOT of landing pages. Whenever I want to test an idea, I&#x27;ll make a website with a sign-up form to see how excited people are about a concept. I wanted to encourage word of mouth growth and incentivize my users to share these sites with their friends. Robinhood was able to amass nearly one million sign-ups via their referral program, so I tried googling for an easy way to add something similar to my page. Everything I found was expensive, too complicated and came pre-packaged with a landing page which I didn&#x27;t want. I ended up building a custom solution for myself and it worked great!<p>I noticed other friends launching projects doing the same, so we built Referlist to save everyone some time. No coding required. It&#x27;s plug-and-play like Drift. Takes 5 minutes to setup. It&#x27;s free to get started. You only pay if you get more than 100 sign-ups so you can feel free to launch as many failed experiments as your heart desires at no cost! You can export your users to CSV or Mailchimp.

We make it easy for founders to get all of the business insurance they need as they build their companies -- ranging from basic coverage for business property through to more complex coverages such as Directors and Officers (D&amp;O), Errors and Omissions (E&amp;O), Cyber, Employment Practices Liability and a range of others that companies need to close financings, scale their teams, do deals and take on office leases. Moreover, these policies protect against painful but all too frequent risks that we all face as we build our businesses.<p>We started Vouch after seeing how painful it is to get insurance the old way, and also experiencing many of the risk events that all-too-often happen as one scales a company. Previously I co-founded and led the U.S. arm of Funding Circle, a role I held up until our IPO last year; through this experience I had to purchase insurance many times -- and each time, the experience was slow, painful, opaque, and paper-based. Travis previously worked at Silicon Valley Bank and say that pain-point across their portfolio and, at the same time, saw the interesting developments in other insurance sectors -- Root, in auto insurance, for example -- and similarly believed that there must be a better way for startups to buy and manage their insurance.  Although there’s been a lot of work done on the distribution side of insurance (better agent and brokerage-type businesses) no one has really tried to build better insurance products tailored to meet the needs of startups.<p>Traditionally, a founder needs to go through a broker to purchase the coverages we offer directly, and that process can take weeks, or even months (it took us over 60 days to get the E&amp;O coverage we needed at Vouch to start writing business, as one ironic example). We designed the Vouch experience so that a typical company can get everything they need in under 10 minutes and with 0 paperwork. We also tailored the insurance products we’re offering to meet the unique needs of technology startups. As a result of this, our hope is that the entire experience should feel more tailored, and basic policies are quite affordable -- as little as $200&#x2F;year. Our basic package  is 30% cheaper than anything else we’ve seen in the market and on average we’re seeing our members save ~13% relative to other options.<p>We started the company after years of experience building and investing in other companies. Our view is that building a company is hard enough -- worrying about risk management and insurance shouldn’t be, and we’re building Vouch so that can be the case. We’re now live in eight states, and are excited to say that we can now serve companies based in CA -- a state that’s home to many startups. We’ll be in many states all across the country shortly, as we want to help entrepreneurs wherever they’re building great technology companies.<p>If you have questions about business insurance or any current insurance needs we’d love to connect. And we’d welcome reactions, feedback and any of your experiences around business insurance.

The recovery time is expected to be 6 to 8 weeks before I could return to work; although one patient recovered in 4 weeks. Several others died.<p>Should I request unpaid leave from my employer or just find a new job with a start date after a conservative recovery time? I am specifically concerned that revealing any weakness will compromise my compensation negotiation position. It is already a chore with my current employer to receive pay increases to accompany increased job responsibility. Management has a stronger position than I realized when I accepted the job. The tech side is very simple and much more of a minor contributor to the business value compared to sales and structural customer lock-in. Almost all of the engineers are second world contractors from multiple different agencies whereas the handful of stateside employees&#x27; purpose seems to be quality control through code reviews.<p>Has anyone here taken time off for surgery? Do you wish you had lined up another job offer first instead of requesting leave? Did management grant leave and then later retaliate after you returned to work?<p>For the small fraction of outcomes where I die, is there a best practice way to notify your employer?

out as an early stage start-up employee. I’ve been employed there a few years, worked miracles, but getting recently getting some poor feedback. Confusing situation. Wondering if I should just quit? Is career salvageable?\nI solved the business’ biggest issue. Start-up was founded to do X, founders couldn’t figure out how to do X, I was asked to do X. Under enormous pressure I single handily figured out how to do X, conducted all the R&amp;D, built the prototype, supervised the engineer and release. Its still a prototype, but solves one of the industries biggest problem. Non-founder team lead is unhappy some minor issues have slipping in the chaotic process of getting this to market. I’m doing several different jobs and do everything. My solution is going to change the market, the idea is worth millions of dollars, likely more.<p>Founders are very please, but getting poor feedback from team lead. Team lead has hindered more than helped, gives conflicting advice, blows hot and cold, has created a toxic environment etc. Admittedly some minor things have slipped through the cracks, but much of this comes from my team lead playing politics, creating silos and conflicts etc.<p>My team lead is grinding me down with their constant nitpicking and I really just want to go and do something else, anything else, work in a bar or something. Considered going to the founders with the issue, but I can’t see how this can be resolved beyond creating a new role or transferring out of my area of expertise. I did a sanity check and have reached out to others. Lots of others have take issue with my team lead as well, so its not just me.<p>I’m pretty burnout, and definitely in need to some time out before moving on. I don’t think I’d come across very well (or as sharp as I usually) in interviews at the moment without a break.<p>Anyone been through anything similar?

I understand that &#x27;idempotency&#x27; comes up a lot here, but whichever way I try to apply that here - it always seems to explode in a (fragile&#x2F;brittle) spaghetti of calls, error handling and subsequent calls.<p>Surely this has been resolved by now, but I&#x27;m having a hard time finding any good resources on how to approach this in an elegant manner.

The phone is much to small and sadly many PDFs don&#x27;t have convenient bookmarks. For example, I recently wanted to read at least parts of the UEFI spec which is a 2500 page PDF. No way I can effectively read that on my phone, or even really my PC.<p>So I&#x27;ve been wondering about ereaders like the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite. They&#x27;re pretty inexpensive, and have pretty good reviews, but the bad reviews are consistent (for the latest model). Screen glare, abhorrent battery life, dead pixel, buggy navigation.

We’re a modern diagnostics company, and we’ve created the first at-home UTI (urinary tract infection) test with same-day treatment options.<p>With a lifetime of experience in the diagnostics industry (literally––my family’s business is in manufacturing in-vitro diagnostics, and my first summer job was assembling pregnancy tests), I’ve always been interested in making these tests more convenient and cost-effective.<p>Why start with UTIs? Some studies estimate that up to 60% of women experience UTIs, prompting 10 million doctor visits in the US each year. Getting treatment for a UTI at urgent care costs around $150, while visits to the emergency room can cost over $2000––and one study found that ER visits for UTIs adds $4B a year in unnecessary healthcare costs. By taking the same urine test performed in doctor’s offices, hospitals, emergency rooms, etc. and making it accessible to anyone who has a Scanwell UTI test kit and a smartphone, we’re drastically reducing the time and cost it takes to treat UTIs.<p>Just like a traditional test, ours uses a chemically treated test strip that reacts with the patient’s urine sample. But instead of being read by a urine analyzer in a lab, the Scanwell app uses computer vision to assess the results. Results are provided to the patient in 2 minutes, with the same diagnostic accuracy as a urinalysis performed in a clinic. If the user has signs of a UTI, we’ll directly connect them to a healthcare provider who can prescribe treatment.<p>Our UTI product is FDA-cleared, and we are working to obtain clearances for other tests. One such test is our chronic kidney disease (CKD) test, which is currently being piloted with Kaiser Permanente to improve screening for and monitoring of chronic kidney disease at home.<p>Telehealth continues to grow but the piece that is missing is diagnostics, and that’s what we hope to provide. Whether it’s for detecting acute conditions like UTIs or managing longer term conditions like chronic kidney disease, we believe that the more we can enable at-home testing the more accessible healthcare will be for everyone.<p>We’re excited to hear your feedback and answer any questions you might have about Scanwell. Thanks everyone!","time":1574791159,"title":"Launch HN: Scanwell (YC S18) – At-home UTI test with same-day treatment options","type":"story"},{"by":"dennis714","descendants":48,"id":21640669,"kids":[21646091,21642354,21642321,21643363,21642719,21643227,21645019,21644569,21643886,21646537,21643688],"score":451,"time":1574790521,"title":"Reverse Engineering for Beginners [pdf]","type":"story","url":"https://beginners.re/RE4B-EN.pdf"},{"by":"burtonator","descendants":222,"id":21640510,"kids":[21640780,21641544,21641058,21640837,21640854,21641647,21640930,21641235,21640692,21640942,21640917,21640798,21641710,21640818,21640874,21641361,21641328,21641422,21640814,21641175,21641651,21641283,21640879,21641741,21644222,21640977,21643512,21640964,21640822,21641996,21640965,21642061,21643400,21641409,21640628,21654443,21641366,21641260,21640973,21646867,21640960,21641795,21642299,21651282,21641421,21649748,21641022,21641384,21642116,21641122,21642015,21642143,21643866,21641112,21641668,21641062,21643629,21641011,21640757,21640821,21641155,21640933,21641339,21641512,21641947,21640886,21640909,21640885],"score":241,"time":1574789708,"title":"Dark Mode by Default – 95% of People Prefer Dark over Light Mode","type":"story","url":"https://getpolarized.io/2019/11/25/Dark-Mode-Should-Be-The-Default-With-95-Percent-Preferring-it-Over-Light-Mode.html"},{"by":"prismatic","descendants":54,"id":21640517,"kids":[21648503,21648195,21653773,21648439,21654901,21648815,21653726,21652831,21649428,21650841,21648468,21647890],"score":42,"time":1574789734,"title":"Is It a ‘5’ or a ‘6’?

Earlier this year the support started deflecting all sales-related questions to &quot;your sales representative, who will get in touch with you shortly.&quot; What useв to be a 30 second chat to get the renewal price matched against the last year now turned into some painful bullshit that ended up with sales rep claiming no discounts were available, but he&#x27;d be willing to make a massive one-time exception of 5% off.<p>But the &#x2F;sysdev link still worked, the hope that these Symantec influences will blow over was still there.<p>No more. The link now redirects to $600&#x2F;yr pricing. Support is slow and useless, there are now industry-standard obnoxious sales reps, where none is needed, and so Digicert is all but Symantec now.

I&#x27;ve had a senior level title. All of my performance reviews have been positive and I don&#x27;t have trouble doing the work. My current CTO said that I was one of the smartest developers on our team of 20. I got similar feedback from colleagues at my last company and I was promoted there 4 times in 3 years. I blog regularly about programming, including posts that have been on the front page of Hacker News. I spoke at a conference this year. I have a decent amount of work on Github, including some contributions to well known open source projects.<p>I feel like the numbers for this job search are not good but I can&#x27;t figure out what the problem is. A large majority of the companies rejected me without an interview, either sending a form letter or not response at all. There hasn&#x27;t been any feedback about why they&#x27;re not interested in me. This has been especially true of larger, more well-known companies. I&#x27;m completely qualified on paper but there&#x27;s no interest.<p>I&#x27;ve also started to lose confidence for technical interviews. They feel so arbitrary. Some times I do really well. Sometimes not. But in both cases, I don&#x27;t feel like my skills have been tested or demonstrated. When I do well, the stars lined up and when I don&#x27;t, they didn&#x27;t.

you are reading this you probably know what I’m getting at. People who are grounded in reality ( according to my definition of course) are rare and may often be lost among the sea of the deluded masses. So this post of mine is an attempt to gather people who are like-minded.( people who I deem to be grounded in reality through my own colored lens of the world). The idea is to form mutually beneficial alliances in this insane world. Right now this process of forming alliances is somewhat unplanned and subject to chance events(you meet&#x2F;know someone reasonable at school, work etc.). I&#x27;m hoping to cast the net wide by leveraging the internet. As to what exactly should the alliance be, or what it hopes to achieve is something to be discussed (though I have some concrete preliminary thoughts).<p>How to start: Email me your core beliefs ( though I personally prefer a voice chat with on Skype, google hangouts etc.), especially the beliefs where you think you differ fundamentally from the vast majority of people. I will quiz you on various subjects ( and so can you) to see if our beliefs align. Overall my beliefs can be loosely labeled as: generally anarchist (i.e a live and let live approach), generally anti-authoritarian ( meaning I believe govt&#x2F;authorities do not protect your interests), largely capitalist( i.e vehemently opposed to coercive co-operation, put forth by typical socialism) etc. Perhaps at the bare minimum we have to share a meta belief that it is necessary to reach out and cooperate with other like minded individuals as it is virtually impossible to &#x27;de-delude&#x27; the idiotic masses though arguments&#x2F;dialogs etc. My email address can be found on my profile. In my profile you will also find a link to some webpages that outline my beliefs.<p>After this step, if we think our beliefs align, I will add you to an an online forum ( zero people as of now) , where you can interact with other people that I will be screening.<p>Caveats:<p>-It often takes a very long time ( months to years) to form mutually beneficial alliances. ( more so when individuals are geographically isolated from each other.) Perseverance and patience will be very important.<p>-The online forum is not to rant against the world, or a place to discuss your core beliefs. ( I would think forums for that already exist). This is more of a place for doers.<p>Side note: It’s really hard to for me to believe that someone else is not doing this ( i.e what I’m attempting in this post) already somewhere. Let me know if you are aware of similar efforts, I would be eager to join.<p>For the critics - do not assume that I&#x27;m naive. While certain specifics can be commented&#x2F;criticized, giving me moral&#x2F;philosophical advice is not welcome. I&#x27;m _not_ looking for it.","time":1574445118,"title":"Somebody had to do this.

What this report totally overlooked was the people who designed and implemented this complex system.<p>Yesterday, I watched an interview[2] with a former Iran&#x27;s &quot;National information network&quot; project employee, claiming his intentions was to improve the security of the country in general but he is deeply unhappy that it has helped the government to shut off the Internet while killing people.<p>As a developer and a security expert myself working for a private sector company in Iran there is almost no day in my life without thinking about the morality of my work. I have never (or even intended to) work on projects like &quot;National information network&quot; or other similar projects.<p>Alas the problem does not end here. In a country with all the infrastructures controlled by government, naturally most of our customers are important government-affiliated organizations. Because of our company&#x27;s position and considering the NDAs, the developers are not supposed to know the customers. Alas, this is just theory. I know a lot of our customers and some of them are pretty bad, very very bad, with bloody hands even in this weeks suppressions.<p>I don&#x27;t think our product is used for killing people, but what if it indirectly aids those organizations to achieve their nasty goals?

We make it easy to instantly verify photo IDs. Our goal is to empower platforms to accurately identify their users while being responsible stewards of sensitive information.<p>Today, we’re launching our self-service ID checks (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.berbix.com&#x2F;pricing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.berbix.com&#x2F;pricing</a>) to organizations of any size that need to answer the question: Are you who you say you are?<p>We’re taking a privacy-first approach to identity verification. Your government-issued photo ID is one of the most sensitive pieces of information you own, and sharing it with a company online can be scary. We’ve invested significant effort to try to do this the right way from a security perspective, ensuring all images that ever leave our system are aggressively watermarked, and enforcing short retention policies to automatically purge data. We aren’t—nor do we ever intend to be—in the business of selling personal data.<p>Unless you’re a credit card processor, everyone knows that you’d be crazy to collect credit card numbers directly without using a system like Stripe because of PCI compliance. But there’s no equivalent standard for identity documents. It’s still the wild west when it comes to best practices around this extremely sensitive data. Companies inevitably will need to collect this data, whether to comply with regulations to verify age, confirm the identity of a GDPR or CCPA request, or deter fraud on a marketplace.  It may come across as self serving, but we’d rather have a privacy-oriented company collect that data on their behalf.<p>We were the product and engineering leaders of the Trust &amp; Safety team at Airbnb for several years where we were tasked with stopping all bad things from happening on Airbnb—both online and offline. This was a challenging problem as it included your typical online fraud like chargebacks, account takeovers, and wire scams in addition to much more novel offline risks like property damage and personal safety issues.<p>We learned to distinguish between “premeditated” bad actors who come to a platform with the intent to cause harm and “opportunistic” bad actors who would swipe a $20 bill on a nightstand, as an example. Some techniques work well against one group, but not the other. One effective means to fight both is to check a government-issued photo ID. Premeditated bad actors will often leave to find another platform with fewer protections, and opportunistic bad actors will think twice before doing something malicious in the moment when they know their ID has been checked.<p>Historically, checking IDs online has been hard. It required a 5-figure contract with a legacy ID verification provider, would take minutes or more, and the quality of the data returned left a lot to be desired. We knew there had to be a better way, and so we started Berbix. Our product returns a result in 2 seconds or less and leverages the machine- and human-readable components of a photo ID to maximize accuracy.<p>We’ve designed Berbix in a way that we, as developers, would want to use it (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.berbix.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.berbix.com</a>), with backend API libraries that make an integration simple and intuitive. We offer client-side SDKs for a number of platforms including React, iOS, Android and more (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;berbix\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;berbix</a>). We make integration simple enough to be completed in a matter of minutes, while also providing flexibility to offer custom configurations if desired. Using our API, you can request the information you need to verify your users, while isolating your servers from ever handling the sensitive user-submitted ID images directly.<p>We’d love feedback from the HN community. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!","time":1574359202,"title":"Launch HN: Berbix (YC S18) – Instant ID checks to fight fraud and stay compliant","type":"story"},{"by":"ilamont","descendants":98,"id":21597101,"kids":[21597697,21597889,21597552,21597869,21600162,21599621,21597866,21598407,21600329,21600455,21597893,21599897,21599818,21599587,21597633,21598544,21600454,21599894,21599630,21598568,21600236,21602182,21598357,21601758,21599768,21597991,21600191,21599205],"score":122,"time":1574358939,"title":"Marie Kondo betrays her whole premise by launching e-commerce store full of junk","type":"story","url":"https://news.avclub.com/marie-kondo-betrays-her-whole-premise-by-launching-e-co-1839960688"},{"by":"joebaf","descendants":6,"id":21597081,"kids":[21597281,21601873,21605288],"score":20,"time":1574358833,"title":"How C++17 Benefits from Boost Libraries","type":"story","url":"https://www.fluentcpp.com/2019/11/19/how-c17-benefits-from-boost-libraries-part-one/"},{"by":"sheepybloke","descendants":19,"id":21597053,"kids":[21598423,21597319,21597755,21599179,21598035,21619377,21606132,21597303,21598361,21601764,21601229,21597429,21597533,21597974,21601073,21597925],"score":37,"text":"I&#x27;m working with a team who are working on a professional ballet company, focusing mainly on performances.

you probably know what I’m getting at. People who are grounded in reality ( according to my definition of course) are rare and may often be lost among the sea of the deluded masses. So this post of mine is an attempt to gather people who are like-minded.( people who I deem to be grounded in reality through my own colored lens of the world). The idea is to form mutually beneficial alliances in this insane world. Right now this process of forming alliances is somewhat unplanned and subject to chance events(you meet&#x2F;know someone reasonable at school, work etc.). I&#x27;m hoping to cast the net wide by leveraging the internet. As to what exactly should the alliance be, or what it hopes to achieve is something to be discussed (though I have some concrete preliminary thoughts).<p>How to start: Email me your core beliefs ( though I personally prefer a voice chat with on Skype, google hangouts etc.), especially the beliefs where you think you differ fundamentally from the vast majority of people. I will quiz you on various subjects ( and so can you) to see if our beliefs align. Overall my beliefs can be loosely labeled as: generally anarchist (i.e a live and let live approach), generally anti-authoritarian ( meaning I believe govt&#x2F;authorities do not protect your interests), largely capitalist( i.e vehemently opposed to coercive co-operation, put forth by typical socialism) etc. Perhaps at the bare minimum we have to share a meta belief that it is necessary to reach out and cooperate with other like minded individuals as it is virtually impossible to &#x27;de-delude&#x27; the idiotic masses though arguments&#x2F;dialogs etc. My email address can be found on my profile. In my profile you will also find a link to some webpages that outline my beliefs.<p>After this step, if we think our beliefs align, I will add you to an an online forum ( zero people as of now) , where you can interact with other people that I will be screening.<p>Caveats:<p>-It often takes a very long time ( months to years) to form mutually beneficial alliances. ( more so when individuals are geographically isolated from each other.) Perseverance and patience will be very important.<p>-The online forum is not to rant against the world, or a place to discuss your core beliefs. ( I would think forums for that already exist). This is more of a place for doers.<p>Side note: It’s really hard to for me to believe that someone else is not doing this ( i.e what I’m attempting in this post) already somewhere.

We’re Tom and Pasha, co-founders of InsideSherpa (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.insidesherpa.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.insidesherpa.com&#x2F;</a>). Our website hosts online courses (which we call ‘virtual experiences’) that allow any college student to learn from companies for free, and then get hired by them. These courses are created by companies like JPMorgan Chase [1], General Electric [2], Deloitte[3], Citibank [4] and Latham &amp; Watkins [5].<p>There are many talented and determined college students who get overlooked during the hiring process because of arbitrary measures like what university they went to, how their resume was written, or by not having any connections into a company.<p>Tom and I saw this in our corporate careers—we used to work in law and big 4 accounting—and spent a lot of free time helping disadvantaged students improve their resumes. We found that with a bit of editing, skill-building and some exposure to people from big companies, we could increase the likelihood that someone would get an interview and land a job at a big organization. After doing this process manually day-in and day-out we thought there had to be a way to improve employment outcomes for students, at scale!<p>So we started InsideSherpa and decided to take a student-centric approach to understanding the recruitment process. To do this, we talked to tons of students and found consistent anxieties arose: 1. Students were anxious about choosing a career for the next 5 years of their life (and do it in a risk-free manner) 2. Students weren’t sure if they had the skills to be useful to employers (usually when they actually did have the skills) and 3. Many students felt like the big companies were so inaccessible to them they didn’t even consider applying at all.<p>On top of this, we’ve found many large companies tend to only visit a tiny percentage of the campuses in the US. This meant many talented students we met, in more isolated or non-target universities, weren’t even getting a shot to apply for a job.<p>To solve these problems, we created our “Virtual Experience Programs”. These are like an online course, but instead of teaching you theory, like they do at college or in MOOCs, you receive tasks that simulate what professionals do in industry. For example, one task in our JPMorgan Chase Software Engineering program is to quickly update a Python script to find the average of two financial data feeds—something junior software engineers actually do with traders. Other tasks on our platform allow students to build practical skills in law, mechanical engineering, management consulting and investment banking.<p>By doing the Virtual Experience Programs, students can get their name and profile onto a CRM that our partner clients are using for early-talent reachout and hiring. JPMorgan Chase prioritizes its Virtual Experience participants for review in the application process for software engineering summer internships and full-time roles. Students can always opt-out of sharing their data with any firm at any time as well.<p>Our programs are free for any college student to do. We make money by charging employers rather than students. Employers love what we do as it allows them to reach out and find college students who genuinely want to pursue a career in their field, no matter who they are or where they are.<p>We’d love to hear your thoughts on how we can make the hiring process better for college students!<p>[1] The JPMorgan Chase Software Engineering Virtual Experience: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.insidesherpa.com&#x2F;virtual-internships&#x2F;prototype&#x2F;R5iK7HMxJGBgaSbvk&#x2F;Technology%20Virtual%20Experience\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.insidesherpa.com&#x2F;virtual-internships&#x2F;prototype&#x2F;R...</a><p>[2] General Electric Program: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.insidesherpa.com&#x2F;virtual-internships&#x2F;prototype&#x2F;EhPoi4AiGigk4CJKq&#x2F;Global-Leadership-Program\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.insidesherpa.com&#x2F;virtual-internships&#x2F;prototype&#x2F;E...</a><p>[3]  Deloitte Program: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.insidesherpa.com&#x2F;virtual-internships&#x2F;prototype&#x2F;FqFtWwQzNxJ8Qsh5H&#x2F;Technology%20Consulting\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.insidesherpa.com&#x2F;virtual-internships&#x2F;prototype&#x2F;F...</a><p>[4] Citibank Program: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.insidesherpa.com&#x2F;virtual-internships&#x2F;prototype&#x2F;icdo6cFXmnQtb8WLK&#x2F;Virtual-Banking-Program\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.insidesherpa.com&#x2F;virtual-internships&#x2F;prototype&#x2F;i...</a><p>[5] Latham &amp; Watkins (Law) Program: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.insidesherpa.com&#x2F;virtual-internships&#x2F;prototype&#x2F;jDTDRBDa5XfECcEk9&#x2F;LathamWatkins-Mergers-Acquisitions-Virtual-Experience-Program\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.insidesherpa.com&#x2F;virtual-internships&#x2F;prototype&#x2F;j...</a>","time":1574282502,"title":"Launch HN: InsideSherpa (YC W19) – online courses to train then hire students","type":"story"},{"by":"shadowfaxRodeo","descendants":5,"id":21588281,"kids":[21589096,21621451,21591886,21592248],"score":17,"text":"I&#x27;ve been soaking up a lot of web development talks recently, mostly from tech conferences&#x27; you tube channels. \nSome of these talks are great and only have about 50 views.

Then the second offshore gets excited and writes that not only can they do that, but they can improve the signup flow by ditching social login for Twilio login with the additional two attributes of used car price and used car color as personal identifiers in the login process (wtf).<p>I asked for none of this. I made a very simple request (I think). Some days I feel like a comedy routine is going on, other days I feel like I&#x27;m being gaslit.

Kape Technologies is a huge company that also owns the likes of CyberGhost and Zenmate. I decided to read more and found facts that thoroughly shocked me:<p>1. CyberGhost was acquired by Kape Technologies(previously named Crossrider) back in 2017. Crosrider was known to hide malware&#x2F;adware in their software and then sell data collected by it.<p>2. The co-founder of Kape Technologies, Teddy Sagi was sentenced to prison in regards to fraud and bribery back in 1996.<p>3. CyberGhost was also found to have WebRTC, IPv6 as well as DNS leaks multiple times, risking its users’ privacy.<p>4. Private Internet Access hired Mark Karpeles (ex-CEO of MT.Gox BitCoin platform) as their CTO. Karpeles was arrested and found guilty when tampering with financial records, trying to hide the platform’s loss by combining his personal finances with the exchange’s.<p>5. Private Internet Access’s founder Andrew Lee, also known as Rasengan on HackerNews, made serious allegations against ProtonVPN.<p>6. Allegations against NordVPN followed, where PIA’s employee was caught sharing a misleading PDF as a ‘concerned citizen’.<p>7. An ex-employee of PIA was threatened due to disclosing management issues, therefore spilling a lot of information about the company.<p>8. The same employee disclosed that PIA faked Reddit comments and ordered to downvote negative feedback about the product.<p>9.Another thing to consider is that before acquisition, Private Internet Access was in debt of over $32 million.<p>The facts about these companies were easy to find, to be honest, I didn’t need to dig deep to find them. I am just truthfully shocked about this and how much I didn’t know about the companies beforehand.

In fact, they often create even more stress when you&#x27;re staring at a list 100 items longs.<p>Slash is a task &quot;do-er&quot; that helps you CRUSH your list by focusing on one task at a time.<p>Quickly enter your tasks, hit &#x27;Start&#x27;, and the window shrinks down to a small always-on-top window that shows your current task and how long you&#x27;ve been working on it. When you&#x27;re done, hover over the task name and click &#x27;Done&#x27;. Then you get a random &quot;&quot;You&#x27;re awesome&quot;&quot; GIF, and the option to start the next task, or take a break. The idea is that you create your list once in the morning, and then never have to choose what to do next.<p>It also bakes in a ton of other productivity tools like:<p>- Pomodoros (20-30 minute work periods with 5 minute breaks) \n- Eisenhower Matrix (Tagging tasks as urgent&#x2F;important for automatic prioritisation) \n- Timed Tasks (Type in &#x27;Do _______ for 20 minutes&#x27; and the task will start with a 20 minute countdown) \n- Time Tracking (Check out the analytics dashboard to see what you spent the most time on, your most productive days + hours, etc) \n- Integrations with Trello, Asana, Todoist, etc. -- Coming soon!

We&#x27;re excited to start sharing this first version of our Android App and getting your feedback.<p>While technology has made our lives easier and more manageable in many ways, it is just in the last 10 years that we have seen its impact in helping citizens organize protests around causes to achieve change faster. \nA few years ago we saw how social media was key in global movements to achieve more democracy in certain countries. As social media has been censored and used against citizens we think we&#x27;ll see more hard-to-censor technology products being used by mobilized citizens.<p>Looking at hundreds of campaigns over the last century, Erica Chenoweth, a political scientist at Harvard University, found that nonviolent campaigns are twice as likely to achieve their goals as violent campaigns. She has shown that it takes around 3.5% of the population actively participating in the protests to ensure serious political change.<p>Over the past few months, we’ve been building a set of civic technology tools to empower citizens to organize more efficiently and achieve change faster. This week we’ve launched and tested the first version of our Android app in Catalonia. It has successfully helped tens of thousands of Catalans to protest by blocking the Pyrenees border highway with concerts, dinners, and camps.<p>Join us as we build and test #civictech in Catalonia to empower its citizens to protest peacefully and effectively towards change.<p>If you have questions, we’ll be here to answer them. We’d love any feedback, ideas and comments.

Convictional makes it possible for online retailers to find, onboard, and integrate with third-party suppliers. We do this by connecting them to a network of suppliers that manage the inventory and ship those products directly to the end consumer on their behalf.<p>The idea behind Convictional started when Roger worked at GNC, a large natural health products retailer, at the age of 17. One of the biggest challenges was onboarding. As a retailer, you either buy inventory or ship from third parties (&quot;drop shipping&quot;). They decided to expand their catalog by selling some products that were shipped directly by the supplier. To do this, GNC required both sides to implement EDI (an old school, pre-internet data format for exchanging information between business systems) or manually exchange flat files for things like inventory, orders, and product information. We only got a fraction of the total vendors we wanted to onboarded because of this.<p>A few years later, we met while working together at Shopify on B2B. There, we saw that the challenge of onboarding third-party brands still existed for retailers, and people were experiencing the same pain trying to use EDI to get it done. Online retailers also didn’t know how to find third-party brands to work with or struggled to dropship with existing partners.<p>Convictional’s product is an app and API that syncs product information, inventory, orders, fulfillments, and payouts between online retailers and all of their suppliers. We do this by integrating with the systems used on both sides through an API or pre-built connectors to ecommerce platforms like Shopify. We later added a way to find suppliers after online retailers told us that they also wanted to access a network of connected third-party brands.<p>We’re using a generalized data model in the middle with a bunch of mapping, transformation and transmission steps on each side. Similar to what EDI does but much easier to set up. The goal is to turn what today requires a 6 month IT project into an email invite and an app install. It’s an industry that has existed since the 60s, and it’s probably the last major software industry that touches commerce but has not meaningfully been updated.<p>To do this we developed our own queueing system in Go that can map events from buyers and sellers, transform them from the source format into the destination format, validate and apply a bunch of domain-specific business logic to make sure what crosses the bounds of buyers and sellers actually makes sense, and then send those into another queue that passes it to their partner. We basically have to control the state of three systems for each transaction. Before us, it could take up to 24 hours to know whether that loop succeeded or not but we’re able to do it within a few seconds. There are a lot of real life things that enables, but mostly it enables a good experience for the buyer’s ultimate consumers and less inventory for both sides.<p>Our belief is that online retailers will be less inclined to take on inventory. That’s why we started by building the tooling necessary to automate dropship. Over time, we’ll launch tools that can enable more forms of B2B trade in a way where regardless of IT skills, both sides can have systems doing their purchasing and selling for them. Today large companies enjoy significant advantages through this integrated approach, and soon every buyer and seller can too.<p>Brands and suppliers can join our seller network for free. If you make or sell physical products on an ecommerce platform, consider joining. For online retailers, we charge a flat monthly fee and a percentage of GMV, depending on volume and which work gets outsourced to us.<p>If you have questions, we’ll be here to answer them. We’d love any feedback, ideas, and&#x2F;or EDI horror stories that you may have as well.

People who are grounded in reality ( according to my definition of course) are rare and may often be lost among the sea of the deluded masses. So this post of mine is an attempt to gather people who are like-minded.( people who I deem to be grounded in reality through my own colored lens of the world). The idea is to form mutually beneficial alliances in this insane world. Right now this process of forming alliances is somewhat unplanned and subject to chance events(you meet&#x2F;know someone reasonable at school, work etc.). I&#x27;m hoping to cast the net wide by leveraging the internet. As to what exactly should the alliance be, or what it hopes to achieve is something to be discussed (though I have some concrete preliminary thoughts).<p>How to start: Email me your core beliefs ( though I personally prefer a voice chat with on Skype, google hangouts etc.), especially the beliefs where you think you differ fundamentally from the vast majority of people. I will quiz you on various subjects ( and so can you) to see if our beliefs align. Overall my beliefs can be loosely labeled as: generally anarchist (i.e a live and let live approach), generally anti-authoritarian ( meaning I believe govt&#x2F;authorities do not protect your interests), largely capitalist( i.e vehemently opposed to coercive co-operation, put forth by typical socialism) etc. Perhaps at the bare minimum we have to share a meta belief that it is necessary to reach out and cooperate with other like minded individuals as it is virtually impossible to &#x27;de-delude&#x27; the idiotic masses though arguments&#x2F;dialogs etc. My email address can be found on my profile. In my profile you will also find a link to some webpages that outline my beliefs.<p>After this step, if we think our beliefs align, I will add you to an an online forum ( zero people as of now) , where you can interact with other people that I will be screening.<p>Caveats:<p>-It often takes a very long time ( months to years) to form mutually beneficial alliances. ( more so when individuals are geographically isolated from each other.) This is not a quick fix for your immediate problems, or for people without perseverance.<p>-The online forum is not to rant against the world, or a place to discuss your core beliefs. This is more of a place for doers not ivory tower thinkers.<p>Side note: It’s really hard to for me to believe that someone else is not doing this ( i.e what I’m attempting in this post) already somewhere.

Curious to hear what others founders think of this subject&#x2F; how you guys handle this","time":1573994000,"title":"Ask HN: How do you manage corporate formalities for your companies?","type":"story"},{"by":"tosh","descendants":5,"id":21557558,"kids":[21566369,21565038,21564975],"score":73,"time":1573991746,"title":"Hokusai: Old man, crazy to paint (2017)","type":"story","url":"https://www.1843magazine.com/culture/look-closer/hokusai-old-man-crazy-to-paint"},{"by":"fredley","descendants":11,"id":21557607,"kids":[21558092,21558087,21558213,21559796,21560162,21560308,21558072],"score":18,"time":1573992862,"title":"The £7,500 dress that does not exist","type":"story","url":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49794403"},{"by":"badrabbit","descendants":2,"id":21557476,"kids":[21557489,21558869],"score":3,"time":1573989999,"title":"Tell HN:Google charging a large fee for Maps API as a result GeoGuess is removed","type":"story","url":"https://imgur.com/gallery/ZuWMooq"},{"by":"lelf","descendants":101,"id":21557469,"kids":[21562998,21563406,21563214,21566537,21565098,21567551,21562983,21567500,21567487,21566148,21571620,21562943,21563203,21564933,21567382,21563094,21559101,21565844,21566217,21564011,21564171,21558560,21563332,21565675],"score":161,"time":1573989920,"title":"Colossal Holograms","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/through-the-looking-glass/colossal-holograms-b7f86f5925bd"},{"by":"pseudolus","descendants":4,"id":21557458,"kids":[21558435,21558339],"score":7,"time":1573989623,"title":"FedEx Cut Its Tax Bill to $0","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/business/how-fedex-cut-its-tax-bill-to-0.html"},{"by":"vinnyglennon","descendants":8,"id":21557523,"kids":[21567105,21567037,21568586,21567591],"score":29,"time":1573991021,"title":"Taming Large Rails Applications with Private ActiveRecord Models","type":"story","url":"https://kellysutton.com/2019/10/29/taming-large-rails-codebases-with-private-activerecord-models.html"},{"by":"vinnyglennon","descendants":2,"id":21557524,"kids":[21566446,21570440],"score":52,"time":1573991023,"title":"What I learned from the first VC check I wrote","type":"story","url":"https://bothsidesofthetable.com/what-did-i-learn-from-the-first-vc-check-i-ever-wrote-f93267f52fc7"},{"by":"inception44","descendants":283,"id":21557309,"kids":[21557446,21559122,21558018,21557385,21558496,21557976,21557586,21559671,21557989,21560086,21557692,21560390,21560289,21558844,21557758,21558556,21557702,21560144,21558643,21558554,21558697],"score":571,"time":1573986328,"title":"Firefox’s Fight for the Future of the Web","type":"story","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/17/firefox-mozilla-fights-back-against-google-chrome-dominance-privacy-fears"},{"by":"rahuldottech","descendants":10,"id":21557291,"kids":[21557315,21557321,21557304,21571142,21557416,21557328,21557325],"score":25,"time":1573985772,"title":"A Selfie with a Serial Killer","type":"story","url":"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2019/11/a-selfie-with-a-serial-killer/"},{"by":"tosh","descendants":7,"id":21557310,"kids":[21558893,21557611],"score":2,"time":1573986358,"title":"Why do periods and commas go inside quotation marks in MLA style?","type":"story","url":"https://style.mla.org/punctuation-and-quotation-marks/"},{"by":"ekoutanov","descendants":1,"id":21557184,"kids":[21557431,21557307],"score":3,"time":1573982739,"title":"Oracle Pits GraalVM Against Google Go","type":"story","url":"https://www.javaworld.com/article/3440103/oracle-pits-graalvm-against-google-go.html"},{"by":"Tomte","descendants":27,"id":21557063,"kids":[21567306,21567233,21568091,21567868,21568044,21568221,21567384],"score":92,"time":1573979115,"title":"Seiko 7S26 for Novice Horologists (2012)","type":"story","url":"http://www.clockmaker.com.au/diy_seiko_7s26/"},{"by":"pjmlp","descendants":33,"id":21557057,"kids":[21557354,21557399,21557372,21558694,21557359,21559357,21557467,21559472,21561488,21557403],"score":131,"time":1573978974,"title":"Active Oberon Language Report Update 2019","type":"story","url":"http://cas.inf.ethz.ch/news/2"},{"by":"yosid","descendants":2,"id":21557023,"kids":[21557280,21557056],"score":4,"time":1573978214,"title":"We're Selling Our SaaS Company (ProveSource) on eBay","type":"story","url":"https://www.ebay.com/itm/ProveSource-1-Social-Proof-Marketing-Platform-/352857074788?t=151"},{"by":"Thevet","descendants":50,"id":21556978,"kids":[21564055,21566988,21565437,21566857,21565524,21563689,21564560,21564153],"score":70,"time":1573976790,"title":"Highs and lows of Lowell Cafe, America’s first cannabis cafe","type":"story","url":"https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/food-drink/article/3037576/highs-and-lows-lowell-cafe-americas-first-cannabis-cafe-where"},{"by":"apollinaire","descendants":11,"id":21556955,"kids":[21564570,21561426,21563249,21565495,21561823,21563528],"score":62,"time":1573975765,"title":"The Disappearance of John M.

I have an optometrist, but I am unable to go through a complete eye test because I experience vasovagal syncopes [1] from the combination of eyedrops and bright lights involved (3 times and counting).<p>I had 20&#x2F;15 vision in both eyes in my teens.  I am now in my early thirties.  My eyes started to go astigmatic after starting a programming job in my late twenties, getting worse at the rate of about 0.25 diopters every 1-2 years.  According to my optometrist, I am neither near nor farsighted.  Both eyes now have what&#x27;s called &quot;against-the-rule&quot; astigmatism, which is less common.  I can, by looking at distant street lights at night, tell that the astigmatism is correlated with time staring at a computer screen.<p>I can&#x27;t simply program less, so is there a way to &quot;stop&quot; the progression of astigmatism due to the screen viewing?  One thing I thought of is if there were a visual device that allowed the screen to appear at infinity, for example.  I have already switched to using a 65 inch television from a distance of 10 feet at home, but it doesn&#x27;t appear to help much.<p>To be clear, I experience no pain from my condition, just apprehension that it will get worse and affect my driving.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mayoclinic.org&#x2F;diseases-conditions&#x2F;vasovagal-syncope&#x2F;symptoms-causes&#x2F;syc-20350527","time":1573871391,"title":"Ask HN: Eyes failing due to programming job.

I want to apply to a program extremely similar to YC(in another country), I don&#x27;t know if this is the best use of my time and resources.<p>I&#x27;m fairly confident in my ability to build a good product and to market it decently, I&#x27;m not so confident about my ability to convince investors, pitching and powerpoints aren&#x27;t part of my strengths for now, also I don&#x27;t think I look really good on paper, I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m good at what I&#x27;m doing, but convincing investors of this could to be hard.<p>My goal isn&#x27;t really to launch a huge company, so I don&#x27;t know if this could cause a lot of issues when dealing with investors, I don&#x27;t know if I should try to hide or minimize this when looking for funding, or maybe try other forms of funding(crowdfunding, loans etc...)<p>I agree with Paul Graham who said on Lecture 3 of &quot;How to create a startup&quot;, that launching a startup(especially a would-be unicorn) at my age is probably a bad idea, that it&#x27;s too soon to potentially dedicate a decade of your life to your project if it gain traction, and that you should probably &quot;live&quot; a bit first(travel, trying different things..).<p>So my goal is mostly to be able to work on an interesting project that I chose while being &quot;relatively free&quot; in how I work, and maybe if I&#x27;m lucky reach &quot;financial freedom&quot; in a few years, but I don&#x27;t think that aiming to build a unicorn would be an optimal choice.<p>What would you do if you were in my position?","time":1573847301,"title":"Ask HN: Should you find funding for your startup if you're freelancing to live?","type":"story"},{"by":"wglb","descendants":83,"id":21547945,"kids":[21562145,21562027,21562864,21548319,21562102,21563665,21563351,21562317,21562002,21562510,21562428,21562034,21563954,21563821,21561902,21564375],"score":148,"time":1573846193,"title":"A Black Hole Threw a Star Out of the Milky Way Galaxy","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/science/stars-black-hole-milky-way.html"},{"by":"yamrzou","descendants":12,"id":21547958,"kids":[21548381,21548198,21549705,21548266],"score":80,"time":1573846280,"title":"The Measure of Intelligence: towards more human-like artificial systems","type":"story","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547"},{"by":"matejmecka","descendants":1,"id":21547920,"kids":[21548034,21557143],"score":14,"time":1573846018,"title":"The Supreme Court Will Hear Google and Oracle’s Case","type":"story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/15/20946398/oracle-google-java-copyright-lawsuit-trial-supreme-court-request"},{"by":"l31g","descendants":37,"id":21547850,"kids":[21559942,21560132,21550644,21552551,21560994,21560081,21559945,21549970,21561287,21561372],"score":98,"time":1573845650,"title":"NUVIA: New Server CPU Startup Going After Intel and AMD","type":"story","url":"https://www.anandtech.com/show/15115/nuvia-breaks-cover-new-startup-to-take-on-datacenter-cpu-market"},{"by":"stygiansonic","descendants":548,"id":21547659,"kids":[21550422,21548270,21549501,21548792,21548229,21548798,21548585,21548671,21550608,21548240,21548586,21548292,21547932,21552459,21550409,21548335,21549271,21551133,21549054,21550867,21552277,21551768,21548337,21548560,21550012,21548615,21551228,21548344,21550697,21550019,21550025,21548707,21548273],"score":416,"time":1573844524,"title":"Google cancels TGIF weekly all-hands meetings","type":"story","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/15/google-cancels-tgif-weekly-all-hands-meetings.html"},{"by":"rschnalzer","descendants":1,"id":21547486,"kids":[21547530,21547622],"score":2,"time":1573843413,"title":"Column: It’s called Earnin.

Since you are reading this you probably know what I’m getting at. People who are grounded in reality are rare and may often be lost among the sea of the deluded masses( I&#x27;m one of them). So this post of mine is an attempt to gather people who are like-minded.( people who I deem to be grounded in reality through my own colored lens of the world). The idea is to form mutually beneficial alliances in this insane world. As to how exactly this is to be achieved is something to be discussed ( though I have some concrete preliminary thoughts ).<p>How to start: Email me your core beliefs ( though I personally prefer a voice chat with on Skype, google hangouts etc.), especially the beliefs where you think you differ fundamentally from the vast majority of people. I will quiz you on various subjects ( and so can you) to see if our beliefs align. Overall my beliefs can be loosely labeled as: generally anarchist (i.e a live and let live approach), generally anti-authoritarian ( meaning  I believe govt&#x2F;authorities do not protect your interests), largely capitalist( i.e vehemently opposed to coercive co-operation, put forth by typical socialism) etc. Perhaps at the bare minimum we have to share a meta belief that it is necessary to reach out and cooperate with other like minded individuals as it is virtually impossible to &#x27;de-delude&#x27; the idiotic masses though arguments&#x2F;dialogs etc. My email address can be found on my profile. In my profile you will also find a link to some webpages that outline my beliefs.<p>After this step, if we think our beliefs align, I will add you to an an online forum ( zero people as of now) , where you can interact with other people that I will be screening.<p>Caveats:<p>-It often takes a very long time ( months to years) to form mutually beneficial alliances. ( more so when individuals are geographically isolated from each other.) This is not a quick fix for your immediate problems, or for people without perseverance.<p>-The online forum is not to rant against the world, or a place to discuss your core beliefs. This is more of a place for doers not ivory tower thinkers.<p>It’s really hard to for me to believe that someone else is not doing this ( i.e what I’m attempting in this post) already somewhere.

The reason is that past success in transactional business has biased tech industry towards solutions that are transactional. Education is anything but transactional, unless you count selling books as education.<p>The success of past has put a filter which prevents good eductech companies.<p>Education is a workflow that spans easily months or years to be effective. A good startup in this area would avoid being transactional, instead it would learn from success of another tech process that is long drawn. That is making good software. The kinds of process that helps to make software development more effective are the kinds of process that would make long drawn learning process effective.<p>This begins with github for learning lessons which allow people to collaboratively create learning lessons.

work as an independent software consultant in a somewhat specialized area. A friend recently introduced me to the founders of a company that are looking for help in this area. It&#x27;s interesting work and I want to pursue it. However, my friend is insisting that I bill his company at my rate of $X&#x2F;hr, and he bill them at $1.25X&#x2F;hr. The client appears to be fine with the rate he quoted them.<p>I understand that business is all about relationships, and I want my friend to be compensated for the value that he&#x27;s provided. However, this seems pretty steep to me, especially if it turns into a long term engagement. In my experience, recruiters usually charge a one time fee, but his reasoning is that he&#x27;s more of a staffing agency than a recruiter.<p>While theoretically I should be content with earning my rate, this has also made me realize that I should be charging more.<p>One possibility I&#x27;m thinking about is that we engage under his terms for a short term initial contract, after which point I start billing the client directly, either at my current rate or at his. However, I&#x27;m not sure how this might be received by both the client and my friend, nor what the norms are in this type of situation.<p>What does HN think?

People who are grounded in reality are rare and may often be lost among the sea of the deluded masses( I&#x27;m one of them).  So this post of mine is an attempt to gather people who are like-minded.( people who I deem to be grounded in reality through my own colored lens of the world). The idea is to form mutually beneficial alliances in this insane world.\nAs to how exactly this is to be achieved is something to be discussed ( though I have some concrete preliminary thoughts ).<p>How to start:\nEmail me your core beliefs ( though I personally prefer a voice chat with on Skype, google hangouts etc.), especially the beliefs where you think you differ fundamentally from the vast majority of people. I will quiz you on various subjects ( and so can you) to see if our beliefs align. Perhaps  at the bare minimum we have to share meta belief that it is necessary to reach out and cooperate with other like minded individuals as it is virtually impossible to ‘de-delude’ the idiotic masses though arguments&#x2F;discussions etc.\nMy email address can be found on my profile. In my profile you will also find a link to some webpages that outline my beliefs.<p>After this step, if we think our beliefs align, I will add you to an an online forum ( zero people as of now) , where you can interact with other people that I will be screening.<p>Caveats:<p>-It often takes a very long time ( months to years) to form mutually beneficial alliances. ( more so when individuals are geographically isolated from each other.) This is not a quick fix for your immediate problems, or for people without perseverance.<p>-The online forum is not to rant against the world, or a place to discuss your core beliefs.

DNS was easy to see and manipulate, and that was a problem once it left the private network - it enabled ISP&#x27;s and other close-hop providers to catch a glimpse of what is being viewed online.<p>Inside the private network it was great because it could be detected and manipulated as necessary - redirecting rogue DNS queries to the desired DNS servers if specific software and apps were attempting to use their own hard-coded DNS servers (to bypass ad-blocking etc.), blocking unwanted domains and sites, etc.<p>Using Pi-Hole my current DNS request block percentage is 45.8%. I specifically redirect DNS requests through it using firewall rules. If I remove or disable the DNS redirection firewall rule this percentage falls to around 25 - 30%, meaning that there are a number of internal devices and software that are using specific, custom DNS servers rather than what my DHCP server hands out.  I don&#x27;t like that, but vanilla DNS lets me close that potential security hole.<p>What if these devices and software start using internal DNS over HTTPS (or any of the other forms of non-inspectable or non-specific-DNS-port DNS requests) settings that are non-configurable?<p>How do we even detect that it&#x27;s occurring, never mind being able to manipulate it to comply with the
