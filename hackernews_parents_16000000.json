We&#x27;re Rohan and David, founders of Temper (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.temperapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.temperapp.com</a>).<p>Temper is a desktop app we built to help gamers get more sleep by blocking games at night. You can set a schedule (eg. no games after 11pm) or set a daily time limit (eg. no more than 2 hours of gaming per day) and once you hit those limits, Temper will block you from playing more games until the next day.  We know nobody wants to get blocked in the middle of a game and get an abandon, so unlike most blockers, Temper is game-aware and uses traditional computer vision (specifically, blob detection to identify elements) to ensure the block only activates once a game ends.<p>We started Temper because we&#x27;re gamers ourselves (over 5k hours of Dota 2 between us!) and believe games are positive experiences that can help you de-stress and keep in touch with friends. But we also realized that we regularly stayed up late at night playing just &quot;one more game&quot; instead of getting a healthy amount of sleep. After surveying other gamers and looking at the research, we discovered this was a really common phenomenon, with international studies reporting that 9% of gamers overuse video games. So we decided to build Temper to help people (and ourselves) maintain a healthier relationship with gaming.<p>If you&#x27;re a gamer who struggles with the same issue, please check us out and tell us what you think! It&#x27;s Windows only for now and we support League of Legends, Dota 2, Heroes of the Storm, Overwatch, PUBG and Hearthstone. We&#x27;re adding new games every week so if you have any requests let us know.","time":1519926825,"title":"Launch HN: Temper (YC W18) – Get more sleep by blocking games at night","type":"story"},{"by":"sergeant3","descendants":41,"id":16494280,"kids":[16511954,16496955,16511180,16513679,16511412,16511227,16511468,16514465,16514644,16515385,16512478,16513068,16514735,16511775],"score":337,"time":1519926388,"title":"The Lottery Hackers","type":"story","url":"http://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/lotto-winners/"},{"by":"moh_maya","descendants":9,"id":16494161,"kids":[16495298,16495253,16495579],"score":33,"time":1519925768,"title":"BBC adapting Terry Pratchett’s iconic Discworld books for six-part TV series","type":"story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/1/17066844/terry-pratchett-discworld-books-tv-adapation-the-watch"},{"by":"ohjeez","descendants":85,"id":16494028,"kids":[16494283,16495040,16494521,16494224,16495302,16495550,16495213,16494296,16494363,16494286,16494116,16498100,16497773,16498747,16496383,16495838,16494838,16494971,16495126,16499951,16495134,16496676,16496444,16499883,16494695,16495037,16496748,16495989,16494902,16498284,16498768,16494151,16496184],"score":149,"time":1519925118,"title":"Paper is dead, long live paper programming","type":"story","url":"http://www.sacrideo.us/paper-is-dead-long-live-paper-programming/"},{"by":"ai_ia","descendants":3,"id":16494024,"kids":[16494474,16498355,16499669],"score":3,"text":"I am a starting a startup.

We automate data entry for inspectors by replacing stacks of paper with tablets and by generating completed inspection forms, saving them almost half of their inspection time.<p>Through conversations with friends and professors in the civil engineering department at our university, we discovered that data entry and report writing can be quite a time sink for bridge inspectors. Bridges need to be inspected regularly but a great deal of inspectors are using pen, paper, and camera on site and manually entering data back at the office. Those who do use software use old, clunky applications that often require persistent internet connection in the field.<p>We figured we could build something better so we created OSIMple. There are two parts to the software. First is a mobile application that inspectors use to complete their inspections. It essentially digitizes the inspection form and keeps all the photos and notes organized. The second part is a website. Once an inspector finishes an inspection, they upload their data from the mobile app to the website where they may review and edit the inspection data and finally generate a completed inspection form as a PDF.<p>We started started selling to bridge inspectors and now our software is being used on over 400 bridges. It’s become clear that other types of inspection could benefit from our software as well. So now we’re expanding to include home inspectors. Like bridge inspectors, home inspectors often have nothing or inelegant software to help them complete their job. We aim to change that, for home inspectors and beyond.<p>Thanks for reading! We’d love to hear feedback from the HN community and any ideas or experiences you&#x27;ve had in this space.","time":1519840986,"title":"Launch HN: OSIMple (YC W18) – Automating data entry for inspectors","type":"story"},{"by":"donut2d","dead":true,"id":16485065,"kids":[16485729,16485121],"score":8,"time":1519840754,"title":"We are what we celebrate","type":"story","url":"https://blog.gitprime.com/we-are-what-we-celebrate/"},{"by":"Harj","descendants":0,"id":16485073,"kids":[16486458,16485125],"score":10,"time":1519840817,"title":"Triplebyte raises $10M for its background blind tech recruiting platform","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/28/triplebyte-has-raised-more-money-for-its-background-blind-tech-recruiting-platform/"},{"by":"aaronbrethorst","descendants":26,"id":16484863,"kids":[16485131,16485649,16485242,16485024,16484955,16484932],"score":20,"time":1519839541,"title":"Martin Shkreli May Spend 20 Years in Prison","type":"story","url":"http://fortune.com/2018/02/27/martin-shkreli-pharma-bro-prison-sentence/"},{"by":"sethbannon","descendants":54,"id":16484696,"kids":[16486315,16485005,16485472,16487689,16487043,16487148,16488173,16486871,16485789,16488395,16486363],"score":186,"time":1519838591,"title":"Washington state has passed the country’s toughest net neutrality legislation","type":"story","url":"https://www.fastcompany.com/40537222/washington-just-passed-the-countrys-toughest-net-neutrality-legislation"},{"by":"fandorin","descendants":6,"id":16484666,"kids":[16485300,16485279],"score":13,"text":"I&#x27;ve been working as a team manager (dev + QA) in huge IT corporation for almost 3 years now and I am feeling that I got stuck at this position.

I&#x27;m Chris, founder of Slite (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slite.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slite.com</a>). We’re building a tool for modern teams to write down and retrieve things that matter.<p>I&#x27;ve launched two companies in the past and basically ran them on note-taking apps. The first was a hiring SaaS and the second an on-demand fashion-delivery service, and while the two were pretty different, I needed to write down a lot of stuff: interview notes, mentoring, email and article drafts, notes on customers and so on.<p>I had this habit because notes are versatile, incredibly user-friendly, and immediate. They made up my personal knowledge base but the biggest frustration I had was sharing those with teammates. So I decided to build a note app that would work with teams from day 1.<p>This is in line with the current problems in team collaboration. A lot of people were thrilled to dump email to get on Slack, but recent conversation has shifted towards Slack killing team productivity and leading to loss of information. This topic even trended on HN a week ago: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=16355454\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=16355454</a>.<p>We’re building an asynchronous writing tool for teams to organize their work with one simple yet crucial goal in mind: make sure teams stop losing valuable information and find it more quickly. We want to remove the back and forth you have on Slack, via email or even offline to find information.<p>We use the same channels pattern as Slack, mainly because this avoids the folders structure where content is hard to find, organize and where permissions are a nightmare. But using Slite allows you to separate use cases: channel chat a la IRC or Slack to communicate instantly, Slite to write and retrieve information.<p>Another major product focus is search: existing tools such as Google Docs or Dropbox Paper make it hard to organize and navigate through content (not to mention Slack where everything get lost between cat gifs). We put huge efforts on making it seamless in Slite.<p>With these basic differences we&#x27;ve already convinced hundreds of teams and thousands of active users to switch their content over from Google Docs, Dropbox Paper or other tools. We’re now entering a new phase where we’re focusing on integrations, allowing teams to push and access their information from anywhere in their workflows.<p>It’s an exciting time and we’d love for you to check it out and give us your feedback. And we&#x27;re eager to hear your ideas in this space.

We&#x27;re Jared and Gabe (YC W18), the founders of Pagedraw (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pagedraw.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pagedraw.io</a>). Pagedraw is a UI builder that turns mockups into React code.<p>Pagedraw lets you annotate mockups with extra information (like how to connect to the backend, resize for different screens, etc.) to get full, presentational, React Components. They’re React Components just like any others, so they can be interleaved freely with handwritten ones. They don’t require any new dependencies and work well with any existing JSX build system.<p>You can import the mockups from Sketch or Figma, or draw them from scratch in Pagedraw.<p>Working as full stack devs, we constantly had to do this translation by hand. It was our least favorite part of our jobs, since the creative work had already been done by the mockup designer. It&#x27;s so repetitive and mechanical that we decided to stop hand-coding divs and css and write a program to do it instead.<p>There have been many attempts to automate this stuff in the past. For 20 years, people have been trying to solve the problem with tools like Dreamweaver, Frontpage, and so on. Broadly speaking, they tended to fall into one of two buckets, each with their own problems.  In one corner are tools like Dreamweaver, which can produce correct code but have to expose some of the underlying HTML model, making their users play a puzzle game to do something as simple as move an object around. In the other corner are freeform design tools that generate position:absolute code.  That doesn’t work if you care about working on different screen sizes, or reflowing the layout around variable-length content as simple as “hello &lt;username&gt;”.<p>We think the problem is that you have to look at it like a compiler. Past tools never fully worked because they tried to unify two fundamentally different mental models: the designer’s mental model of a free form canvas like Sketch or Photoshop, and the DOM’s mental model of &lt;div&gt; followed by a &lt;p&gt; followed by an &lt;img&gt; and so on. What always happens is one of two things: either the computer’s mental model is imposed on the designer, or the designer’s mental model is imposed on the computer. The former results in a clunky design tool, and the latter results in position:absolute.<p>What we do instead is recognize that these are two fundamentally different models. Designers work with Sketch by saying “put this button at this pixel”. We can let them do that and still generate flexbox code without positon:absolute, and let everything resize and reflow correctly. Pagedraw does it by inferring constraints from the relative geometries in the mockup. For example, if object A is to the right of object B, we infer it should always remain to the right, regardless of resizing or content reflowing. Sometimes, the developer does have to ask the designer about their intent regarding resizing, which is why Pagedraw also needs you to annotate that information.  We then compile those constraints, inferred and annotated, into HTML layout mechanisms like inline-block and flexbox.<p>It turns out that a lot of other nice things follow from a compiler-like architecture. For one, we separate codegen correctness from codegen prettiness by cleaning up the generated code in discrete optimization passes. Another is the ability to easily retarget for AngularJS, Backbone, React Native, and so on by just swapping the compiler backend. We even have some nice editor features that fell out from hacking a Lispy interpreter onto our internal representation.<p>We’re excited to see what you all think and hear about your experiences in this area!

I’m a journalist who wrote ‘The Lawyer, The Addict’, a story that ran in the New York Times in July.  The story was about my ex-husband, Peter, who was a high-flying powerful partner in Wilson Sonsini (the prestigious, Palo Alto-based law firm) and who died in July 2015, a drug addict. Almost everyone in his life missed the signs. The story wound up with enormous traction and was the 55th most read story in the entire paper in 2017. It also generated several threads of commentary on HN, including  https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14776864, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14931209 and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14777919.<p>I’m now writing a book based on that story for Random House. Although it is about what happened to Peter, the broader story is about the problem of substance use (and often abuse) in white-collar professions, where the users are well-off, well-educated, working long hours, often with all the outward trappings of success.<p>What can you tell me about drug use as a professional or in your profession?<p>I know there is drug use in law, finance, medicine and technology, and am hoping that some of you will be open to discussing with me what you  see and what you&#x27;ve experienced in your profession and professional environment. I’d like to use some of your comments in the book and will not know or need to know your names, so I hope you’ll feel comfortable being as candid as possible. I’m not here to make judgements, all I’m looking for is the truth about what’s going on.<p>I&#x27;m interested in whatever you can tell me about drugs you are using or observe being used in\nyour field: which drugs, what effects you see, any stories you have, any details you can share.

I&#x27;m happy to talk about that here.<p>I went to grad school 15 years ago to study math and finance &amp; earned a MS degree. I mostly worked at investment banks you’ve heard of doing quant research&#x2F;programming. I was good at it but achieved mediocre success because of bad luck and an inability to manage politics&#x2F;get promoted. Two years ago I realized how miserable I was and left. Now I’m back at school in a program focused on art and technology. My experience as a grad student is coupled with my experience leaving the finance industry.<p>I&#x27;m happy now and love my life. Other students are great and like having me around. Classes are keeping me busier than ever before. My experience coding and project managing help me get stuff done and keep stress levels low. I&#x27;m enjoying grad school more this time.<p>Within the grad-world nobody gives me a hard time about my age. However, I&#x27;ve talked to other older students who have different experiences, such as difficulty integrating into student culture or getting help from professors&#x2F;advisors.<p>Outside the grad-world things are different. People think grad school == MBA and are confused why I would leave finance to do something that does not offer the same markers of success or financial upside. Some friends are supportive but others have stopped talking to me altogether.<p>Socially it has been challenging because of the time commitment. I&#x27;m not on the same schedule as everyone else and don’t fit anyone&#x27;s model of what people do with their lives.<p>I&#x27;m curious why HN readers are curious about my experience as a student. Why is this interesting? I thought being a 42 year old student was a social liability, but lately I&#x27;ve been getting the sense that isn&#x27;t the case.

While we agreed that &quot;intuition based on experience&quot; is part of the answer; we also settled on a few rules - I hope y&#x27;all can add a few more or poke holes in these.<p>1) How long since the problem has been seriously revisited? If your queries about new ways are dismissed with facile contempt, but no details and no examples and no specific journal references then maybe nobody alive or active in the field was around when the issue or technology became &quot;settled.&quot; When Elon entered the rocket business, it had been an Oligopoly for a long time; many problems, such as how to form aluminum into a fuel tank other than by milling a huge chunk, hadn&#x27;t been revisited in a couple of decades and more.<p>2) You hear &quot;If it were possible somebody would have done it already&quot; repeatedly from the &quot;experts.&quot; This means &quot;Even though this is my field and it would be an obvious advance I&#x27;ve never spent a second thinking about this.&quot; Which is odd, and suggests 1) is true, at a minimum, or perhaps that prevalent unconscious assumptions that have never been explicitly stated or tested, have decided the issue, at a maximum.<p>3) The question is just outside the understood boundaries of any current common field of expertise. Experts, we know from research, wildly overestimate their competence when considering questions bordering on their genuine area of expertise or outside it.<p>4) The topic has become disreputable, for reasons that are more coincidental than evidential.

Store in the data from all the .txt files in different tables. Then write different queries to get data from all the related tables by joining them.<p>2. Write a python script and use different tools like grep, cut etc within the script to get the data slice. For example, first I can run grep on person.txt file to get all the records in person.txt file. Then run grep on other files(using person_id if that is the foreign key in the other file or some other field from the result I got from previous grep).<p>Approach 1 will give the advantage of indexing in database which will make reading from tables faster.<p>On the other hand writing a python script will avoid the overhead of creating a database, storing all the data in the database and joining.<p>I&#x27;m not sure which his the best way to get better execution time for my requirement.

Would you support a total ban?<p>If you know anywhere in the world implementing such a ban, feel free to post links.","time":1519162803,"title":"Ask HN: Would you support a total ban on students bringing devices to school?","type":"story"},{"by":"dfabulich","descendants":117,"id":16424445,"kids":[16424797,16428706,16424636,16427983,16426421,16425718,16426120,16424724,16426063,16424710,16425517,16427917,16428852,16425128],"score":159,"time":1519162654,"title":"How to Replace Google's AMP Without Slowing It Down","type":"story","url":"https://redfin.engineering/how-to-fix-googles-amp-without-slowing-it-down-522bc5e1e11d"},{"by":"derekjobst","descendants":9,"id":16424432,"kids":[16441611,16424447,16434590],"score":11,"time":1519162554,"title":"Show HN: Diversity ranking of 100 top tech companies","type":"story","url":"http://www.deartechpeople.com/"},{"by":"ahawkins","descendants":10,"id":16424299,"kids":[16424313,16426071,16493479,16428704,16475174],"score":5,"time":1519161646,"title":"Show HN: Who's Hiring RSS Feed","type":"story","url":"http://whoshiring.news"},{"by":"fmihaila","descendants":290,"id":16424362,"kids":[16425296,16424757,16424572,16425662,16428405,16424962,16426127,16424740,16428303,16424617,16425032,16424498,16425903,16425349,16425031,16424586,16428330,16425525,16429386,16424650,16425314,16427843,16425034,16425297,16429106,16426046,16426262,16425625,16426437,16429128,16426698,16425542,16426448,16425747,16428160,16425422,16424691,16425853,16425142,16427649,16425110,16425344,16425895,16424951,16428205,16425283,16425308,16428615,16429435,16427780,16424854,16425626,16424646,16424557,16425911,16425256,16427948,16424893,16424866,16424944,16424719,16431078,16424566,16424900,16424930],"score":332,"time":1519162114,"title":"There's a Persistent Hum in Windsor, Ontario, and No One Knows Why","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/world/canada/windsor-hum.html"},{"by":"whalesalad","descendants":2,"id":16424255,"kids":[16424668,16426847],"score":8,"time":1519161192,"title":"Rails Callbacks: 5 Best Practices Used at Gusto","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/gusto-engineering/rails-callbacks-5-best-practices-used-at-gusto-7df1094f19fd"},{"by":"erispoe","descendants":1,"id":16423968,"kids":[16449789,16424060],"score":7,"time":1519159135,"title":"Stop saying that diversity means lowering the bar","type":"story","url":"https://work.qz.com/1175679/software-engineer-tracy-chous-mission-to-diversify-silicon-valley"},{"by":"extrafoo","descendants":2,"id":16423913,"kids":[16430385,16428588,16424009,16424043],"score":8,"time":1519158814,"title":"Show HN: RedditDaily – Top posts from your favorite subreddits emailed to you","type":"story","url":"https://redditdaily.co"},{"by":"rahulshiv","descendants":21,"id":16423843,"kids":[16424565,16424395,16424502,16425159,16424409,16424834,16424842],"score":39,"time":1519158221,"title":"China spends $300M to buy lab produced meats from Israel","type":"story","url":"https://www.fanaticalfuturist.com/2018/02/china-spends-300million-to-buy-lab-produced-meats-from-israel/"},{"by":"okfine","descendants":5,"id":16423790,"kids":[16424530,16427087],"score":30,"time":1519157879,"title":"Instead of tracking page loads, track how many times it was viewed (2017)","type":"story","url":"https://philipwalton.com/articles/how-we-track-pageviews-is-all-wrong/"},{"by":"mr_golyadkin","descendants":30,"id":16423763,"kids":[16424939,16424578,16424499,16426674,16427897,16428475,16424319],"score":57,"time":1519157673,"title":"Buy Now, Pay Later Helps JAB Billionaires Build Beverage Empire","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-30/buy-now-pay-later-helps-jab-billionaires-build-beverage-empire"},{"by":"dimpu","descendants":2,"id":16423714,"kids":[16423927,16424267,16423855],"score":2,"text":"I&#x27;m frustrated with the process of applying for jobs on job boards and other sites answering same questions again.

We&#x27;re the founders of Nutrigene (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mynutrigene.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mynutrigene.com</a>). We ship tailor-made liquid supplements based on your body composition and scientific research.<p>I&#x27;m a biophysicist and epigeneticist who spent more than 10 years studying how environmental factors influence the expression of our genes, focusing on the mechanism of metabolites (including vitamins) in both plants and humans. Min has spent more than 10 years as a personal trainer, health coach and behavioral scientist working in the food and consumer product goods space.<p>This all started because I wanted to be healthier and was frustrated with a lack of answers from our healthcare system, which only sees our data through a “survival” lens (oh you don’t need to be in urgent care or surgery now). I wanted to live beyond just surviving to truly thrive, by reducing chronic pain and fatigue and feeling more energetic. As a PhD in Biophysic and Epigenetics, my natural state to a frustrating, unsolved problem is to start conducting experiments and collecting data on myself. So I started getting involved in tracking and monitoring (using many Google sheets), through collecting blood panels, heart monitor data, and wearables for my activity and sleep. I’ve experimented with different remedies and diets to recover my health after a relatively difficult pregnancy. Eventually this led to the idea for a startup that would make it easy for people to take action based on their health data, by coming up with tailor-made products for the individual. We&#x27;re beginning with high-quality liquid vitamins.<p>Why vitamins? Despite trying to eat as well as possible every day, I found it tough to do as a startup founder and new mom. And the data showed it’s not just me. Almost 90% of Americans are deficient in something or another, because we can’t eat perfectly every day, and recent research shows from NHANES and CDC shows that more Americans are not reaching their recommended daily allowances.<p>Why liquid supplements? The supplements industry is broken - there’s lack of quality, transparency and attention to purity. The majority of the vitamins and supplements you buy through Amazon, or Walgreens degrade, 50% after 6 months on shelves. Our goal is to send you the freshest, ready-made liquid supplements in our lab that are 1) unadulterated (no fillers such as starch or sugar), 2) pure liquid to maximize absorption (not breaking down any sort of tablet or softgel coating e.g. gelatin), and 3) an easier form factor to swallow than a pill. Plus, it’s easier to measure the purity of the supplements on mass spectrophotometry and HPLC in liquid form.<p>Why tailor-made? One of our advisors, Professor Bruce Hollis, has spent more than four decades studying Vitamin D deficiencies that show how we should be taking more Vitamin D than the RDA, in particular Vitamin D3, but off the shelf producers still use outdated information. The isoform of the vitamin matters, and we’ve incorporated hundreds of other papers across other vitamins, minerals and amino acids to provide the right unique mix to each person. We &quot;tailor-make&quot; it for you based on two factors. (1) Body composition. A 150lb man should not be getting the same dose as a 210lb man. Different fat and muscle composition determines whether fat soluble gets stored or how vitamins get metabolized. Most of this research is done in the nutritional sports space. (2) Genetics. The type of vitamin matters (isoform). Certain people who are more Vitamin D deficient should take Vitamin D3 which is one step away from metabolizing to its active form, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, in our bodies. Another common vitamin that has been an issue for many women in particular is folic acid. A set of SNP mutations prevent anyone from properly methylating folic acid and hence many practitioners recommend taking methylfolate and same goes for Vitamin B12 (cobalamin), which its methyl form is methylcobalamin.<p>Degradation&#x2F;oxidation is a big issue and we try to resolve that by making it just-in-time and capping it immediately after production. We also experiment with different formulations to prevent digestion of vitamins so they can be absorbed further down the line in your gut. No fillers, no starch, no sugar. Just vitamins.<p>High quality liquid vitamins are just the beginning. We want to see if vitamins do work using trackers, wearables, blood work, and even quantifying improvements in performances. Anecdotally, I’ve been seeing a drastic decrease in my base heart rate and more frequently see this low base heart rate during the day. My aortic heart stiffness has become less stiff giving me an age heart of 31 (I’m 33). These data are preliminary, but even blood work says I’m all good which isn’t indicative of whether I’m performing better or feeling healthier. We continue to find other ways to biohack ourselves but most importantly create a community of people who also want to take control of their health.

So those baseball scouts actually ruined his life.<p>I think I&#x27;m a lot like him. How can I break out of this?<p>I happen to be very good at a-ha problems, which show up often in interviews. I know a lot about how to optimize algorithms. I can talk learnedly about the tradeoffs between various paradigms. Interviewers are often very impressed.<p>The problem is, the job has nothing really to do with the above skills. It&#x27;s mostly about slogging through poorly documented Java framework code, and getting some masochistic buzz from it. The desire to craft perfect code is an <i>obstacle</i>. Know how to do it better? Congratulations, you will be permanently dissatisfied.<p>And let&#x27;s be clear, most of the job, even under the best of circumstances, isn&#x27;t about coding. At best it&#x27;s about communication and careful risk management. At worst it&#x27;s cutthroat office politics in an industry that has too much money to ever treat people in a sane or humane manner.<p>I get depressed about this, and then those same people who judged me a potential superstar start collecting evidence to fire me.<p>So I&#x27;m in a job search right now. I just aced another interview.

HN,<p>In short: Is there any way to become a part-time PM (or similar)?<p>You helped me tremendously getting my first properly paid and interesting full-time PM job at a bigger company (and luckily with little overtime, but part-time is probably no option).¹ I plan to do this job for at least a year (for vita, experience and money), but ultimately I want to work part-time.<p>I could easily live on my current salary (just with less savings) and want to have more free time for side-projects and a generally better work&#x2F;life balance.<p>All I have right now is vague plans on how to find something part-time: I will stay on the lookout on job-offers, hoping for startups that can&#x27;t afford full-time positions. Alternatively I thought of freelancing, but here the generalist qualities of a PM (project or product) might make it a bit harder to sell myself and I&#x27;m not the very best at networking either. And freelancing is never part-time, right? Should I apply for full-time positions and try to convince them of doing part-time?<p>With product management, or more precisely writing concepts and non-technical requirements I could imagine contract work. But I don&#x27;t really know if this is a thing.<p>About me: 30yo; in Germany; OK with leaving the country for a while; with a slightly off masters degree;<p>If you got any ideas or took a similar path in the past, let me know!

I am a junior developer and I start working for around 6 month ago. Here at my workplace they are using Angular and Node stack along with Mysql.\nAs I have told that I am working here for 6 month I have been exposed to all of these three technologies and I am learning all three at once. I worked on backend for 3 months then I switched to front end. Also a little bit of mysql for defining views to fetch different type of data that consists of joins and aggregate.<p>I am being careful to learn about all important stuff as in authentication and authorization, defining caching layer at backend side.<p>To learn good practices for good performance UI, where I have realized we have messed up our front end codebase a lot right now. Because we don&#x27;t have any senior I can ask questions too. \nAll I could have counted on was myself and all the things I can explore. \nAfter 6 months of learning and trying all these things have now started to make sense. \nWhy codebase layout is super important, why MVP, MVVM and almost anything sucks.<p>I really feel afraid of telling my manager to use any given kind of layout for our code because I can&#x27;t imagine in my head how a given methodology will help us solve make sense of our code in a good way. \nSo I think I have a lot of questions right now?<p>1 Am I going on a right path where I am giving breadth of topics more preference over depth.<p>2. How to look at your codebase both backend and front end lay it out in a way that feels natural, what I meant is MVM and MVVM is kind of messed up when you have lot of things to put around. \nMy boss is saying to turn monolith app into micro services and to use dockers and all which I still have to learn. \nSo any kind if help would be appreciated.<p>Any kind of advice that you can give a 6 month old developer on which path to follow to become a world class problem solver. \nThank you.

CoinTracker is a cryptocurrency portfolio manager that automatically pulls balances and transactions from top exchanges and wallets, and delivers tax information to users.<p>We built CoinTracker because, as cryptocurrency investors, we were let down by the existing tools for basic performance tracking of our investments. We started by simply creating a spreadsheet that enabled manual entry of transactions, and eventually hacked away with Google Apps scripts to import prices from various exchanges. This quickly got out of hand, so we built our own tool. We casually told a few friends who are into cryptocurrency about it. They found it as useful as we did, and to our surprise started telling their friends about it. We started receiving a steady stream of feature requests, and since then we have been steadily improving CoinTracker.<p>One of CoinTracker’s foundational aspects is that balances and transactions are automatically synced from exchanges and cryptocurrency wallets. Before CoinTracker, we hated the idea of manually entering every transaction into a tool. This approach also enables us to calculate cost basis, ROI, capital gains, and other tax-related information for you. There are technical challenges of ensuring that we correctly handle transfers between your wallets and transitively handle cost basis — something that a lot of other tools struggle to do correctly. We think this direction is enabling us to build the best cryptocurrency portfolio tracker with important services like taxes built on top.<p>We&#x27;d love to get feedback from the HN community on CoinTracker and how we can improve.

My problem might seem silly, or it might seem like a rich person problem, I apologize in advance for that.<p>I&#x27;ve been working in the financial industry for about 15 years, doing quantitative trading (writing algorithms to trade). I feel at the top of my profession (I am paid very well, 1 MM+ and recognized in the field). However, a couple of years ago, I started to completely disengage. I felt I stopped learning anything. I think the field is very hard, and now I feel completely incompetent.<p>I feel like I have the following options:<p>1) Stay in my current job, but I can sense the pressure mounting due to my lack of results. My compensation has gone down a lot recently, and will probably go down much more. I have been trying to reengage, but have been even unable to do the bare minimum.<p>2) Go to another company, in a similar role. I feel I will be paid only the first year, probably 1 MM (they guarantee the first year payment), and then be fired as I undoubtedly fail (I am now unable to perform)<p>3) Try to change industries. Go to Google for example.<p>When I think about options 1 and 2, it makes me very unhappy. I feel like a fraud, and I feel very incompetent. Part of me feels that I should do 2, as I have a responsability to my family to make money. I certainly do not feel rich, as I think I might be unable to work soon, and the money I have saved will not last forever.<p>Option 3 makes me feel the best, I feel like I could learn something new and have a new challenge. However, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s even remotely doable to earn say 500k+, and if Google would be even interested at all by hiring someone like me.<p>So anyway, that&#x27;s my situation.

I have decided to quit my job, and hopefully discover some new passions over the next few years<p>- Want to learn more life skills, and challenge different parts of my brain, and have different experiences to stay stimulated\n- The lifestyle is not healthy, sitting all day, staring at screens, you don&#x27;t fully undo the damage even by breaking up the day with frequent exercise. All of my close colleagues have poor posture\n- It&#x27;s easy to become isolated, I work in an open plan office surrounded by smart people with headphones on\n- I don&#x27;t see myself growing older to continue working on a computer when I&#x27;m 60. My body is giving me signs that I won&#x27;t be able to. My father is over 60 and does pottery full time and loves it.<p>The goal here is to find a lifestyle where I can stay active throughout the day and discover new passions which I may pursue.<p>Looking for any advice on this, how do you find a new passion? How would you spend the money? I went straight from college to full time employment and haven&#x27;t stopped working until now. My passion has always been software development. I wouldn&#x27;t mind investing in courses like blacksmithing, welding, dancing, cooking! Maybe volunteering on a farm. Train to become a paramedic? Become a yoga instructor? Learn the violin.<p>Feels silly starting dance lessons at 32, ideally I would have started while younger. On the plus side, I do have a big chunk of money which can pay for specialised training, something harder to do when you&#x27;re younger (you have the time but not the money).<p>My yearly costs are around £20k, supportive partner, no kids, live near London. Mentally prepared that after a few years I can struggle to get a job in software dev if I want one and prepared that I may not earn any money for the next few years. I&#x27;m taking a risk that I&#x27;ll find a passion and be able to monetize when the time comes. I do have some backup savings.","time":1518690951,"title":"Ask HN: I have £100k to spend.

Katherine Homuth and I founded Sheerly Genius - indestructible sheer tights made from bulletproof fibers. We just launched our product on Kickstarter (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.2e.go2.fund&#x2F;tights\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.2e.go2.fund&#x2F;tights</a>).<p>Every year $8 billion dollars worth of sheer tights&#x2F;pantyhose end up in the landfill after only one or two wears. Ripping sheers is as easy as accidentally catching them on a fingernail, or simply pulling too hard while putting them on. Our goal is to replace these disposable products with Sheerly Genius, which has been tested to last up to 50 wears.<p>We have been working on this for about 12 months so far and it has been quite an adventure. When I started out I didn’t think we’d be developing our own fiber and machines, but that’s what it ultimately took.<p>The first fibers I looked at were aramids, like kevlar, which of course were attractive for their strength. To be considered sheer (as opposed to opaque), a pair of tights needs fibers that are 30 denier or less. Denier measures the thickness or fineness of a fiber. I quickly learned that the lowest denier kevlar came in was 1000 denier! So it was a non-starter.<p>It turned out that none of the fibers on the market today were both fine and strong enough to make an indestructible sheer product. Ultimately we had to develop our own fiber: a finer, colored version of the non-dyeable polyethylene fibers used in higher end bulletproof vests and climbing equipment. To use these fibers we had to retrofit circular knitting machines with new feeding systems and blades, because the fibers are so strong they break typical knitting machines!<p>My background is in software and manufacturing - building and selling two companies prior to Sheerly Genius. But this is my first journey into textiles. In my last startup I worked directly with many hardware companies, but became increasingly skeptical of the trend in IoT towards “connected” anything. One thing I love about this project is that we’ve been able to innovate in wearables without being connected.<p>Fun Fact: Half of our backers on Kickstarter so far have been men!<p>I’m looking forward to talking manufacturing, textiles, and crowdfunding. Can’t wait to hear your ideas and experiences in these areas.

Hours and hours of work that could be replaced with a simple database query if they had structured data.

I even became super good at finding the apartments on Google Earth so I can look at them from the outside. Insane.<p>To add insult to injury, neither of the two sites offer to tag apartments as &quot;I don&#x27;t like it&quot;.

But this year, we decided to level up and add alerts from Twitter to our service, making it the only one of its kind to deliver the most important conversations from twitter to your inbox for free.<p>As a marketer, often the most tedious task we have to undertake is monitoring our brand and presence online. Scrolling through a bajillion social networks and pages on the internet is not just time-consuming, it’s also a full-time job.<p>Meaning, you often have to work late just because you didn’t know what someone on Twitter said about you in time.<p>But how cool would it be if you didn’t have to spend any time combing the Twitter (or the internet) for brand mentions but had them delivered to your inbox every day - as they happened? That would free up way more time for brainstorming and solving any potential problems that arise as a direct effect of all the brand mentions that are delivered to your inbox.<p>Well, now you can. All you have to do is set up an alert using Talkwalker Alerts. It takes just 10 seconds (or less) and all you have to do after that is sit back, relax and watch out for emails from Talkwalker Alerts and have way more fun brainstorming sessions with the time you save! We’re already delivering over 700k alerts to 450,000 inboxes ;)<p>Once again, that’s just 10 seconds to set up and it’s completely free! In return you’ll get alerts from social media and discussion forums straight to your inbox, making the entire process of keeping track of your brand a whole lot easier.<p>I’m around all day to answer any questions you have about the product and would welcome any feedback from you on it.<p>Go on, try it out, set up an alert for your brand and send out a Tweet to test it out

However, there’s a much larger attack surface upstream of HTTPS protections, Load Balancers, upstream enterprise components (an explosion with microservices trends), and the application servers themselves.

Haiku is a UI-building tool for both designers and developers. You can import vector and bitmap assets, animate them with a visual timeline, make elements respond to events, script behavior (if you like to code), then publish as production-ready UI components. Haiku components are versioned and can be pulled into codebases via Git or npm.<p>We are a remote, international team of six. We&#x27;ve all spent years in various design&#x2F;development roles, and we&#x27;ve all run into the same problem: When building software, teams waste too much effort creating designs in design tools, then reimplementing those designs in code.<p>Here&#x27;s how we&#x27;re working to solve that:<p>1. Create a common tongue for design tools and codebases to communicate. We&#x27;re starting with a simple JavaScript file format that can capture both how designs look and how components behave, where animation is a first-class citizen. We call this format Haiku Core and we&#x27;ve open sourced it under the MIT license, along with a standards-driven interpreter&#x2F;renderer for that format on the Web. We&#x27;d love to hear from the community about how to improve our format or Web renderer.<p>2. Create a design tool that speaks that language. Our desktop app, Haiku for Mac [2], brings a familiar visual design&#x2F;animation experience to designers, while remaining connected to the world of code. Haiku tracks designs with Git and delivers versioned components to developers. Haiku automatically sets up and hosts Git infrastructure and npm registration for your components. (This infrastructure is optional. Your files always sit on your computer, and you own them.)<p>3. Integrate with the tools that design&#x2F;development teams already use. If you like to draw, you can keep designing in Sketch and see changes sync on stage. If you like to code, you can edit Haiku source files directly in your favorite text editor. Out of the box, Haiku components are compatible with vanilla web codebases, React, and Vue. Haiku also supports exporting to Airbnb&#x27;s Lottie format, allowing native animation authoring for iOS, Android, or React Native.<p>Thanks for reading, HN.  We know this subject is close to many people&#x27;s hearts here — we&#x27;d love to hear what you&#x27;d like to see in a UI-building &amp; collaboration tool like Haiku.<p>[1]: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;HaikuTeam&#x2F;core\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;HaikuTeam&#x2F;core</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.haiku.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.haiku.ai</a>","time":1518462023,"title":"Launch HN: Haiku (YC W18) – Build and Design Cross-Platform UIs and Animations","type":"story"},{"by":"devy","descendants":13,"id":16360938,"kids":[16365157,16364841,16365197,16364436],"score":32,"time":1518461736,"title":"I’m no longer advocating for clean energy; here’s why (2017)","type":"story","url":"https://jmkorhonen.net/2017/07/26/im-no-longer-advocating-for-clean-energy-heres-why/"},{"by":"mijustin","descendants":118,"id":16360890,"kids":[16364177,16361604,16362756,16360903,16361190,16362911,16361746,16362185,16361293,16362339,16361212,16366059,16363781,16363335,16364241,16362076,16363332,16365202,16365193,16361422,16363483,16363461,16363549],"score":260,"time":1518461453,"title":"Hidden work when launching a SaaS","type":"story","url":"https://workshop.kwoosh.com/post/the-hidden-work-when-launching-a-saas.html"},{"by":"dnetesn","descendants":10,"id":16360848,"kids":[16373618,16375926,16377352,16377365],"score":101,"time":1518461123,"title":"Fish that walk on seafloor use same neurons and genes as land vertebrates","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/science/skate-walking-fish-evolution.html"},{"by":"tenderlove","descendants":37,"id":16360810,"kids":[16362745,16364222,16361419,16361401,16363209,16361982,16361344,16361971],"score":194,"time":1518460878,"title":"Speeding Up Ruby with Shared Strings","type":"story","url":"https://tenderlovemaking.com/2018/02/12/speeding-up-ruby-with-shared-strings.html"},{"by":"Mic92","descendants":37,"id":16360738,"kids":[16361233,16361516,16364827,16360887,16361884,16365814],"score":194,"time":1518460416,"title":"Inspector – A drop-anywhere C++ REPL","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/inspector-repl/inspector"},{"by":"Osiris30","descendants":2,"id":16360671,"kids":[16360870,16361101],"score":11,"time":1518459994,"title":"Google Makes Its Special A.I.

They tended to be stuff like &quot;how would you find all the phone numbers in this file?&quot; or &quot;how many manhole covers do you think are in New York City?&quot; I don&#x27;t want to miss any bright candidates who just aren&#x27;t used to technical interviewing, but I also don&#x27;t want to sign off on someone who can&#x27;t write a for loop.

We are building enterprise software that prepares patients for surgeries (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medumo.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medumo.com</a>). Millions of patients go through these things every year. The problem is that patient instructions are provided months in advance, in the form of paper handouts or verbal instructions that are easily forgotten. As physicians, we saw firsthand how poor patient experience can impact hospital operations and surgical outcome. For example, when patients forget to stop medications that can cause bleeding, the surgeries have to be cancelled last minute which is costly. Or worse, poorly prepared patients get the surgery and have avoidable complications.<p>Our team came together to solve this problem with patient navigation software that gives turn-by-turn instructions, reminders, and educational material through friendly, accessible medium (SMS&#x2F;email) to deliver the best experience and surgical outcome.<p>Unfortunately, health systems are notorious for moving slowly, so introducing a new digital platform can be challenging and slow. We are overcoming this by starting with simple use cases like colonoscopy, proving our value quickly and expanding to other areas. Another challenge is that patients respond differently to instructions; so instead of taking a one-size-fits-all approach, we are constantly varying instructions and A&#x2F;B testing patient behavior to improve outcomes.<p>12 hospitals use our software to date. We have demonstrated improvement in show rate and procedure preparation quality.

The Company has started to use, invent, and work on technology that I care about outside of work. I am worried that my existing and new projects, open or closed, could be threatened if I don&#x27;t protect myself.  I have engaged our Company counsel to begin the process of amending my employment agreement to address this. However, I&#x27;m unsure what to explicitly call out to protect past projects as well as potential new ones.<p>How does one effectively and intelligently detail previous projects while specifying potential new ones as it relates to certain technologies in an employment agreement? For instance, if I were working on a database system off hours, research or applied, how do I protect myself if the Company decides to build database systems? In theory, my employment agreement with the Company says that work is now owned by the Company.<p>Basically, I am probing for advisement on how to proceed without wasting any individuals time involved in this process. I am looking for other technology professionals to give me guidance navigating this messy and sensitive situation.<p>Thank you very much for your help.","time":1518109150,"title":"Ask HN: How to protect IP on side projects which interest my employer?","type":"story"},{"by":"tigitz","descendants":6,"id":16333537,"kids":[16340451,16333580,16333727],"score":5,"text":"As a practice exercise for every language, porting a library is a great way to have a better grasp of a language while filling a gap for its developers needs<p>It gives your learning project a real meaning and therefore helps with your motivation to learn.<p>I&#x27;m trying to build a list of libraries having this potential.<p>Which library made you think &quot;I wish it was ported on language X&quot; ?","time":1518108982,"title":"Ask HN: Which library would you like to see ported on language X?","type":"story"},{"by":"marcionitao","descendants":6,"id":16333868,"kids":[16334470,16334143,16334488,16334196,16334482],"score":9,"time":1518111251,"title":"Show HN: SucheBilder – Find a perfect photo for your work","type":"story","url":"https://marcionitao.github.io/SucheBilder/"},{"by":"smacktoward","descendants":54,"id":16333399,"kids":[16333776,16333644,16333802,16333662,16333740,16335751,16333664],"score":38,"time":1518108055,"title":"The Navy’s Second Stealth Zumwalt-Class Destroyer Is Almost Ready for Action","type":"story","url":"http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/the-navys-second-stealth-zumwalt-class-destroyer-almost-24383"},{"by":"jellyapple","descendants":8,"id":16333477,"kids":[16334106,16333579,16336249,16333975,16335518,16333747],"score":142,"time":1518108656,"title":"Interactive GPU Programming, Part 2: Hello OpenCL","type":"story","url":"http://dragan.rocks/articles/18/Interactive-GPU-Programming-2-Hello-OpenCL"},{"by":"katm","descendants":7,"id":16333445,"kids":[16337414,16334009,16335616,16336457,16337632],"score":119,"time":1518108415,"title":"Y Combinator Is Launching a “Grad School” for Booming Startups","type":"story","url":"http://www.fastcompany.com/40524163/y-combinator-is-launching-a-grad-school-for-booming-startups"},{"by":"rich_harris","descendants":10,"id":16333273,"kids":[16333461,16334812,16335970,16333865,16334225,16335219],"score":75,"time":1518107172,"title":"Rollup now has code-splitting and we need your help","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/rollup/rollup-now-has-code-splitting-and-we-need-your-help-46defd901c82"},{"by":"2paisay","dead":true,"id":16333259,"kids":[16333859,16334771,16333613,16334296],"score":15,"time":1518107088,"title":"Jeff Bezos’ Quest to Find America’s Stupidest Mayor","type":"story","url":"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-baker-amazon-hq2_us_5a7b28aee4b08dfc92ff0128"},{"by":"known","descendants":112,"id":16333219,"kids":[16333808,16333908,16334161,16333783,16333876,16333819,16333789,16333743,16333927,16336818,16333721,16334294,16336190,16333787,16333792,16333821,16334091],"score":138,"time":1518106832,"title":"Practical, unsexy steps to become a millionaire","type":"story","url":"https://qz.com/913249/the-practical-steps-it-takes-to-actually-become-a-millionaire/"},{"by":"tsucres","descendants":67,"id":16333114,"kids":[16333851,16333608,16333870,16333596,16334555,16333734,16333760,16333791,16334490,16334519,16333726,16337546,16336601,16333400,16333590,16333592,16333415,16333714,16335151,16333700,16335290,16339274,16333424,16334504,16333478,16333691,16333680,16333561,16335921],"score":127,"time":1518106395,"title":"Show HN: HNBuddy – A fast and elegant HN client for iOS","type":"story","url":"http://www.hnbuddy.io"},{"by":"revalo","descendants":53,"id":16333001,"kids":[16334174,16333335,16333553,16333274,16333900,16333287,16334319,16333212,16333356,16333239,16334377,16333624,16335887,16336583,16334191,16334177,16333589,16333701,16333237,16333338],"score":75,"time":1518105694,"title":"Show HN: RoastMe.io – A neural network that has learned to insult","type":"story","url":"http://roastme.io"},{"by":"joshrotenberg","descendants":59,"id":16332925,"kids":[16333327,16334523,16335462,16335487,16335384,16334432,16335123,16336571,16336870,16335397,16334122,16335433,16334386,16334240,16335922,16335631],"score":40,"time":1518105220,"title":"Merrell Trail Glove Failures and Minimal Running in a Communist Shoe","type":"story","url":"https://blatanterror.com/2018/02/08/merrell-trail-glove-failures-and-a-minimal-running-in-a-communist-shoe/"},{"by":"godelmachine","dead":true,"id":16332824,"kids":[16332923,16332860],"score":1,"text":"Nicholas Cage&#x27;s famous movie - National Treasure was named &quot;Book of Secrets&quot; for its sequel.

We’ve built a tool that makes it simple for a writer to start a paid email newsletter. Sign up, connect to Stripe, and go. Our first publisher, Bill Bishop, writes a newsletter about China (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nb.sinocism.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nb.sinocism.com</a>) and got to six figures of annual revenue on his first day on Substack. Bill had been publishing Sinocism as a free newsletter for five years and had 30k subscribers. Now he can make a living from it.<p>Hamish is a journalist who has done everything from writing about indie music in Hong Kong to being lead writer for Tesla. We bonded over our shared love of reading when he worked at Kik, where Chris was the technical co-founder. Last summer, Chris was taking time off and asked Hamish to read an essay he was trying to write about the incentive structures of social media for writers, and how growing outrage and polarization was making it hard to have reasonable conversations. At the same time, we both loved Ben Thompson’s newsletter, Stratechery, which was doing really well off paid subscriptions. We wondered: what if it were easier for writers to start something like that? That felt more like a company than an essay, and so one thing led to another...<p>An example of a Substack newsletter you might enjoy is Versioning (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;versioning.substack.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;versioning.substack.com</a>), a daily reading list for web developers and designers. We also recommend Mallory Ortberg’s The Shatner Chatner (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.shatnerchatner.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.shatnerchatner.com</a>) and Helena Fitzgerald’s Griefbacon (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;griefbacon.substack.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;griefbacon.substack.com</a>).<p>The product is still in a pretty early phase but we’ve just launched our self-serve beta, where anyone can create a newsletter, free or paid: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.substack.com&#x2F;beta-signup\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.substack.com&#x2F;beta-signup</a>. At this stage, it’s completely free until you start charging, in which case we take a fee: 10% for people who start during the beta.<p>We know a lot of folks on HN care about this stuff too, so we’re keen to hear your feedback. Also: if you know any writers you’d be happy to pay to read (or if that’s you), we’d love to hear about that too.","time":1518025700,"title":"Launch HN: Substack (YC W18): Paid email newsletters made

Download the browser at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supermedium.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supermedium.com</a>, put on a headset, and navigate dozens of full VR sites. Pages load quickly and are built with Web standards (WebGL, WebVR, JS). Anyone can publish and share VR content, regardless of whether that content is bite-sized, wacky, lower fidelity, a store’s homepage, an educational outing for a few students, a meme, or something taboo. Anything goes.<p>Back in 2012, I was researching for headsets that I could watch movies on. I thought it would be cool to have a giant TV anywhere at home or on the go. Soon I became a lurker in the MTBS3D.com forums. I followed the first conversations between Palmer Luckey and John Carmack experimenting with VR hardware [1]. I was one of the 50 members that sent money to Palmer Luckey’s personal PayPal account to get a DIY prototype kit of the early Oculus Rift [2]. I got to try an early version of the Rift and an early 3D-printed prototype of what would become the HTC Vive. It felt the future was approaching quickly and I did not want miss out on the next technological revolution. I was on a quest to find a way to combine my knowledge of the Web with my newly discovered passion in VR.<p>Kevin and I were teammates on the original Mozilla VR team that kicked off the WebVR initiative. Together we created and grew A-Frame, an open source framework to help Web developers build VR content in the browser. Two years later, we continue to volunteer our time to maintain A-Frame alongside its community.<p>We are kids from the Web; we formed as programmers using browsers as our playground. We loved learning from others using the built-in developer tools and sharing our experiments with just a link. But we witnessed first-hand how slowly the Web reacted to the rise of smartphones and app store ecosystems. The Web became an afterthought.<p>We know it is still the early days for VR. VR hardware is expensive, clunky, and software feels undercooked. But we believe that in the future, headsets (whether VR or AR) will replace traditional displays, transforming the way we interact with computers. We want the Web to be a first-class citizen on VR and on immersive platforms going forward. We founded Supermedium to try to help establish the Web as a valuable foundation for the next big shifts in personal computing. We want to bring the best ingredients of the Web to VR. And it starts with a browser.<p>Looking forward to hearing feedback!<p>Diego and Kevin<p>---<p>[1] <a

Infra either doesn&#x27;t scale, or it&#x27;s too time consuming &#x2F; painful to maintain and sometimes lacks redundancy, monitoring, and so forth.  Next, companies seek to hire more devs, except devs that have significant systems experience:  AWS, load balancing, configuration management, etc.  They have trouble finding these so salaries for what has become &quot;DevOps&quot; have ballooned.

If the field really is overcrowded, then what difference am I really making by just joining in? Looking at the future and trying to predict anything with great success is incredibly hard, but it seems like the most important things for this century are AI, aging&#x2F;bio&#x2F;health, energy and development of space.<p>Now I could be completely wrong on this, but it seems like energy is being taken care of. Simple economics will create a demand for renewables and there does&#x27;t seem to be a shortage of people working on solar, wind, water, storage, fission. Maybe fusion is worth looking at but I feel like the energy crisis will be solved by the others and fusion would be an added benefit. Biotech is an interesting area which I haven&#x27;t considered, but it seems like computers &#x2F; AI will be the major useful tool in this area also (this could be wrong, I&#x27;ve just read that biology is really data heavy). Space development is pretty broad, chemical rockets have been maxed out and the main differentiating factor between companies now is software (raptor engines pretty much hit the limit for chemical engines). And really any of the other fields mentioned (AI, biotech, energy) would be useful to work on if one was interested in space development.<p>Basically, I&#x27;m at a crossroads and really just want to be useful.

I’m Bilal, cofounder of ClearBrain (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clearbrain.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clearbrain.com</a>). ClearBrain helps you automatically build predictive models for which of your users are most likely to convert or churn in your app. Think AmazonML for marketing analysts.<p>Our founding team comes from Optimizely &amp; Google where we built similar predictive tools for our marketing teams. At each company, we kept building the same components of a predictive pipeline - javascript snippets to collect data, ETL jobs to transform that data, and cron jobs to run a regression. We were spending hours a week maintaining these pipelines, but the time-consuming part wasn’t the algorithms (as they’re open sourced) it was the transformations.<p>So with ClearBrain we decided to automate the data transformation steps. We built our system in Spark ML (scala), Data Pipeline, and Go. Instead of instrumenting yet another Javascript snippet, we use existing data in Segment (YC S11) and Heap (YC W13) through standard integrations. And because every Segment&#x2F;Heap dataset has the same schema, our system can process it with the same transformations into a machine-readable feature matrix. When a customer selects a user action tracked in Segment&#x2F;Heap to predict, our transformed matrix is run through a logistic regression via Spark ML, and outputs a probabilistic score for each user to perform that action based on users who performed it in the past.<p>This distills the predictive modeling process to a simple UI to identify high-probability users in minutes. We’ve built the tool with marketers in mind, to help them identify which users may convert or churn, and export those users to marketing tools like Facebook Ads, Hubspot, etc. We’ve also found good reception from startups that have marketing objectives but lack the resources to deploy ML-driven campaigns themselves.<p>We look forward to feedback from the HN community! :)<p>Bilal","time":1517422484,"title":"Launch HN: ClearBrain (YC W18) – predictive models for app conversions and churn","type":"story"},{"by":"throwaway0071","dead":true,"id":16275983,"kids":[16276252,16276006,16275994],"score":4,"text":"Toptal, CodementorX, Upwork, etc... any preference?

We believe a well-designed base map is all you need to allow you data to shine. As we expand, we will continue to focus on putting your company and data first.<p>That&#x27;s just the beginning; we are working on several simple tools to help business owners and developers utilize maps in their web and mobile applications.

I can&#x27;t say that I understand all the technical details of blockchain (why POW, how&#x2F;why miners, how a 51% attack works, etc).  But I think I&#x27;m a reasonably intelligent person and I have been reading about the merits and use cases.<p>The problem I have is that after reading and thinking about it, I&#x27;m mostly in agreement with this article: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackernoon.com&#x2F;ten-years-in-nobody-has-come-up-with-a-use-case-for-blockchain-ee98c180100.  I think it&#x27;s a neat idea and does have some use cases (especially for illicit transactions), but nothing like the hype that is surrounding it.<p>It seems that everywhere I&#x27;m looking, people are talking about how blockchain is going to change the world and people are starting ICO&#x27;s left and right.  The problem is that most of the applications I see don&#x27;t really seem like they need blockchain and have some built-in speculation component.  I feel like it&#x27;s the current solution to a lack of effective business model.<p>I also have technical doubts.  Example a 51% attack - While this maybe hard with Bitcoin because of the network size and age, I don&#x27;t know about the other currencies&#x2F;tokens.  I&#x27;m also not clear how the coming wave of quantum computers will affect this technology.<p>But I keep seeing the articles coming - how blockchain is going to change everything - and my doubts are eating at me.

introduction to programming was through a computer science course I took during sophomore year at my high school. Soon enough I was spending all my time, both in and out of school, programming. I’m sure some people here can relate.<p>Perhaps I liked it a little too much, or maybe high school just wasn’t right for me - probably both. I imprudently worked on anything that interested me. I learned about cellular automata and wrote a simulator to create and explore these things. I made a 2D game to play with friends over the school’s network. I became interested in genetic algorithms and started messing around with them (making brainfuck to do stupid things, evolving my own programming languages, even incorporating my knowledge of CA’s to produce some neat simulations). I wrote a barebones HTTP server. I spent a week making a working 8-bit computer in minecraft. Common lisp, why not? It’s fun. ASM, bash, whatever. I’ll learn a bit of everything. I eventually ended up as an unpaid intern at a local uni’s lab (thanks to my CS teacher).<p>I like to think that I’ve done some interesting things. I like to think that these two and a half years weren’t wasted, but I’m extremely troubled right now. I’ve been told that what I’ve done is mostly academically oriented, which is quite ironic considering I’ve ruined most of my chances of studying computer science at college any time soon. Perhaps I could get a job as I’ve gained a fair level of competency Java, but I would have been much better off with this as a goal from the start rather than stuffing my brain with a bunch of niche knowledge.<p>I&#x27;ve lurked this site for awhile, this is my first post.

I am simply looking for opinions about the ideas that I have come up with after thinking critically about taxation and about the stakes held by the various players of our economic system.<p>We are taxed to fund the activity of our governments (local, state and federal). Taxation is both necessary and helpful, but how can we handle this in a way that is fair and respectful?<p>From my perspective, we should ask &quot;Who owns the US economy?&quot; The only logical answer is that it is shared among all of its participants. If the government is able to levy taxes against any participant of our economy, should a portion of said taxes not be returned to the citizens of our country.<p>I would like to propose a system of taxation founded on the idea that we should provide a fair economy to our citizens. This system comes in two parts:<p>Every transaction would be considered as having two parties, a buyer and a seller. Each would pay a tenth of the monetary value of the transaction as tax; the seller&#x27;s 10% would go to the federal government while the buyers 10% would be split evenly between the state and local governments.<p>A 10% tax would then be levied against each applicable level of government and split evenly. This would mean that 10% of the taxes collected by the local, state and federal government would be split evenly based on residency. So each year (or month, or day) everyone would receive their share of the taxes collected by their respective levels of government.<p>Thank you for taking the time to look and please comment below.","time":1516398767,"title":"Ask HN: Opinions on a novel and respectful tax system","type":"story"},{"by":"rayuela","descendants":2,"id":16190004,"kids":[16190340,16190019],"score":3,"time":1516397070,"title":"Facebook to Start Ranking News Sources Based on Trustworthiness","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-19/facebook-to-start-ranking-news-sources-based-on-trustworthiness"},{"by":"dantillberg","descendants":9,"id":16189999,"kids":[16190803,16190722,16191652,16191767,16190029,16191010],"score":16,"time":1516397034,"title":"Facebook will now ask users to rank news organizations they trust","type":"story","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/01/19/facebook-will-now-ask-its-users-to-rank-news-organizations-they-trust/"},{"by":"joering2","descendants":20,"id":16189957,"kids":[16190415,16190113,16191037,16191802,16190191,16192105],"score":18,"time":1516396726,"title":"Apple iPhone X 'End of Life' Predicted, Production Cuts Seen","type":"story","url":"https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-iphone-x-end-of-life-predicted-production-cuts-seen/?src=A00220&yptr=yahoo"},{"by":"borkt","descendants":11,"id":16189988,"kids":[16191105,16195543,16207718,16196818,16205493,16191332,16191952,16191328],"score":11,"text":"I signed up for MoviePass the day their new plan hit the news in September and was genuinely excited to try the product.

I’m Jared, the cofounder &amp; CEO of Enzyme (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enzyme.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enzyme.com</a>).<p>We’re building software that helps life science companies with FDA approval and compliance. Think of something like TurboTax but for companies that are regulated by FDA. Our product reduces both the time and cost of taking a drug or medical device to market.<p>People often talk about how software is eating the world, but that process has taken longer for heavily regulated industries in part because of their complexity. However, there are now subject matter experts who grew up using and writing software and who have also spent enough time in their industries to be able to write useful software for them. This problem is very personal for my cofounder and me. We’ve both spent 11 years in the med device&#x2F;biopharma industry and have personally felt the pain of how inefficient this is, having seen products we put our heart and soul into take months (sometimes years) longer than they should to reach patients and change lives.<p>We’re taking a labor-intensive, paper-based business process and replacing it with software that allows existing teams to perform much of the needed compliance work themselves, reducing the need to engage consultants or full-time compliance officers. Staying compliant is unfortunately very costly: small companies spend $100K+&#x2F;yr on consulting fees, while larger companies spend $100M+&#x2F;yr on FTEs and $10M+&#x2F;yr on software packages that perform only a small part of the compliance workflow!<p>We’re focused on medical device&#x2F;diagnostic&#x2F;digital health companies for now, so if you’re a founder in this space we’d love to talk.<p>We can answer questions about regulatory&#x2F;compliance strategy -- in the US, EU, and other geographies -- along with other aspects of medical product development (such as design controls, verification &amp; validation strategies, risk management, user experience, etc).<p>There&#x27;s some additional info on our TechCrunch launch announcement, here: <a

Agile is about adaptation, but it&#x27;s also about performance, delivery &amp; plan.

I&#x27;m not going to name names here but here&#x27;s what went down.<p>After a couple missed appointments from the CEO and multiple reminders from me, I finally managed to get on a call with them. I sometimes have spotty reception in my house so the call got disconnected the first time. I called back, explained the network issues, but they hung up in middle of the conversation. I called back but I wasn&#x27;t able to reach them. So, I sent a text and waited for a callback. They did call back again, hung up while I was speaking. I called back again to no avail. I felt pretty bad at this rudeness. I gave up and sent an email to say that they could email me if they wanted to continue while apologizing for spotty reception. I tweeted at their twitter account and complained about the rude interview.<p>I got an email from CTO a few days later, which resulted in a couple more rounds of seamless and painless interviewing. The CEO emails me after and let me know that they wanted to fly me into their office at very short notice(3-4 days), and booked tickets after my approval. I get a phone call the next day from their employee, who noticed the tweet I&#x27;d made earlier and asked to take it down. I took it down as requestedand asked them who I could talk to to know more about the upcoming interciew. I was asked to call the CEO, who picked up and let me know they&#x27;d call me back. I got an email a couple hours later that said:\n&quot;We had some internal discussion about you and decided you aren&#x27;t a good cultural fit, and therefore, won&#x27;t be moving forward with the process. We will be canceling the flight tickets as well.&quot;\nI posted here because I&#x27;d like to know if I was in the red here for tweeting at them about the rude interview experience.

This position is my first job out of college. I&#x27;m looking for senior SDE roles. I&#x27;m aware that I&#x27;m going to be asked for references by a number of companies. I have some questions:<p>- How important are references, typically? Are they just a sanity check after a successful round of interviews? Or are they more important?<p>I understand it&#x27;s different depending on the company. I have no insight into how tech companies use references. Historically, for internships I&#x27;ve accepted, my references have never been contacted.<p>- Is providing solely peers (including senior peers, like team leads) or direct reports (e.g. interns I&#x27;ve managed and mentored) as references okay? Is not including a manager a red flag?<p>I don&#x27;t want my manager to know I&#x27;m leaving until I&#x27;ve accepted an offer elsewhere and have given notice. On top of that, our relationship has been a bit cool as of late. I don&#x27;t think I can trust him&#x2F;her to give me a glowing reference. My relationship with my current co-workers, however, is excellent (as well as past interns I&#x27;ve mentored&#x2F;managed). I know they&#x27;ll give me some great and truthful references. In addition, I think my co-workers are better positioned to assess my skills as a software engineer; we do code reviews and design reviews and talk shop together daily, but my manager rarely participates.

been thinking about hiring processes in General and I think some of the problems that they face are a result collapsing a complex question very hastily into a binary decision.<p>Therefore I propose a &quot;multi-layered&quot; decision process, where the final step is made automatically. (This is obvious and I know it&#x27;s probably not new, if your company tried this in the past I will be happy to hear about it)<p>First essential rule: &quot;if the candidate has the highest amount of points and is willing to accept the offer, s&#x2F;he gets hired&quot;<p>Now, unlike other systems which try to prescribe, this system attempts to describe.<p>We define &quot;a reason&quot; as any true, legal (as in non-discriminatory) statement about the candidate that is precise enough.<p>Each reason can be assigned a number of points (negative or positive). The interviewer has complete freedom to assign as much points as he wants to any reason but is advised to respect previous jurisprudence and to justify himself in the cases where he goes against it.<p>Valid reasons can range (just examples) form:\n&quot;S&#x2F;he got Y GPA in University X&quot; to &quot;s&#x2F;he didn&#x27;t say hello at the start of the interview&quot;\nInvalid reasons are for example &quot;unprofessional attire&quot; this is invalid because it is vague. Reasons need be blunt and precise. &quot;S&#x2F;He wore X and Y&quot; should be valid.<p>Claim A: this makes the hiring process more traceable and open by providing a paper trail<p>Claim B: this fights part of the unconscious bias. By requiring interviewers to think and write down reasons. They can examine more critically their decisions.<p>Claim C: this helps control for overreaction. Assigning helps insure that the effect of each reason is reasonably proportional.

the greatest situation in life, and I&#x27;m looking to get some advice&#x2F;ideas from you all. Thanks.<p>Right now I&#x27;m 31. Growing up in school, I was quite intrigued by the Internet and specifically with creating websites and figuring out ways to make money. With a bit of luck, these efforts culminated in creating an e-commerce website which my business partner and I sold about 7 years ago for a healthy sum. Keep in mind I&#x27;m not a developer, we had a full-time developer. For several years after that, I tried to start a web design company with another partner, which we eventually abandoned. For the last 4 years or so, I&#x27;ve been trading short term in the financial markets. I got a little overconfident and made some riskier bets which didn&#x27;t turn out too well. I did manage to get a B.S. in Business IT from a USNews top 75 school.<p>My criminal history is probably going to be the biggest impediment here if I&#x27;m going to be looking for employment. When I was 19, I was convicted of felony eluding police. It was just a split second, bone-headed decision I made for absolutely no reason. Non-violent, no injuries, no drugs involved, and I got a jail sentence of about a week. I also have 2 DUI&#x27;s, the last one almost 5 yrs ago.<p>I was pleased to find out recently that ~10 states have adopted a law where co&#x27;s can&#x27;t go back further than 7 years on a BG check (including CA &amp; WA). My felony will be hidden but my 2 DUI&#x27;s are still barely within 7 years. I also discovered that ~10 states now have &#x27;ban the box&#x27; law prohibiting employers from asking any  criminal history Q&#x27;s until after an interview (includes CA &amp; WA).<p>I&#x27;m brainstorming now what I can do. As I said I&#x27;ve never been a developer. I remember being in middle school and buying lots of development books but never being able to plow through. My specialty back when we had our business was SEO&#x2F;online marketing, but it&#x27;s been several yrs since I&#x27;ve been involved with that.","time":1515115291,"title":"Seeking Advice for a Career Change (31 Y/o)","type":"story"},{"by":"phyller","descendants":9,"id":16075850,"kids":[16076030,16075962,16076069,16077371,16077051,16079689],"score":33,"text":"They were informed on June 1, 2017, and appear to have been selling vulnerable chips since then.

This would also significantly hamper any attempt at remote code execution in the browser.<p>Is this viable?","time":1515097981,"title":"Ask HN: Could JavaScript be moved to a higher x86 ring than userspace?","type":"story"},{"by":"ChrisRackauckas","descendants":28,"id":16073798,"kids":[16074535,16074957,16076391,16076750,16074865,16075035,16075307,16078448],"score":109,"time":1515097945,"title":"Algorithm efficiency comes from problem information","type":"story","url":"http://www.stochasticlifestyle.com/algorithm-efficiency-comes-problem-information/"},{"by":"er0l","descendants":3,"id":16073785,"kids":[16074312,16074078,16074166],"score":25,"time":1515097859,"title":"Requests to new Dynos failing","type":"story","url":"https://status.heroku.com/incidents/1367"},{"by":"jorymackay","descendants":150,"id":16073745,"kids":[16074674,16074173,16073987,16074183,16074618,16073991,16074067,16074013,16074168,16076056,16078569,16077945,16075769,16076728],"score":271,"time":1515097523,"title":"Productivity in 2017: analyzing 225 million hours of work time","type":"story","url":"http://blog.rescuetime.com/225-million-hours-productivity/"},{"by":"nickmain","descendants":125,"id":16073600,"kids":[16074998,16074696,16075146,16074869,16076201,16077756,16075118,16078003,16075161,16076869,16076633,16074736,16077230,16083505,16079136,16075934,16077666],"score":99,"time":1515096450,"title":"Wi-Fi startup Eero lays off 30 employees","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/03/wi-fi-startup-eero-lays-off-30-employees/"},{"by":"manbartlett","descendants":49,"id":16073400,"kids":[16073958,16073889,16074717,16074641,16074329,16073766],"score":39,"time":1515095115,"title":"The Expensive Art of Living Forever","type":"story","url":"https://www.topic.com/the-expensive-art-of-living-forever"},{"by":"samhp","dead":true,"id":16073378,"kids":[16073571,16073500],"score":7,"time":1515094957,"title":"How I made $1934.66 in two days of tech consulting (with no network)","type":"story","url":"http://www.samputnamconsulting.com/how-i-made-1934-in-2-days-of-technology-consulting-w-no-network"},{"by":"davidgerard","descendants":35,"id":16073298,"kids":[16074672,16078266,16074932],"score":44,"time":1515094231,"title":"Why you can’t cash out pt 3: Bitcoin is not a Ponzi!

But I would imagine there are people who would like that level of degree.<p>I also realize that a bachelors level degree has a number of requirements that aren’t purely comp sci requirements. I don’t see that as a problem. Why not have a full curriculum? I think that is possible.<p>Also, why does a comp sci degree have to cost so much? In fact, if you’re willing to put in the effort to learn and grow why can’t it be free? This may be a very US centric view. I know other countries have different ways of paying for college educations. But here in the US it’s going to cost you tens of thousands of dollars at minimum.

I&#x27;m a primary school teacher but I taught myself to code many years ago - I bought a palm pilot in 2000 and started writing little shareware apps for it. I&#x27;ve been building side projects (mostly websites) ever since.  I&#x27;d love to work full-time as a web developer.<p>I&#x27;m proficient in rails and php. I&#x27;m also learning js and vue . Over the years I&#x27;ve applied for several (remote) positions but I never get to the interview stage.  From a quick scan of my inbox, it&#x27;s mostly because I lack professional experience (8 companies). 2 companies turned me down due to lack of open source contributions (although I shared some code from side projects) and 1 company asked me to do a coding test but then turned me down because they didn&#x27;t like my solution (it was a simple string manipulation and I wrote a simple method - they&#x27;d have preferred it if I wrote a new String class). There are also many companies I&#x27;ve applied to who never bothered to write back.

Many thanks<p>a brief description.<p>BEYOND SELF is an online web and mobile application, enabling anyone with a smart phone or mobile device that can play apps to access free fitness programs.  Designed after working years in a gym, seeing people join, without the funds available to hire a real life personal trainer, and yet also unable to devote the time needed to develop a sensible personal workout plan.  Without any guide, people often train inefficiently at best, and often will become discouraged and quit training altogether (forfeiting the hundreds spent on an annual membership after just weeks).<p>This app allows anyone, from beginner to most advanced, to access free or very low cost training programs.  These programs are not exclusive to gym users, there are over 300 workouts and growing, ranging from one isolated muscle to full body packages, from traditional gym to outdoors to at home, from hypertrophy to fat burning to body weight only.  Also one can make custom programs.<p>Included free in every package (even the free packages) is a nutrition planning building software tool where anyone can plan or track nutrition behavior.

I&#x27;m currently making over $380k in a very well funded startup and live remote in a no income state. I&#x27;m in my 20s and everyday, I wake up, work, play games, look at my investments and sleep. I&#x27;m pretty introverted and read a ton of books on investments and don&#x27;t go out much. I&#x27;m not an unsocial person per se, but I&#x27;m in a small town and it&#x27;s hard to make friends here. I thought about moving back to Bay Area but the 12% income tax and $2k rents goes against every frugality principal I was brought up in (I currently pay $500 for rent and 0% state income tax).<p>Having said that, this lifestyle has been taking a huge toll on me. I won&#x27;t say I&#x27;m depressed, but I&#x27;m becoming so disillusioned with life. I&#x27;ve so much goddam wealth that literally everything comes easy. I&#x27;ve travel oversea frequently in a hope to feel alive - and for a short time I do. Drugs, women, crazy adventures. Then I come back to this small town and it seems like there&#x27;s nothing to strive for. I have everything I want in life. Nothing is a challenge anymore.  The other day I randomly bought a house for $45k in cash so I can rent it out, but i kinda lost motivation after the first week<p>Anyone feel like that? I feel completely directionless. I tried going to meetups and everything but I can&#x27;t connect with anyone because our interests are so different.","time":1514601531,"title":"Ask HN: I made a ridiculous amount of money and feel “depressed”","type":"story"},{"by":"stablemap","descendants":1,"id":16033074,"kids":[16033101,16033080],"score":7,"time":1514594895,"title":"Squeezing a key through a carry bit [video]","type":"story","url":"https://media.ccc.de/v/34c3-9021-squeezing_a_key_through_a_carry_bit"},{"by":"sacert","descendants":23,"id":16032889,"kids":[16033453,16034077,16033193,16033476,16034669,16033219,16033454,16034504,16035215],"score":82,"time":1514591901,"title":"Show HN: Simple Gameboy Emulator","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/sacert/Gameboy"},{"by":"0x4f3759df","descendants":8,"id":16032805,"kids":[16033204,16036221,16041143,16033706,16034041,16033939],"score":38,"time":1514590654,"title":"How Ripple could succeed but XRP be worth nothing","type":"story","url":"https://publication.widmerdun.com/how-ripple-could-succeed-but-xrp-be-worth-nothing-4c2c5152d184"},{"by":"DyslexicAtheist","descendants":5,"id":16032739,"kids":[16034146,16033837],"score":17,"time":1514589783,"title":"How Alice and Bob meet if they don't like onions","type":"story","url":"https://media.ccc.de/v/34c3-9104-how_alice_and_bob_meet_if_they_don_t_like_onions"},{"by":"bostik","descendants":125,"id":16032643,"kids":[16034914,16034729,16035297,16034698,16034654,16034747,16034931,16036269,16034804,16034671,16034905],"score":155,"time":1514588764,"title":"Dude, You Broke the Future [video]","type":"story","url":"https://media.ccc.de/v/34c3-9270-dude_you_broke_the_future"},{"by":"chejazi","descendants":18,"id":16032640,"kids":[16033417,16033456,16033387,16033570,16033350,16035360,16033822],"score":42,"time":1514588729,"title":"The Christmas crypto correction.

However I would never buy Bitcoins as I consider the mining idea a very weak link of the Bitcoin.<p>Overall however I think cryptocurrencies can only be good for society, so I was trying to thing of an alternative. How can we have a cryptocurrency that doesn&#x27;t generate coins out of thin air(or lot&#x27;s of pointless calculations)?<p>The answer I came up with is by providing a service that people would find useful. One such service could be international money transfers.<p>So the idea I have is something along the lines of distributed ledger for facilitating international money transfers. If user A in US wants to transfer money to user B in Germany, they could find their local US exchange and buy $100 worth of FXCoins and send them to user B. User B then would go to his local Germany exchange and trade back the FXCoins for Euros.<p>That way the market would truly take care of pricing the FXCoin correctly and would not become a bubble. Also it will be more like a currency, a medium to transfer wealth, rather than an speculative investment.<p>However I have very little knowledge about the blockchain technology and wanted to ask HN folks if they see any technical difficulties in doing something like this?<p>For example, I was wondering if the blockchain can work without mining.

Because I can affect my circumstances and mitigate the bad parts, quitting has always felt like giving up, so I&#x27;ve found ways to continue.

Nothing I can imagine stacks up to it. At the moment I want nothing to do with it, but I think that&#x27;s fueled by my burnout. If that&#x27;s the case, it seems silly to switch to a different career. How do I get past this burnout so I can think clearly and be &quot;myself&quot; again?<p>Best idea I have is to take a couple months off and try to recover from my burnout, and hope it becomes clear what I&#x27;d like to do next -- even if it&#x27;s a similar role at another company.

And sometimes the motivation of free markets are at odds with the well being of our society as a whole.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear your ideas.<p>1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=15999322","time":1514162666,"title":"Ask HN: How to fix social welfare","type":"story"},{"by":"tosh","descendants":17,"id":16001912,"kids":[16007357,16007742,16007014,16008344],"score":219,"time":1514159726,"title":"Game developer’s guide to graphical projections","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/retronator-magazine/game-developers-guide-to-graphical-projections-with-video-game-examples-part-1-introduction-aa3d051c137d"},{"by":"dedalus","descendants":19,"id":16001826,"kids":[16006210,16005379,16005475,16005923],"score":85,"time":1514158109,"title":"The Area Under an ROC Curve (2001)","type":"story","url":"http://gim.unmc.edu/dxtests/roc3.htm"},{"by":"joseluisq","descendants":4,"id":16001763,"kids":[16001824,16006825,16003069],"score":5,"time":1514156604,"title":"2018 the year of the Linux desktop","type":"story","url":"https://www.linuxnewssite.com/2018-year-linux-desktop-24122017770.html"},{"by":"QAPereo","descendants":21,"id":16001776,"kids":[16006823,16006468,16007543,16023203,16008887,16006464],"score":120,"time":1514156943,"title":"Our Visual Imagination Is Severely Limited","type":"story","url":"https://undark.org/article/visual-imagination-brain-implications/"},{"by":"wtsui","descendants":84,"id":16001795,"kids":[16002248,16002508,16002267,16002121,16002325,16003528,16001947,16002106,16002942,16001862,16002863,16003377,16002976,16003193,16002726,16002763,16003055,16002298,16006780,16001943,16003970,16004033,16002035,16002116,16003473,16006549,16002469,16002076,16002977],"score":215,"time":1514157444,"title":"Show HN: Solo – App for sharing loneliness and aloneness","type":"story","url":"http://www.sharesolo.com"},{"by":"jseliger","descendants":18,"id":16001666,"kids":[16001828,16001815,16002790,16002395,16002999],"score":41,"time":1514154845,"title":"LG Develops ‘Nano IPS’ LCD, Unveils 32“ 4K Display with DCI-P3, HDR600, TB3","type":"story","url":"https://www.anandtech.com/show/12187/lg-develops-nano-ips-lcd-announces-32uk950-4k-display"},{"by":"mattbgates","descendants":3,"id":16001616,"kids":[16002030,16002142,16002236],"score":19,"text":"Ladies, gentleman, hackers, entrepreneurs, daily readers, occasional readers, and seldom readers alike:<p>Whatever you celebrate... enjoy yourself, enjoy your time with family, enjoy time off from work, enjoy the holidays.
