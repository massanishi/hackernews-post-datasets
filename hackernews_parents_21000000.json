Better employment opportunities outside of web development work: I am aware that some positions e.g. AI, ML are pretty much restricted to those with master&#x27;s or PhDs.<p>2. My undergraduate school was not the best in terms of education, and I would like to learn from a much better institution.

Answering this question is not definitely objective and depends on my background and my values. So I try to explain a little bit then I would like to get advice from you guys.<p>Currently I&#x27;m studying for my M.Sc in Vancouver. My field of research is natural language processing and more specifically neural machine translation. I recently published a paper in a workshop of a major NLP conference (EMNLP 2019) and attended the conference in Hong Kong. I also have two published papers in my undergrad in top tier conferences.<p>In my home country, I used to work as a software engineer in a top tech company in which millions of people were using our products and it was somehow the google of my country. I did software engineering 2 years part time and 1.5 years full time.<p>Why I&#x27;m struggling:<p>Advantage of software engineering to me:<p>1. Team work (much more than research)<p>2. Less stress compared to being a PhD student (you are worried about conference deadline and wether or not this idea is gonna work)<p>3. Features are delivered faster and you feel the impact.<p>4. You are directly having impact on your customers.<p>5. Good money -&gt; Use my youth \n-------------------<p>Advantages of a PhD:<p>1. Research is intellectually satisfying as f<i></i>k.<p>2. Diversity of the problems (Much more than engineering)<p>3. Future is AI.<p>I was not even considering pursuing a PhD but after attending the conference I got inspired but still have my doubts. If I pursue a PhD it takes a couple of years of my youth. You are still a student and students are somehow poor financially. I want to use my youth to explore life as much as possible.<p>The reason I&#x27;m asking it on HN rather than reddit is that people here are generally curious and understand what I mean by saying that research is very very intellectually satisfying.<p>Any advice for me to consider?","time":1573283487,"title":"Should I Pursue a PhD?","type":"story"},{"by":"tintinnabula","descendants":7,"id":21489881,"kids":[21490632,21490753,21493488,21490484,21490938,21493623],"score":68,"time":1573278690,"title":"Stellar Sonata","type":"story","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_Sonata"},{"by":"kburman","descendants":19,"id":21489877,"kids":[21499273,21497884,21500312,21498311,21498099,21500530,21499497],"score":178,"time":1573278562,"title":"Scientist: A Ruby library for carefully refactoring critical paths","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/github/scientist"},{"by":"ingve","descendants":7,"id":21489651,"kids":[21490178,21491726,21495343],"score":31,"time":1573274287,"title":"Building a keyboard from an old typewriter","type":"story","url":"http://cowlark.com/2019-11-03-keyboard/"},{"by":"pitzips","descendants":1,"id":21489645,"kids":[21492181,21490071],"score":2,"text":"I clicked the SiriusXM button on my 2014 Mazda Infotainment (not Android Auto) for the first time since buying the car in 2015.<p>5 seconds later I received an email from Google Nest for a 3-month trial for SiriusXM.

Additionally, they profit off of ads and apparently whoever decided to copy and rewrite my content didn&#x27;t see the &quot;Donate&quot; button mentioning we run off of basically nothing. No one ever reached out to me to ask if they could use any information on the site, they just read it and rewrote it terribly.<p>I&#x27;m posting this because this is the modern internet.

a recent HN discussion about the walrus operator I came to realize yet another advantage of notation.  I used APL professionally for about ten years, which made it an obvious source of inspiration for an example that, in my opinion, demonstrates why the Python team missed a very valuable opportunity to take this wonderful language and start exploring the judicious introduction of notation as a valuable tool for thought (borrowing from Ken Iverson&#x27;s APL paper with that title [0]).<p>To simplify, I&#x27;ll define the desire for this walrus operator &quot;:=&quot; as &quot;wanting to be able to make assignments within syntax where it was previously impossible&quot;:<p><pre><code>    if x = 5    # was impossible\n\n    # and now\n\n    if x := 5  # makes is possible\n</code></pre>\nA more elaborate example given in the PEP goes like this:<p><pre><code>    Current:\n\n    reductor = dispatch_table.get(cls)\n    if reductor:\n        rv = reductor(x)\n    else:\n        reductor = getattr(x, &quot;__reduce_ex__&quot;, None)\n        if reductor:\n            rv = reductor(4)\n        else:\n            reductor = getattr(x, &quot;__reduce__&quot;, None)\n            if reductor:\n                rv = reductor()\n            else:\n                raise Error(\n                    &quot;un(deep)copyable object of type %s&quot; % cls)\n\n    Improved:\n\n\n    if reductor := dispatch_table.get(cls):\n        rv = reductor(x)\n    elif reductor := getattr(x, &quot;__reduce_ex__&quot;, None):\n        rv = reductor(4)\n    elif reductor := getattr(x, &quot;__reduce__&quot;, None):\n        rv = reductor()\n    else:\n        raise Error(&quot;un(deep)copyable object of type %s&quot; % cls)\n \n</code></pre>\nAt first I thought, well, just extend &quot;=&quot; and be done with it.  The HN thread resulted in many comments against this idea.  The one that made me think was this one [1]:<p><pre><code>    These two are syntactically equal and in Python there&#x27;s no \n    way a linter can distinguish between these two:\n\n        if reductor = dispatch_table.get(cls):\n        if reductor == dispatch_table.get(cls):\n    \n    A human being can only distinguish them through careful inspection. \n    The walrus operator not only prevents that problem, but makes \n    the intent unambiguous.\n</code></pre>\nWhich is a perfectly valid point.  I get it.<p>Still, the idea of two assignment operators just didn&#x27;t sit well with me.  That&#x27;s when I realized I had seen this kind of a problem nearly thirty years ago, with the introduction of &quot;J&quot;.  I won&#x27;t get into the details unless someone is interested, I&#x27;ll just say that J turned APL into ASCII soup.  It was and is ugly and it completely misses the point of the very reason APL has specialized notation; the very thing Iverson highlighted in his paper [0].<p>Back to Python.<p>This entire mess could have been avoided by making one simple change that would have possibly nudged the language towards a very interesting era, one where a specialized programming notation could be evolved over time for the benefit of all.  That simple change would have been the introduction and adoption of APL&#x27;s own assignment operator: &quot;←&quot;<p>In other words, these two things would have been equivalent in Python:<p><pre><code>    a ← 23\n\n    a = 23\n</code></pre>\nWhat&#x27;s neat about this is that both human and automated tools (linters, etc.) would have no problem understanding the difference between these:<p><pre><code>    if reductor ← dispatch_table.get(cls):\n    if reductor == dispatch_table.get(cls):\n</code></pre>\nAnd the larger example would become this:<p><pre><code>    if reductor ← dispatch_table.get(cls):\n        rv ← reductor(x)\n    elif reductor ← getattr(x, &quot;__reduce_ex__&quot;, None):\n        rv ← reductor(4)\n    elif reductor ← getattr(x, &quot;__reduce__&quot;, None):\n        rv ← reductor()\n    else:\n        raise Error(&quot;un(deep)copyable object of type %s&quot; % cls)\n</code></pre>\nThis assignment operator would work everywhere and, for a period of time, the &quot;=&quot; operator would be retained.  The good news is that old code could be updated with a simple search-and-replace.  In fact, code editors could even display &quot;=&quot; as &quot;←&quot; as an option.  The transition to only allowing &quot;←&quot; (and perhaps other symbols) could be planned for Python 4.<p>Clean, simple and forward-looking.  That, to me, is a good solution.  Today we have &quot;=&quot; and &quot;:=&quot; which, from my opinionated perspective, does not represent progress at all.<p>[0] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eecg.toronto.edu&#x2F;~jzhu&#x2F;csc326&#x2F;readings&#x2F;iverson.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eecg.toronto.edu&#x2F;~jzhu&#x2F;csc326&#x2F;readings&#x2F;iverson.pd...</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21426338\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21426338</a>","time":1572977081,"title":"Python should take a lesson from APL: Walrus operator not needed","type":"story"},{"by":"virtuallyvivek","descendants":4,"id":21454873,"kids":[21454900,21459101],"score":8,"time":1572977046,"title":"I dug through US census data and ranked the top remote work cities","type":"story","url":"https://pragli.com/blog/us-remote-trends/"},{"by":"peter_d_sherman","descendants":17,"id":21454851,"kids":[21456582,21456815,21456171,21455489,21455515,21454860,21461609,21472849,21456348,21458648,21460886],"score":63,"time":1572976977,"title":"Photoacoustic Effect","type":"story","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoacoustic_effect"},{"by":"oleks","descendants":6,"id":21454717,"kids":[21455124,21459663],"score":42,"time":1572976246,"title":"World Scientists’ Warning of a Climate Emergency","type":"story","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biz088"},{"by":"Reedx","descendants":53,"id":21454727,"kids":[21455007,21456188,21455915,21461150,21459930,21457100,21456806,21455640,21456848,21455178,21455321,21455721],"score":185,"time":1572976319,"title":"Super-precise new CRISPR tool could tackle a plethora of genetic diseases","type":"story","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03164-5"},{"by":"jaden","descendants":23,"id":21454707,"kids":[21457150,21461469,21455831,21455937,21456520,21458480,21456388,21455636,21456023],"score":34,"time":1572976208,"title":"Office Chair Is Hurting You","type":"story","url":"https://elemental.medium.com/your-office-chair-is-hurting-you-882e07c20ff7"},{"by":"indifferentalex","descendants":1,"id":21454530,"kids":[21459004,21456272],"score":11,"time":1572975112,"title":"Italian customers cannot access Shopify sites for over a week","type":"story","url":"https://status.shopify.com/"},{"by":"gsvclass","descendants":3,"id":21454515,"kids":[21457344,21455265],"score":11,"time":1572975015,"title":"Show HN: An Instant Go Powered GraphQL API for Postgres.

You can check it out here:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.useprototype.com<p>We were fed up with creating the same sort of APIs over and over again when building web applications so we built this tool for ourselves. As we&#x27;re all in university, we showed it around to our friends and they enjoyed using it to kickstart their projects. After that, we thought we&#x27;d host it on a website and allow anybody to use it!<p>ProtoType is different from similar GraphQL backend builders such as 8base in that it focuses on data modeling. All you need to do is model your data then hit deploy (no dealing with relational tables). Once you hit deploy, ProtoType will automatically generate and deploy a GraphQL server that supports your data models.<p>On the roadmap is migrations, tutorials, roles&#x2F;permissions, live server logs, and data metrics (how much your models are created, read, updated, and deleted).<p>Looking forward to all of your feedback!<p>The ProtoType team","time":1572969123,"title":"Show HN: Prototype – build GraphQL backends without code","type":"story"},{"by":"brlewis","descendants":3,"id":21453332,"kids":[21457894,21454909],"score":15,"time":1572968579,"title":"Hacker News Guidelines","type":"story","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html"},{"by":"formalsystem","descendants":37,"id":21453318,"kids":[21457543,21456354,21455812,21455834,21459162,21458752,21458544,21460106,21457939,21456506,21455395],"score":115,"time":1572968463,"title":"How to Turn Physics into an Optimization Problem","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@marksaroufim/how-to-turn-physics-into-an-optimization-problem-11b3fbf83062"},{"by":"throwaway413","descendants":2,"id":21453968,"kids":[21454114,21461606],"score":3,"time":1572971982,"title":"Dog Learning to Talk by Using a Custom Soundboard to Speak","type":"story","url":"https://people.com/pets/dog-learning-to-talk-by-using-a-custom-soundboard-to-speak-im-in-constant-amazement/"},{"by":"buboard","descendants":12,"id":21453242,"kids":[21453557,21454341,21453801,21454145],"score":23,"time":1572968037,"title":"Without Free Speech, All Speech Becomes Government Speech","type":"story","url":"https://fee.org/articles/without-free-speech-all-speech-becomes-government-speech/"},{"by":"roskilli","descendants":35,"id":21453101,"kids":[21454482,21454595,21453804,21455513,21453542,21454170,21453777,21457348,21454500,21460873,21455419,21454215,21453723,21455324,21454085,21453144,21464964],"score":120,"time":1572967186,"title":"Chronosphere launches with $11M Series A to build scalable monitoring tool","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/05/chronosphere-launches-with-11m-series-a-to-build-scalable-cloud-native-monitoring-tool/"},{"by":"juice_bus","descendants":272,"id":21452953,"kids":[21455053,21454565,21454301,21457169,21454930,21456492,21454974,21455876,21455069,21455158,21453991,21458633,21454346,21460093,21456320,21456638,21456603,21454291,21458962,21456693],"score":282,"time":1572966198,"title":"C++ 20: The Core Language","type":"story","url":"https://www.modernescpp.com/index.php/c-20-the-core-language"},{"by":"reddotX","descendants":152,"id":21452926,"kids":[21453475,21453663,21454157,21453949,21453404,21455002,21453291,21453271,21453655],"score":115,"time":1572966035,"title":"German government expands subsidies for electric cars","type":"story","url":"https://www.dw.com/en/german-government-expands-subsidies-for-electric-cars/a-51113225"},{"by":"theophrastus","descendants":2,"id":21452874,"kids":[21453279,21452901],"score":5,"time":1572965684,"title":"With a Laser, Researchers Say They Can Hack Alexa, Google Home or Siri","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/technology/digital-assistant-laser-hack.html"},{"by":"Liriel","descendants":28,"id":21452830,"kids":[21453167,21453421],"score":64,"time":1572965454,"title":"JavaScript Errors: An Exceptional History","type":"story","url":"https://blog.appsignal.com/2019/10/17/javascript-errors-an-exceptional-history.html"},{"by":"a0-prw","dead":true,"id":21452773,"kids":[21453477,21453473,21453518],"score":10,"time":1572965111,"title":"ABC news had the Epstein story 3 years ago","type":"story","url":"https://www.projectveritas.com/2019/11/05/video-leaked-insider-recording-from-abc-news-reveals-network-executives-killed-bombshell-story-implicating-jeffrey-epstein/"},{"by":"throwawayt856","descendants":2,"id":21452769,"kids":[21453027,21452819],"score":5,"text":"After almost 8 years, I am trying to switch career from customer service to web dev.

the last hour a few HN threads came to my attention [0][1][2], from which it seems that the overt kind of bullying that is known from movies and television series is actually a real thing. I am talking about repeated physical abuse from peers (but if somebody has deeper insights about bullying in general, I would not mind hearing about that too), because that is the thing that I thought mainly existed on TV.<p>If you have witnessed or, especially, suffered from bullying; I would like to read about it, at what education stage did it happen and where it happened. The last part is because my first thought about the beatings being real was that it is something that is exacerbated in USA schools.<p>As for my own experience (since I am asking others about it, I feel obligated to share my own experience); I was a socially inept introverted kid with little confidence and an outsider who could not really connect with other kids (and quite an annoying little prick, as I understand now), but despite those circumstances I was not repeatedly beaten (although a troublemaking kid that was shortly in my  school during the lower education stage once tried to beat me up with two other people from my class, they failed). In high school there was even less bullying.<p>Now, I may have been lucky, it is possible that my schools were uncommonly nice ones in Croatia, and the fact that I was encouraged to stand up to beating attempts (on me or my friends) after reading the &quot;Ender&#x27;s game&quot; (because of Ender doing the same ...); but really my understanding is that beatings do not happen in Croatian schools as described in those threads. Is it because of the Croatian nondemocratic socialist government heritage? Or is it an European thing? That is why I am asking this question.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21212587\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21212587</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=5284664\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=5284664</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21447459\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21447459</a>","time":1572951187,"title":"Ask HN: Do you have experience with school bullying?","type":"story"},{"by":"andyljones","descendants":7,"id":21451217,"kids":[21451282,21458756,21451221],"score":17,"time":1572950588,"title":"You now need an annual license to own or fly a drone in the UK","type":"story","url":"https://www.caa.co.uk/Consumers/Unmanned-aircraft/Our-role/Drone-and-model-aircraft-registration/"},{"by":"groomed","descendants":103,"id":21451178,"kids":[21451380,21451241,21451428,21451306,21451391,21451285,21451379,21451602,21451409,21451239,21451381,21451513,21451458,21451480,21451669,21453316,21451831,21453224,21451584,21452018,21556744,21452306,21451442,21451502,21451451,21451277,21451589,21451606,21454509,21451332,21457905,21451343,21452300],"score":53,"text":"Who really cares about algorithm on daily bases.

1 &amp; 2 were launched more than 40 years ago and next year will be <i>operating</i> 40 years beyond their mission schedule.<p>Given the technology of the early 70s (very large feature size, very low level of integration, wide traces, probably not CMOS, etc) it&#x27;s been possible to understand them well enough to keep them running and repurpose them.  The more modern mars rovers also exceeded their mission lifespans by several times, but had ultimate lifetimes of about 15 years.  And I note that one of the probes had an early failure of flash memory, something that didn&#x27;t even exist in 1975.  So while they exceeded their mission by more than 30X, in absolute time it was much shorter than Voyager.<p>But outside that kind of almost unlimited budget environment are we still building things with unanticipated lifespans?    Everything from electronics to housing is optimized for cost of manufacture, not long term operating value.  And that extends far enough through the stack (from semiconductor to UI) that I wonder if design for the long term is even <i>possible</i>.<p>Sure, a few hackers can reflash an old phone to be a TV remote, but the bulk of the population can&#x27;t or can&#x27;t be bothered.  More dangerously, in a few years people will be scattering IoT devices willy-nilly in fields, over provisioning because it&#x27;s OK if a few fail if you have enough running.  When they stop working they&#x27;ll just drop more, newer ones in; it won&#x27;t be worth picking up the old ones which will just become e-waste in situ.<p>Is it even reasonable to want active devices to be designed with long lifetimes?

Many manufacturers have followed, and USB-C is very common on many devices already. Virtually every device I connect to my Mac on a daily basis uses a USB-C connector. So it follows that 4 ports are no longer enough when I&#x27;m doing lots of stuff. For example, right now I want to connect:<p>* USB-C External SSD for music&#x2F;movie library.\n* USB-C External HDD for time machine backups.\n* USB-C Ethernet adapter for LAN.\n* USB-C to Lightning to iPad for Xcode debugging.\n* USB-C Power Cable.<p>As you can see, that is more than 4 ports can handle.

This tool is not _cheap_ persay, a bit costly, but offers its value x 10 of its cost. The leadership has given 0 feedback on this tool choice to buy e.g. it costs too much, or we dont have the money or anything.<p>- Some team members get quarterly bonuses paid out and have been for the last year. Evidentially in the middle of this past quarter the CEO sends an all hands email saying theyre stopping quarterly bonuses and switching to every year bonus to be paid out the following year end of january.

The documentation is integrated with their design tools so that it’s always up-to-date, which enables large design and development teams to stay on the same page, ship faster and deliver consistent user experiences.<p>Documentation is the first piece of the puzzle – our vision is to enable any company in the world to have a &quot;design system&quot;: a system of reusable UX and front-end components, tools and guidelines. We want companies that don’t have the resources of design giants like Salesforce, IBM and Shopify to be able to create design systems which are just as powerful e.g. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lightningdesignsystem.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lightningdesignsystem.com</a> (Salesforce), <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.carbondesignsystem.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.carbondesignsystem.com</a> (IBM), <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;polaris.shopify.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;polaris.shopify.com</a> (Shopify)<p>Our startup journey started 4 years ago at a YC Startup School event in London – it was the final push of inspiration we needed to make the jump and quit our Big Finance Co programming jobs :) We joined Entrepreneur First (a pre-seed incubator) with a list of startup ideas (including some really bad ones!) and spent most of our time emailing people and going for coffees. For two coders who were excited to code and build a product, this was a tough reality check of what starting a startup can be like in the beginning!<p>At the time, one problem that really resonated with people was that the design-development handoff process was pretty painful. This was something we had experienced at work: designers sending manually annotated PDF specs and PNG assets as email attachments etc. We thought it was an exciting space, so we went ahead and built a design-development handoff tool.<p>The problem was that there were already some great products in the space that had a head start – such as Zeplin (YC S15) :) – so despite gaining some customer traction, it wasn&#x27;t enough for us to raise money. This led us to go back to basics: talk to users...<p>So we went for coffee with our customers to figure out what other problems we could solve in the space and built the following series of insights:<p>- Good design is now the default, most products need a great user experience to compete<p>- Because of this, companies are spending a lot more resources on design&#x2F;UX and growing their design teams rapidly<p>- In order to be able to collaborate at scale, design teams have started adopting a component-based workflow – similar to how engineers have worked for years<p>- But breaking designs down into components is not enough. In order to successfully collaborate at scale, designers and front-end coders need written documentation on _how_ to use the components. The design components are the lego bricks and the design documentation is the much needed lego instruction manual.<p>So what’s the problem? We dug deeper and found that there are two hurdles that tend to prevent companies from creating successful documentation for their design system.<p>1. Companies that _do_ have the front-end engineering resources to build custom design documentation in-house (or leverage a tool like Storybook) often end up with engineer-driven documentation that is up-to-date with production code, but is hard for non-technical designers to contribute to. This leads those designers to create their own, separate documentation, which in turn causes fragmentation between design and development teams — one of the problems that having a design system is trying to combat in the first place!<p>2. Companies that _don&#x27;t_ have the spare front-end engineering resources to build custom docs use tools like Confluence, Google Docs, Notion etc. but these types of wiki tools aren&#x27;t built for purpose and the documentation can easily end up out of sync with the latest designs and code<p>Based on this we built a minimal yet powerful editor (in the spirit of Dropbox Paper or Notion) that makes it very easy for anyone to document their reusable UX components, tools and guidelines (their “design system”). The editor is integrated with both design and development tools so that the docs stay up-to-date. On the design side we provide Sketch, Figma and Adobe XD plugins to sync UX components and styles. Designers can update the designs inside the docs at the click of a button without having to leave their design tools. On the engineering side we offer Codepen-like interactive previews as well as the ability to embed Storybook stories – so designs and front-end code can live side-by-side in the docs.<p>In order for it to be easily accessible by the entire company (and possibly made public), the documentation can be published as a standalone website and shared with anyone using a link (or protected with a password)<p>To get a better idea of what a zeroheight docs site looks like when shared, check out this example site from one of our users (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zeroheight.com&#x2F;22mjgbuf6&#x2F;p&#x2F;56796c\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zeroheight.com&#x2F;22mjgbuf6&#x2F;p&#x2F;56796c</a>) or our demo site (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.zeroheight.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.zeroheight.com</a>)<p>That’s all for now... we’d love to hear your thoughts on what we’re building in the comments below!<p>PS: if you’re a full-stack &#x2F;

what it really means to do DevOps in 2019:\n- Forget what the books said, theory, semantics and idealism. You are a DevOps Engineer, working in a platform specific team.<p>- You deal with Jenkins or similar, and consult other teams or developers to write scripts for it, or worse, do the work for them since they&#x27;re too busy doing actual programming.<p>- You are not allowed to come up with your own abstractions. Proposals to develop anything are automatically declined by your Product Owner, who simply points you to whatever tool with a fancy logo he could find listed in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.<p>- You pride yourself for being an engineer, but decisions end up being only made in terms of getting free open source labor and ease up hiring, so you end up doing what everyone else is doing.<p>- Half of your team co-workers are perfectly fine dealing with churn, software updates and other sort of manual, classic sysadmin tasks.<p>- You are repeatedly being paged at night for problems that your fellow developers won&#x27;t feel responsible for. You hear buzzwords and talks about this SRE thing or &quot;you built it, you run it&quot;, but it never seems to materialise due to politics.<p>It used to be a lot of fun back in the day, and a great chance to get paid to solve interesting problems related to system and infrastructure engineering instead of the boring CRUD work that plagued the last decades, but seeing the &quot;App Store&quot; that this turned into, if you are a creative individual with a software engineering background and you&#x27;re considering a career in DevOps, my advice is to run away while you can.<p>I wonder what developers are actually thinking about DevOps?","time":1572494290,"title":"Ask HN: What are the pros and cons of DevOps?","type":"story"},{"by":"appwiz","descendants":4,"id":21405583,"kids":[21411514,21412312],"score":59,"time":1572493923,"title":"Data Laced with History: Causal Trees and Operational CRDTs (2018)","type":"story","url":"http://archagon.net/blog/2018/03/24/data-laced-with-history/"},{"by":"thescribbblr","descendants":9,"id":21405705,"kids":[21406892,21409601,21406991,21415047,21406114,21405900,21407318,21414048],"score":12,"time":1572495333,"title":"Ask HN: What's your best startup idea?","type":"story"},{"by":"mkj","descendants":92,"id":21405519,"kids":[21412660,21413557,21412746,21412614,21411410,21405827,21410844,21414848,21414566,21416180,21414694,21411122,21412625,21411136,21411455],"score":154,"time":1572492936,"title":"FastSpark: A New Fast Native Implementation of Spark from Scratch","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@rajasekar3eg/fastspark-a-new-fast-native-implementation-of-spark-from-scratch-368373a29a5c"},{"by":"anonfunction","descendants":60,"id":21405501,"kids":[21405717,21405958,21405883,21406390,21405753,21417137,21405762,21405711,21406180,21406153,21405944,21405879,21406537,21407565,21411153,21405778,21405975,21409870,21406173,21406055,21409661,21412883,21405782,21405894,21406177,21408692,21405857,21418409,21406054,21405714,21407936,21406225,21406120,21406354,21405774,21407536,21406408],"score":81,"text":"When building services that rely on relational databases, in my case postgres, what are some best practices and tools to help manage schema changes?<p>We&#x27;ve been using migrations and doing it all manually but it&#x27;s become a bottleneck and a little bit of a nightmare with multiple consumers of the database needing to make schema changes.<p>Another concern is multiple environments, from local development to staging and production.

Then I used a lot of floats to make web pages, and kinda like the way.<p>Responsive Design was my next goal, so CSS Framework was the Easiest way for Responsiveness, I tried to read docs and watched Bootstrap Videos but Bootstrap terrified me with lots of classes and inconvenient naming, and I didn&#x27;t like to use bootstrap cause I think every website using Bootstrap looks quite similar it also applies styles on element as defaults, I tried two or more times but didn&#x27;t get Bootstrap in my mind, so I found some alternatives like Foundation and Material, but they were just like Bootstrap. I just wanted to make my site Responsive, and then I found the video of Brad Traversy Skeleton CSS<p>I loved Skeleton CSS but now their devs are not updating it, its not based on CSS grid or Flexbox. There were some confusions in it, and Then I found Bulma , I was just using YouTube as usual and then I came to Bulma.css Tutorial Video tagged “The Easiest Framework You can learn in 20 minutes”, Hmm I watched it and it really changed my life, It was really the easiest framework, even you don&#x27;t have to remember the classes and there are some of the advantages :<p>No default Styling\nPowerful

We also benefit from being a niche search-engine that lets us make strong assumptions about the data we index thereby allowing us to cater to the needs of our users more efficiently.<p>As of now we index data primarily from the r&#x2F;tinder subreddit, but we are working on incorporating content from other meme based subs and to provide specific functionality for each of them.","time":1572452483,"title":"Show HN: askgoose – a search engine for your online wingman needs","type":"story"},{"by":"talhof8","descendants":3,"id":21399379,"kids":[21399391,21408535],"score":3,"time":1572452444,"title":"Show HN: Jiggy –  an AI powered app that makes people in your photos dance","type":"story","url":"https://apps.apple.com/app/jiggy-magical-dance-gif-maker/id1482608709"},{"by":"bmahmood","descendants":17,"id":21399284,"kids":[21399311,21403375,21411550,21399965,21402897,21402773,21405578,21402068],"score":65,"time":1572451996,"title":"Show HN: ClearBrain (YC W18) – Automated Causal Analytics","type":"story","url":"http://www.clearbrain.com"},{"by":"AndrewBissell","descendants":397,"id":21399034,"kids":[21399482,21399163,21400271,21399328,21401047,21399877,21401421,21400845,21399513,21399224,21399254,21399904,21404123,21399544,21399352,21400956,21399441,21401500,21399342,21399853,21399911,21399587,21404810,21402522,21401249,21402121,21404218,21399926,21406150,21402431,21399937,21402146,21441234,21400405,21399216,21404923,21399753,21399347,21401007,21399445],"score":697,"time":1572450671,"title":"Epstein's injuries look more like murder than suicide, noted pathologist says","type":"story","url":"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article236809668.html"},{"by":"chibicode","descendants":3,"id":21399025,"kids":[21400895,21412985],"score":3,"time":1572450592,"title":"Y Combinator for Non-Programmers","type":"story","url":"https://ycombinator.chibicode.com/"},{"by":"ricg","descendants":3,"id":21399175,"kids":[21399243,21399559],"score":3,"time":1572451408,"title":"Show HN: Boards for Mac – task board and personal organizer app (beta)","type":"story","url":"http://kitestack.com/boards/"},{"by":"jxy","descendants":20,"id":21398976,"kids":[21426661,21424152,21421971,21427841,21428218,21424315,21428613,21423156,21426886,21423565,21428582],"score":79,"time":1572450342,"title":"BrainNet: A Multi-Person Brain-to-Brain Interface","type":"story","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41895-7"},{"by":"aeontech","descendants":91,"id":21398893,"kids":[21402053,21399261,21402614,21400974,21400836,21407958,21403710,21402005,21408075,21400993,21407049,21400589,21402060],"score":114,"time":1572449827,"title":" A military historian’s analysis of Spartan myth","type":"story","url":"https://acoup.blog/category/collections/this-isnt-sparta/"},{"by":"s_r_n","descendants":13,"id":21398803,"kids":[21398983,21398870,21398882,21398886,21401146,21398907,21398837,21398900],"score":4,"text":"I saw an article today where Steve Wozniak said he didn&#x27;t think autonomous cars would come to fruition during his lifetime.

I order products through a drop ship wholesaler. Our wholesale outlet is one of the msot respected in the country and purchases only from verified trademark holders for redistribution. Because of the numbers involved, the manufacturers might not know my name. However, I have an account in good standing with the wholesaler. I list my products on Amazon by means of a data feed directly from the wholesaler. Occasionally a manufacturer&#x2F;trademark holder may grow concerned about counterfeit products offered on Amazon and submit blanket complaints about every retailer they see on Amazon whose name they do not recognize. When this happens I immediately contact the wholesaler to ask for a letter of verification and an introduction to the manufacturer&#x2F;trademark holders as proof that I sell products sourced only from the trademark holder - not couterfeits. I also request and receive letters of verification from the manufacturer&#x2F;trademark holder. Once these documents have been submitted Amazon stopped communicating with me.<p>After several weeks of sending automated e-mails Amazon suspended my account and held the funds for the sales I had already completed. When I requested the release of the funds, Amazon sent an automated e-mail saying Amazon will not release the funds, they will not provide the reason and will no longer communicate with me. The customer paid me, not Amazon,for the merchandidse I delivered. This money does not belong to Amazon. The maneuver of not transmitting to me the proceeds of my sales does not seem to be even legal. The use of robot e-mail replies on Amazon&#x27;s part hints to mym mind at fraudulent intent.<p>I believe this process of (1) Accusing a seller of wrongdoing (2) Ignoring a seller&#x27;s defense (3) Holding the seller&#x27;s balance due presumably for be kept as Amazon&#x27;s personal business property - this process is a generalized fraudulent scheme.","time":1572448774,"title":"Amazon's Fraudulent Practices to Sellers","type":"story"},{"by":"dnetesn","descendants":60,"id":21398715,"kids":[21404342,21399708,21401197,21399822,21402747,21400274,21400331,21399990,21401184,21401356,21399686,21399792,21399898],"score":266,"time":1572449026,"title":"Nautilus to be acquired by an investor group of fans","type":"story","url":"http://nautil.us/blog/nautilus-to-be-acquired-by-ownership-group-of-super_fans"},{"by":"throw0101a","descendants":2,"id":21398552,"kids":[21398573,21398655],"score":5,"time":1572448143,"title":"The Toxic Bubble of Technical Debt Threatening America","type":"story","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/10/california-fires-and-pge-toxic-debt/600979/"},{"by":"omneity","descendants":24,"id":21398524,"kids":[21403450,21398526,21404589,21479148,21402746,21404577,21404912,21401185,21423242,21406414],"score":49,"time":1572447958,"title":"Show HN: Monitor websites for change and get scraped data in a webhook","type":"story","url":"https://www.monitoro.xyz"},{"by":"sudoaza","descendants":18,"id":21398634,"kids":[21398960,21399108],"score":16,"time":1572448593,"title":"US Journalist arrested after reporting on Venezuela","type":"story","url":"https://thegrayzone.com/2019/10/28/this-charge-is-one-hundred-percent-false-grayzone-editor-max-blumenthal-arrested-months-after-reporting-on-venezuelan-opposition-violence/"},{"by":"simonebrunozzi","descendants":3,"id":21398488,"kids":[21420365,21420091,21423810],"score":11,"time":1572447811,"title":"The Career of Mountaineer Fred Beckey","type":"story","url":"https://lithub.com/jon-krakauer-on-the-incredible-career-of-mountaineer-fred-beckey/"},{"by":"rookhack","descendants":56,"id":21398331,"kids":[21398779,21398590,21399107,21398826,21398773,21398855,21399204,21398614,21398774,21398811,21398904,21399160,21406739,21398545,21399377],"score":47,"time":1572446925,"title":"How to not get scammed hiring remote freelancers on Upwork","type":"story","url":"https://jamesclift.ca/how-to-not-get-scammed-hiring-remote-freelancers-on-upwork-bfc6d215d22e"},{"by":"imartin2k","descendants":6,"id":21398697,"kids":[21399418,21399993,21400505,21401205],"score":18,"time":1572448943,"title":"How China is using QR codes","type":"story","url":"https://a16z.com/2019/10/30/the-power-of-qr-codes/"},{"by":"teko_ji","descendants":4,"id":21398139,"kids":[21399008,21399293],"score":5,"time":1572445857,"title":"Notifications via JSON for Android and iOS","type":"story","url":"https://refl.me/docs"},{"by":"chrisa","descendants":2,"id":21398095,"kids":[21405271,21399384],"score":82,"time":1572445591,"title":"DNS Record Crash Course for Web Developers","type":"story","url":"https://dev.to/chrisachard/dns-record-crash-course-for-web-developers-35hn"},{"by":"vanburen","descendants":51,"id":21398038,"kids":[21399035,21398229,21398160,21399246,21400494,21400887,21400300],"score":137,"time":1572445288,"title":"SiFive Announces First RISC-V OoO CPU Core","type":"story","url":"https://www.anandtech.com/show/15036/sifive-announces-first-riscv-ooo-cpu-core-the-u8series-processor-ip"},{"by":"ianki","descendants":107,"id":21398025,"kids":[21400687,21398866,21399092,21399331,21399333,21399694,21398555,21399159,21401265,21400674,21398792,21401130,21399585,21402210,21404037,21399339,21400319,21402696,21400759,21400851,21401898,21404230,21404078,21399601,21400622,21405045,21403880,21399582,21405662,21399005,21399360,21400600,21399855,21406214,21398859],"score":201,"time":1572445237,"title":"Feeling stuck?

We have recently been given evidence that on multiple occasions (2005, 2015) the US Navy witnessed UAP&#x2F;UFO aircraft on radar, infrared, and by highly trained pilots. It is the official stance of the US Navy that these aircraft are exactly that: aircraft; not sensor glitches, foreign psy-ops&#x2F;jamming, etc. By all accounts, the UAP were observed by these sensor platforms and pilots performing maneuvers which indicate intelligent control and technology beyond what we can duplicate at present, no matter how hard we try. Each person must set their own standard for proof, but for me pilots, radar, and infrared is enough. I think that&#x27;s a real UFO on those videos and I don&#x27;t care where it came from, I only see opportunity.<p>In the history of humanity our research efforts, hence our advancement, has always been bound by the dreams of visionaries and hampered by the dead ends of failed&#x2F;wrong ideas. To actually have a working piece of highly advanced technology paraded through our best attempt at a floating radar range is the greatest advantage that we have ever come upon. This is a technological goalpost for us, it shows us what is actually possible, and informs our research efforts as to which directions are likely fruitful. Such a guiding hand in our development has never been extended before and I feel we are profoundly stupid to ignore it.<p>I ask the members of this community who also feels that this evidence is sufficient to apply their excess brainpower towards extracting knowledge from these events. We need to figure out everything we can from this and start the conversation within the scientific and technological communities about how we can gain from it. Also, I argue that any knowledge gained needs to be open sourced and that this will only happen if more IQ outside of government is thinking about it than inside. This community could easily ensure that.

(<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.drivecarve.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.drivecarve.com</a>)<p>Carve is a car sharing marketplace where you can rent cars from local dealerships. So if you don’t own a car but need one for a few days, you can get a car that fits your needs at a reasonable price.<p>We built this product because when we moved to New York after college, we both gave up cars, and even though most places we needed to be were easily accessible via Subway or Lyft, there were still lots of things we wanted to do that we couldn&#x27;t using public transit or ride share apps. When it came to leaving the city to ski in Vermont or hike upstate, for example, the existing options were all either expensive (Zipcar, Car2Go), inconvenient (Avis, Hertz), or inconsistent (Turo, Getaround).<p>Sam and I are both from the Midwest, so neither of us are strangers to car dealerships—drive ten miles in any direction from our childhood homes and you&#x27;ll see massive lots filled with cars waiting to be sold. We started speaking with these businesses and realized that keeping all those cars sitting around is really, really expensive. Compounding this problem is the fact that new cars sales are falling and dealership inventory levels are historically high.<p>In response to the issues that dealerships face and the slate of bad rental options, we built a platform on which dealers can list their cars to be rented. It&#x27;s good for dealers because they can offset financing costs and depreciation of idle inventory without much effort. For renters, it means a short-term rental option that’s on average 30% cheaper any other comparable option, offers a wider selection of cars, and allows for human-free pickup and drop off.<p>It works as follows. First, browse our site for a car. Once you make a reservation, we&#x27;ll email you an Uber voucher for $20 off your trip to and from the vehicle pickup location (a 24-hour valet lot in the city). When you arrive at the pickup location, show the attendant your reservation email and they&#x27;ll fetch you your car. Once you’re done with the car, drive back to lot and hand the keys to the attendant. Use the Uber voucher to call a car to bring you back home.<p>At the moment, we&#x27;re only operating in San Francisco, but we&#x27;ll be expanding soon to Oakland and LA. If you&#x27;re in SF, try us out and use the promo code HN10 to get 10% off of any rental!<p>We’d love to get some feedback and are happy to answer questions!","time":1572278728,"title":"Launch HN: Carve (YC S19) – Rent Cars from Local Dealerships","type":"story"},{"by":"nikbackm","descendants":54,"id":21378319,"kids":[21378738,21378519,21378686,21379127,21380541,21378545,21378651,21379518,21379836,21380252,21378513,21379119,21380007],"score":192,"time":1572279655,"title":"SQLite is easy to compile","type":"story","url":"https://jvns.ca/blog/2019/10/28/sqlite-is-really-easy-to-compile/"},{"by":"anishdhar","descendants":5,"id":21378148,"kids":[21378159,21380295,21383105,21383212],"score":20,"time":1572278655,"title":"Show HN: Cortex – Living Documentation for your Microservice Architecture","type":"story","url":"https://getcortexapp.com/"},{"by":"Doubleguitars","descendants":225,"id":21377892,"kids":[21379977,21379747,21380429,21378844,21383117,21380634,21380449,21381203,21379007,21379300,21382063,21381299,21382885,21383619,21381587,21382794,21383333,21378586,21382405,21384728,21378914,21380282,21388788,21382928,21379983,21378368,21381145,21384509,21381866,21379299,21379484,21378526,21378845,21379041,21380726,21379527,21379789,21379634,21378426],"score":377,"time":1572277058,"title":"Tether: The Story So Far","type":"story","url":"https://www.kalzumeus.com/2019/10/28/tether-and-bitfinex/"},{"by":"colinprince","descendants":59,"id":21377886,"kids":[21381749,21380169,21382263,21383539,21380938,21383549,21381658,21381612,21381470,21385922,21382055,21383006,21385401,21383071,21385472,21380593],"score":216,"time":1572277032,"title":"Sourcehut Q3 2019 Financial Report","type":"story","url":"https://sourcehut.org/blog/2019-10-21-sourcehut-q3-2019-financial-report/"},{"by":"sir_pepe","descendants":2,"id":21377858,"kids":[21378079,21377896],"score":2,"time":1572276870,"title":"Reducing Redux Boilerplate in TypeScript","type":"story","url":"https://warhol.io/blog/reducing-redux-boilerplate-in-typescript"},{"by":"jaytaylor","descendants":2,"id":21377846,"kids":[21378006,21378290],"score":57,"time":1572276779,"title":"Secret Air Force Space Plane Lands After More Than 2 Years in Orbit","type":"story","url":"https://www.npr.org/2019/10/28/774010986/secret-air-force-space-plane-lands-after-more-than-2-years-in-orbit"},{"by":"susam","descendants":27,"id":21377832,"kids":[21379105,21379362,21381418,21380379,21381347,21381297,21380502,21378565,21383131,21379535,21379864],"score":58,"time":1572276691,"title":"Logo 15-word challenge (1997)","type":"story","url":"http://www.mathcats.com/gallery/15wordcontest.html"},{"by":"jajag","descendants":26,"id":21377764,"kids":[21378946,21378307,21378135,21378200,21378753,21378040,21378893,21379839],"score":44,"time":1572276224,"title":"The WeWork debacle should be an indictment of modern finance","type":"story","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/28/wework-finance-workspace-unicorn-economic-model"},{"by":"KenanSulayman","descendants":36,"id":21377769,"kids":[21378144,21378628,21378025,21379823,21381017,21379611,21378281,21377997,21378537,21382919,21378790],"score":146,"time":1572276276,"title":"Could a Neuroscientist Understand a Microprocessor?

It&#x27;s no secret that many consumers consider their devices as part of their fashion statement.<p>* Cost? Open source hardware is typically quite a bit more expensive, probably owing to lower numbers of runs and less automation?<p>* Capability? Maybe closed-sourced solutions are more polished out-of-the-box?<p>* After market support? Perhaps people feel left in the dark once they get their product without some dedicated support team? I guess your average consumer may not be happy about submitting a correctly formatted ticket to some Git interface for example.<p>* Availability?

Home (All Tasks)<p>2. My Tasks (Only those tasks which are assigned to me )<p>3. Today (Tasks which needs to be completed today only)<p>4. Next7Days (Tasks which needs to be completed in next 7 days)<p>Further to make things more user-friendly to each user we have divided each of these pages into 3 seperate views ( List, Board, Timeline ).<p>It has many more other features that I haven&#x27;t mentioned above like communication, Activities,  web push functionality so that one can get all updates without even opening an email or website.<p>We have also worked on pricing and decided to offer flat pricing like basecamp but much more affordable.<p>We are super excited to launch ourselves on HN and also, eager to get your feedback on the Due.work: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;due.work&#x2F;get-started&#x2F;","time":1571958977,"title":"Show HN: Due.work – Simplify your work, to-do's and communications","type":"story"},{"by":"welcher","descendants":2,"id":21350212,"kids":[21350377,21350308],"score":1,"text":"I&#x27;m working on an idea that involves friction points with zoning laws.

This happens because customers from different industries and company sizes are looking for different things when they land on a website and are motivated by different social proof.<p>Mutiny enables B2B companies to dynamically customize the website’s message, images, and call-to-action to match the visitor. For example, one of our customers Amplitude, a product analytics company, changes its website’s customer logos on their pricing page and signup form to match the visitor’s industry. This specific personalization generates 54% more leads. Another customer Carta, an equity management product, changes their homepage headline and messaging to highlight product features that matter most based on the visitor’s company size. They have seen 80% more leads in their smaller customer segments as a result.<p>Mutiny was inspired by our own experience. Nikhil and I were early Gusto employees and helped grow the company from 500 to 50,000 customers such as startups, restaurants and accounting firms. I led marketing and quickly learned that the same message did not work for all the businesses we served, resulting in low conversion rates. This problem got worse as we started to spend more on advertising&#x2F;content and attracting customers who had never heard of us before. Personalizing the buyer experience helped increase conversion rates, but doing it well required a lot of expertise and engineering work. And after speaking with other marketers and  growth teams we realized that virtually every B2B company serves multiple audiences with different needs, but doesn&#x27;t have sufficient engineering support to personalize their experience.<p>Here’s how it works:<p>Set up: User adds the Mutiny javascript to their website and defines their website conversion events in the Mutiny UI.<p>1. Understand visitors: We have pre-built data integrations (e.g. Clearbit, Segment, Salesforce, UTM) to identify visitors by their industry, company size, funnel stage, advertising campaign, free user v&#x2F;s paid user and more. We also display how many visitors fall into each segment and what their conversion is.<p>2. Prioritize the highest impact segments: Mutiny analyzes visitor traffic, conversion &amp; CRM data to recommend the best audience segments for personalization. It then suggests personalization playbooks that fit with the recommended segment &amp; walks the user through best practices for personalizing each segment’s experience.<p>3. Personalize any website element: Users can load any page on their website inside Mutiny’s visual editor, and change any html element such as text, image or call-to-action for that segment.<p>4. Measure results: Every Mutiny experience has an automatic control group that never sees personalization, allowing users to measure the impact of personalized experiences compared to non-personalized.<p>Mutiny is being used by Brex, Segment, Elastic, Amplitude, Carta &amp; others who are seeing 40-200% more leads with Mutiny. Our detailed case studies including screenshots of personalized web pages are available here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mutinyhq.com&#x2F;cases&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mutinyhq.com&#x2F;cases&#x2F;</a><p>We have released 30+ personalization playbooks that we have seen work well across b2b companies here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mutinyhq.com&#x2F;playbooks\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mutinyhq.com&#x2F;playbooks</a>.

This is achieved by listening for DOM events on the driver&#x27;s page and relaying them to the mirror as display instructions (e.g. add&#x2F;remove a node, change attribute, scroll page, etc.). While the mirrored page gets the DOM structure directly from their peer via a WebRTC connection, the bulk of the resources and visible content (e.g. images, fonts, stylesheets, etc.) are downloaded directly from the site being browsed.<p>There are two significant advantages of this technology:\n  1) Because each peer is rendering the same DOM with all images downloaded from the same source, they see identical, full-resolution displays of the same web page. In contrast, screencasting over limited bandwidth connections often appears as jerky, low-resolution representations.\n  2) As the peer-to-peer messages sent to maintain page sync tend to be small, the application does not require significant upload bandwidth and can be more performant for users with slower internet connections.<p>To check it out, you will need to create an account, link up with another user, and install the extension.

But I&#x27;m a bit scared I&#x27;ll be stuck in this role for a long time and later will be too rusty to &quot;jump ship&quot;.<p>I want to learn new (technical) skills that are not currently part of my skill set. Such as Python &#x2F; Flask &#x2F; Django; perhaps some Node.js (since this is where the market I work in is headed) and React or even C#. Less popular languages look interesting (Haskell, Rust, etc), but as a freelancer with family including 2 small kids, I can&#x27;t really find the business ROI on those languages since the freelance market is still too small.<p>But I am expected to jump into a project as an expert. I can do some tiny projects with new languages, but I can&#x27;t bridge that part going from &#x27;small hobby projects&#x27; to &#x27;expert&#x27;.<p>Have you had successful expansions of your skill set? Or maybe transitioned into a different domain or programming language?<p>I&#x27;ve even considered becoming employed for a year or two, using a different programming language, visiting workshops, before going back to freelancing with a larger skill set.","time":1571691465,"title":"Ask HN: How to learn new technical skills as a freelancer?","type":"story"},{"by":"rblion","descendants":61,"id":21317269,"kids":[21317512,21317522,21317478,21317469,21317492,21317656,21317552,21323906,21318397,21317504,21317707,21321083,21317711,21318537],"score":50,"time":1571691470,"title":"University dumps professor who found polar bears thriving despite climate change","type":"story","url":"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/oct/20/susan-crockford-fired-after-finding-polar-bears-th/"},{"by":"sogen","descendants":1,"id":21317160,"kids":[21317228,21317373],"score":44,"time":1571690862,"title":"Equifax Used 'Admin' as Username and Password for Sensitive Data: Lawsuit","type":"story","url":"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/19/10/21/168232/equifax-used-admin-as-username-and-password-for-sensitive-data-lawsuit"},{"by":"ycjim","descendants":3,"id":21317348,"kids":[21317509,21317909,21317417],"score":3,"text":"Altman is holding a fundraiser for Presidential candidate Andrew Yang on Wed November 13, 2019 12-2pm at his house.<p>It&#x27;s not cheap though at $2k a pop.

Note that while the questions are somewhat targeted at US-based employees because that’s what I’m most familiar with, this information should be equally valuable for other locations and I encourage those working elsewhere to fill out the form and suggest changes&#x2F;questions that would make this information more relevant for you.<p>The responses to this form are available at the second link, and please feel free to comment with suggestions of other questions to add!<p>Survey:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;forms.gle&#x2F;imnTvSV35UjY5EC28<p>Results:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2F;d&#x2F;1ZX_bcVE9bbuFbz20N4fMbFYVgltxsVeFpQ7gXlJpBrI&#x2F;edit?usp=sharing","time":1571676005,"title":"Ask HN: How much do you make at a startup?","type":"story"},{"by":"sogen","descendants":301,"id":21313816,"kids":[21314531,21317118,21315546,21314682,21317684,21316214,21315517,21315477,21315141,21316128,21314771,21315557,21314385,21316927,21316503,21314788,21315661,21314327,21317309,21314392,21317142,21320429,21314828,21314822,21315889,21316035,21318072,21315492,21319986,21316590,21319983,21314664,21314707,21316225,21317391,21320364,21317056,21321468,21315694,21315919,21317440,21319424,21315446,21315010,21319492,21315613,21314949,21316051,21315118,21316080,21314346,21315265,21319129,21318839,21315204,21314852,21318834,21319394,21314508,21316082],"score":480,"time":1571673796,"title":"Bank of America's CEO says it's saved $2B per year by building its own cloud","type":"story","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/bank-of-americas-350-million-internal-cloud-bet-striking-payoff-2019-10"},{"by":"wolco","descendants":7,"id":21314303,"kids":[21314455,21318727,21314611,21316277,21314524,21314448],"score":4,"text":"What drugs&#x2F;substance do you use to help you develop?","time":1571676019,"title":"Ask HN: What drugs do you use to help you program?","type":"story"},{"by":"aks579","descendants":13,"id":21313743,"kids":[21319721,21316378,21317375,21316767,21317901,21318584,21315756],"score":16,"time":1571673484,"title":"Show HN: Dissoc, a simple Reddit like site without voting system","type":"story","url":"http://dissoc.xyz"},{"by":"theNJR","descendants":90,"id":21313620,"kids":[21315142,21315103,21314629,21315120,21318603,21318938,21316180,21320122,21319989,21315030,21316947,21318837,21314851,21329645,21315378],"score":182,"time":1571672946,"title":"The Internet and the Third Estate","type":"story","url":"https://stratechery.com/2019/the-internet-and-the-third-estate/"},{"by":"lnguyen","descendants":50,"id":21313540,"kids":[21317241,21315836,21317993,21317301,21316950,21315984,21317670,21318490,21318560,21318714,21318163,21316199,21322727,21315864,21316708],"score":61,"time":1571672491,"title":"At an Outback Steakhouse Franchise, Surveillance Blooms","type":"story","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/outback-steakhouse-presto-vision-surveillance/"},{"by":"sateesh","descendants":5,"id":21313493,"kids":[21318705,21318980,21320136],"score":34,"time":1571672257,"title":"Portrait of an Inessential Government Worker","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-10-15/lifesaving-coast-guard-scientist-reflects-on-government-service"},{"by":"kbumsik","descendants":126,"id":21313225,"kids":[21313878,21313585,21314604,21313805,21314099,21314301,21314491,21314085,21315741,21315523,21318591,21315117,21314426,21314646,21313859],"score":105,"time":1571670916,"title":"Why Did ArchLinux Embrace Systemd?

I seem to have it in periodic bouts of time, however with little rhyme or reason. Some things like weather, dairy intake, potentially cats, even absolutely nothing at times causes me to have a ton of mucus production. Essentially hit or miss. The only thing that’s helped is Flonase, which gives me periodic skin rashes on my chest and random fevers which stop as soon as I stop taking it (under the advice from a doctor). Mucinex helps, but it’s only as good as its effects last. I’m seeing an ENT this upcoming week and I’d rather have a more effective treatment. It’s driving my husband and I nuts.

Vigorous aerobic exercise 3-4 times a week - moderately effective, not super effective<p>4. Meditation every morning - recent habit, seems to be helping but it&#x27;s too early to say<p>5. Cutting down sugar - somewhat effective when I  stick to it, often undisciplined<p>6. Cutting down carbs - same as above<p>7. SSRIs - haven&#x27;t used for 5 years, don&#x27;t think they were really working when I did<p>8. Skipping breakfast - recent habit, seems to help, too early to tell<p>9. Psychodynamic therapy - for 2 years, never seemed to help in the moment, but maybe did over the time period<p>10. Microdosing psilocybin - reasonably helpful but can&#x27;t do it every day<p>11. Modafinil - reasonably effective while on it, but it fucks with sleep; ceased use<p>Here&#x27;s what I haven&#x27;t tried that could be helpful:<p>1. CBT<p>2. Mediterranean diet<p>3. Moving to a warm country (not possible right now)<p>4. Sleeping for longer (&gt; 9 hours)<p>5. Other antidepressants<p>6. Keto diet<p>7. Weightlifting &#x2F; anaerobic exercise<p>8. Other supplements<p>9. Other types of therapy<p>10. Longer term meditation habit<p>11. Philosophy &#x2F; self-reflection<p>Has anyone tried something from the second list that was particularly helpful? Anyone figured out a way to overcome this (or just depression&#x2F;cognitive decline in general)?","time":1571528319,"title":"Ask HN: How to deal with seasonal affective disorder?","type":"story"},{"by":"dredmorbius","descendants":60,"id":21301374,"kids":[21302590,21302381,21305007,21303821,21301807],"score":55,"time":1571528172,"title":"Climate and Unsheltered Homeless in the Continental United States","type":"story","url":"https://streetlifesolutions.blogspot.com/2019/10/climate-and-unsheltered-homeless-in.html"},{"by":"jp57","descendants":2,"id":21301452,"kids":[21308352,21302098],"score":2,"time":1571529432,"title":"Is Whilst the Handlebar Mustache of Modern English? – JP Fosterson","type":"story","url":"http://jp-fosterson.com/writing/2019/10/19/whilst.html"},{"by":"swidi","descendants":13,"id":21301323,"kids":[21301337,21306694,21321340,21302040,21301417,21302054,21302685,21301399,21301353,21303112],"score":7,"text":"As a Python programmer, I heartily subscribe to the philosophy of &quot;we&#x27;re all consenting adults here&quot; [0].

We&#x27;re helping them store it, spend it and earn interest.<p>We have been in this industry for the past 3 years. Thibaut used to lead sales at Stratumn, a Nasdaq-backed company helping companies securing their shared workflows through cryptocurrencies. Théo built several decentralized applications before starting the company in 2018.<p>Wallets are the cornerstone of the industry: you need them to store and transact with cryptocurrencies. But these wallets are not designed for business. You cannot perform simple business operations like running a payroll, paying vendors, or earning interest, which you can currently do from your modern business bank account.<p>Cryptocurrencies - and particularly stablecoins - are a reliable, fast and cost-efficient medium of exchange. It’s a technology that enables anyone to move value and assets across borders, with no intermediaries. We believe it can help companies save a lot, since most of them are now actively transacting with partners abroad, from suppliers to foreign contractors.<p>The number of companies building and transacting with cryptocurrencies is growing (e.g. Stateofthedapp listings grew by 250% since 2017), despite still being in its infancy. Most of these companies are operating in the cryptocurrency industry, or are e-merchants willing to reduce payment fees and optimize working capital.<p>These companies struggle to manage their assets and make the most of them. They typically have between 5 and 10 wallets, none of them being designed for a business environment. This makes business spending and accounting still to painful and time-consuming. And cryptocurrencies sit idle, because there are just too many frictions.<p>We realized what was really needed: an application to manage cryptocurrency the same as a modern online business bank account, with features and financial services powered by both crypto and traditional currencies. In short, a crypto-first bank. Here are our main features today:<p>- Store - multi-user wallet with dashboard and transaction history<p>- Pay - spending policies and streamlined payment flows (1)<p>- Exchange - swap 70+ tokens with ethers, dollars and euros (2)<p>- Earn - savings account yielding interest on stablecoins (3)<p>- Soon: EUR and USD bank accounts<p>We will make revenues through commissions on financial services like fiat ramps, and through monthly subscriptions for premium features like accounting exports or fiat accounts.<p>Our goal of making a unified front end that works like a business bank account is challenging to achieve because the technologies we&#x27;re using are very heterogenous:<p>- we have two databases: the Ethereum blockchain and Cloud Firestore<p>- we have two backends: smart contracts and Firebase Cloud functions<p>- we have two authentication systems: private keys stored on individual wallets (we&#x27;re self-custodian) and email addresses<p>- we have two authorization systems: the multisignature contract owners and the owner&#x2F;guest roles in our security rules<p>- we have two type of assets: cryptogoods and traditional currencies<p>- we will have two storages: IPFS and Firebase Storage<p>You can read more here about our architecture (4) and our approach to security (5).<p>Cryptocurrency is still a recent technology that generates understandable skepticism.The ICO craze did not help. We feel that payment is becoming a tangible use case though, and companies ranging from Facebook to JP Morgan are now actively investing in it. We believe more will join. There are still many uncertainties about regulations, accounting, and each new SEC or FinCEN guidance make the teams&#x27; hair turn grey. But things are moving forward on the ground, despite the excess of hype in the space.<p>We want to make Multis useful, so we have one question: what would be the key features and financial services you would expect as a company? They don&#x27;t have to be related to crypto directly. We&#x27;d also love your feedback, your questions and your ideas.

The association is voluntary, with minimal dues income at $10 &#x2F; household. Our dues are mainly allocated to put on a yearly neighborhood picnic and to pay for expenses related to the larger advocacy that the association board and members participate in. Our neighborhood is bordered by several &quot;historic designation&quot; neighborhoods, which makes ours a target for developers looking to churn maximum profit per acre. Most of our advocacy and work goes towards keeping the neighborhood an actual neighborhood, pedestrian and bike friendly, keeping green spaces green, and welcoming to families both new and legacy. It&#x27;s a non-intrusive, well-intentioned group of people mostly on their own dime and time.<p>We&#x27;ve gone through the arduous review and appeal process with both Microsoft and Google but was ultimately denied the free to use, nonprofit account, as we&#x27;re a Florida State-registered and validated nonprofit, and not 501(c)(3) federally registered. We&#x27;ve explored the paid route, but would cost the dues of 36 households, when only 22 participate presently. We can&#x27;t get corporate sponsors as we haven&#x27;t found any willing to donate with no federal write-off. We can&#x27;t register as a 501(c)(3) because the registration process and yearly requirements are cost-prohibitive. We can&#x27;t get grants to pay for registration because we have to be registered to apply. It&#x27;s a tough chicken and egg situation.<p>What we&#x27;re in need of:\n- An [email] account for 5 board officers\n- Collaborative cloud storage\n- Groups &#x2F; Forums that residents can subscribe to\n- Email lists<p>I&#x27;ve so far been unable to find services that will cater to state-registered, but not federally registered (501(c)(3)), nonprofits for these needs.

HN, Matt from Hawkeye Labs (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;usehawkeye.com) here!<p>Everyone knows understanding user behavior is essential to improving products. As recent success stories like Superhuman and Notion have shown, good design is everywhere these days. This means it’s more important than ever to get actionable insights into how people use your products.<p>However, existing research tools could be a lot better. One option is event-based analytics and always-on screen recorders, but these services only show you which pages the user visits and what actions they perform. Another approach is conducting narrated studies with paid participants. These sessions give you a huge amount of information, but can become boring to watch and often aren’t representative of real users.<p>Hawkeye takes a different approach to user research. Using the TrueDepth camera on iOS devices, Hawkeye lets you track where people look in your products without the need for any extra hardware. This gives you a far better understanding of the user’s thought process than traditional screen recordings. You can see where they get confused, what grabs their attention, and begin to understand why they perform the actions they do.<p>Today, we’re excited to launch the Hawkeye testing platform. Right off the bat, you can test any mobile website or InVision prototype, with more test types coming soon. The platform lets you invite participants to complete tests on their own devices and makes it easy to play back screen recordings and view heatmaps from your product.<p>This is just the start of what we have planned.

morning everyone,\nI Have had an Idea That I think has never been implemented by governments to fight cash evasion\nI&#x27;m from Italy and here is a quite big problem [1]<p>This idea also allow to

expiration&#x2F;validation system on cash bills (maybe only those bigger than 1€ )<p>:: HOW TO DO IT ::<p>1) - obviously it would not be convenient to throw away the banknotes so the banknotes are &quot;revalidated&quot; in a database of the state that contains the banknote number and the expiry date.<p>2) - to revalidate the cash just &quot;photograph&quot; ( maybe in future if this works the bills may have a qr code for a better digitalization ) it with an app for smartphones or specially created tools that follow the same principle of scanning and sending that can also be integrated into special counterfeit banknote detectors or go to the bank with banknotes every MAX 2 years for perform the operation at the counter<p>3) - the payment operators can equip themselves with a machine that validates the cash (which will probably be like a counterfeit money detector but which moreover read the serial number and validate it (send it to the ministerial database)<p>4) - expired cash is no longer valid, it can be re-enabled only at a bank by presenting identity documents of those who deposit (or could be worth 40% less than the nominal value creating a kind of &quot;forced tax on the black&quot; ( or read *6 )<p>5) - during validation (through specific machinery &#x2F; mobile app &#x2F; bank counter) the cash is tracked and associated with the validating entity (in this way an operator &#x2F; private individual will not validate cash for third parties without then declaring it in the balance sheet)<p>6) .. \n( not enough chars, see my comment here below or full :

advice from anyone who&#x27;s beyond this stage and found a &quot;solution. &quot;<p>The following realizations have placed me in an emotional spiral.<p>1. My job is not a good fit for me. Been working here as a software engineer for 3 years and 90% of the time, I&#x27;m bored and uninspired. Part of the reason is that I prefer coding stuff for people and not for businesses. I think that if I start working for non-profits or B2C companies it might solve this issue.<p>2. I love making an impact and helping others, and I&#x27;m not doing that in any capacity. Again, my job involves business software, completely boring to me. And volunteering opportunities in my areas of interests (voter rights, race relations, modernization of civic government technology) seem more challenging to come by.<p>3. I don&#x27;t understand passions. For awhile, I&#x27;ve been running a blog simply cause it got me extra money but not because I actually liked it. I recently decided to finally stop it and haven&#x27;t found anything to fill the void. I got sucked into all the entrepreneur porn and turned every hobby and side project into something that&#x27;ll make money. Well now all of that has back fired cause I&#x27;m left with nothing I truly want to do. Even thinking of doing a side project will leave me uncomfortable if I&#x27;m not monetizing it.<p>4. I just want to relax. I&#x27;m jealous of those people who are perfectly content with the daily routine of life. Why do I feel like I need to change something? Do something big? Build something to change society? Why can&#x27;t I just live the typical life and accept that as success?","time":1571142214,"title":"Ask HN: I'm 23 and already feeling stuck in life","type":"story"},{"by":"phacks","descendants":288,"id":21257661,"kids":[21259267,21260517,21259072,21259247,21262029,21259427,21259091,21265744,21259055,21260337,21259203,21259842,21262380,21262153,21263674,21262289,21261558,21259238,21261733,21261789,21259639,21266821,21267918,21262035,21260229,21263007,21266536,21267410,21260291,21280321,21266422,21267600,21279052,21264766,21259768,21267171,21261631,21266436,21262699,21260510,21260818,21261305,21266060,21262399,21271619,21261679,21265653,21270608,21263855,21265323,21261266,21283198,21262374,21264195,21262923,21260701,21265073,21259242,21285301,21260716,21264582,21265341,21261478,21263401,21264961,21262484,21262253,21268821,21261147,21262433,21264739,21261192,21260043,21271431,21262366,21262921,21259582,21261353,21265424,21264474,21263623,21263169,21261930],"score":722,"time":1571142253,"title":"Meetup.com alternatives","type":"story","url":"https://phacks.dev/meetup-com-alternatives"},{"by":"DanBC","descendants":11,"id":21257656,"kids":[21258249,21258226,21258533,21257721,21257970],"score":37,"time":1571142168,"title":"Britains ancient yews – mystical, magnificent, and unprotected","type":"story","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/28/britain-ancient-yews-mystical-magnificent-and-unprotected"},{"by":"wonder_er","descendants":13,"id":21257668,"kids":[21258352,21258287,21258415,21258560,21258321],"score":72,"time":1571142286,"title":"CBP Agent Rams Vehicle into Videographer","type":"story","url":"https://www.roadblockrevelations.org/wp/2019/10/13/cbp-agent-rams-vehicle-into-videographer/"},{"by":"sfg75","descendants":106,"id":21257529,"kids":[21276910,21277907,21276509,21276881,21278541,21281124,21276729,21277993,21277279,21276931,21278927,21279450,21277365,21279636,21280615,21278008,21279729,21279336,21279806,21281218,21277406],"score":318,"time":1571140337,"title":"Algolia raises $110M for its search-as-a-service","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/15/algolia-finds-110m-from-accel-and-salesforce-for-its-search-as-a-service-used-by-slack-twitch-and-8k-others/"},{"by":"vvoyer","descendants":3,"id":21257539,"kids":[21257698,21258901],"score":21,"time":1571140446,"title":"Algolia raises $110M Series C","type":"story","url":"https://blog.algolia.com/algolia-series-c-2019-funding?2"},{"by":"Schiphol","descendants":8,"id":21257348,"kids":[21284557,21285216],"score":15,"time":1571137904,"title":"Braille Music","type":"story","url":"https://www.rnib.org.uk/practical-help/reading/braille-and-moon-tactile-codes/braille-music"},{"by":"mhandley","descendants":109,"id":21257355,"kids":[21257894,21257536,21257830,21260689,21257741,21260678,21257717,21257681],"score":166,"time":1571138044,"title":"5G Mobile Networks: A Systems Approach","type":"story","url":"https://5g.systemsapproach.org/index.html"},{"by":"massacre","descendants":12,"id":21257284,"kids":[21258347,21257665,21258383,21257874],"score":87,"time":1571136997,"title":"CVE-2019-14287: Sudo Bug Allows Restricted Users to Run Commands as Root","type":"story","url":"https://sensorstechforum.com/cve-2019-14287-sudo-bug/"},{"by":"ryeguy_24","descendants":26,"id":21257276,"kids":[21258104,21259832,21293118,21257412,21262026,21258135,21257752,21258243,21257505,21267550,21258389],"score":15,"text":"So, I’m a new dad.

It seems like everything works fundamentally differently than it does for a smaller scale company.<p>Do you have any advice for short&#x2F;long term success as a developer that is very new to operating in an environment at this scale?","time":1570796025,"title":"Ask HN: How to succeed as an IC at a larger company","type":"story"},{"by":"sohkamyung","descendants":32,"id":21223831,"kids":[21224313,21224322,21224301,21225430,21226072,21224860,21224042,21224872,21226384,21224891,21230493,21224250,21224167,21224887],"score":292,"time":1570798320,"title":"Alexei Leonov, the first human to walk in space, has died","type":"story","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alexei-leonov-died-cosmonaut-first-man-to-walk-in-space-dead-age-85-cause-of-death-not-released-2019-10-11/"},{"by":"reverseengineer","descendants":7,"id":21223377,"kids":[21224893,21224695,21225849,21230270],"score":6,"time":1570794216,"title":"Show HN: Smart American Roadtrips","type":"story","url":"https://curiosio.com?iso=us"},{"by":"eibrahim","descendants":7,"id":21223352,"kids":[21224295,21223887,21224288],"score":36,"time":1570794016,"title":"JavaScript Illustrated: Promises","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/front-end-weekly/js-illustrated-promises-c87efb8d27a9"},{"by":"raunometsa","descendants":7,"id":21223348,"kids":[21233384,21227076,21259789,21224256],"score":15,"time":1570794003,"title":"Show HN: Community for Remote Workers","type":"story","url":"https://remotehub.io/community"},{"by":"ryan_j_naughton","descendants":146,"id":21223069,"kids":[21223360,21223991,21224170,21223857,21223416,21223251,21223361,21223362,21223980,21224231,21223245,21225068,21224043,21223611,21225158,21224285,21224336,21223970,21224459],"score":111,"time":1570790134,"title":"The Navy's Patent for a Compact Nuclear Fusion Reactor","type":"story","url":"https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/energy/a29427713/navy-compact-fusion-reactor/"},{"by":"amelius","descendants":4,"id":21223207,"kids":[21223208,21226224],"score":4,"time":1570792218,"title":"‘Thermal inductor’ could convert boiling water to ice with no energy input","type":"story","url":"https://physicsworld.com/a/thermal-inductor-could-convert-boiling-water-to-ice-with-no-energy-input/"},{"by":"pseudolus","descendants":219,"id":21222991,"kids":[21223615,21224482,21223939,21223176,21224307,21223337,21223725,21223145,21224259,21223957,21226063,21224507,21229563,21223237,21225587,21228497,21225492,21225557,21229435,21227184,21226737,21227134,21223308,21228559,21225645,21227136,21228018,21229371,21224272,21225797,21223347,21225180,21223211,21223492,21223202,21223379,21227714,21223490,21224036,21223557,21223730,21224114,21224385,21223878,21224980],"score":408,"time":1570789427,"title":"Exposure to air pollution is linked to an increase in violent crime","type":"story","url":"https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/10/09/exposure-to-air-pollution-is-linked-to-an-increase-in-violent-crime"},{"by":"NN88","descendants":64,"id":21223073,"kids":[21226619,21226387,21223567,21226878,21226746,21223412,21227607,21228618,21223300,21238437,21227615,21225044,21223893,21224805],"score":122,"time":1570790152,"title":"Quintillion CEO’s Promise to Wire the Arctic Was $1B Scam","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-10-08/quintillion-ceo-s-promise-to-wire-the-arctic-was-1-billion-scam"},{"by":"homeproject_123","descendants":2,"id":21222928,"kids":[21224338,21225972],"score":13,"text":"I am interested in Program Analysis (or Static Code Analysis).

HN,<p>It&#x27;s that old question again, but this time it comes from maybe a slightly different place.<p>I&#x27;m a fairly introverted person. I&#x27;ve been a sysadmin for over 20 years, and always been happy to work from the back office up to my elbows in terminals and code. I&#x27;ve not sought out the spotlight, pushed to lead, nor tried to tell others what to do. I&#x27;ve always thought of that as something I simply couldn&#x27;t do.<p>Recently I&#x27;ve been put forward for a team lead role, managing just a handful of devops positions. I&#x27;ve been highly praised for a whole slew of stuff, and now I&#x27;m a team lead, and way way way out of my comfort zone. If I am honest with myself, I am terrified of all the things that may go wrong.<p>HN, I need your advice on how to be an introverted team lead. Those of you with a similar outlook on life, how did you cope? How did you manage all the meetings, 1 to 1s, vendor calls, and more? Were there any books that helped you, and were there any that you would avoid like the plague?<p>Any advice will be deeply appreciated.","time":1570717072,"title":"Ask HN: Advice for an introverted

Everything is urgent. Some employees use conflicts and accusations to reach their goals and get their requests prioritised. There is no planning on their side. Obsession for some features comes and goes.<p>They rarely open to advices, on one skype call after I tried to clarify what they want and raise concerns, I’ve been told “We are here not to discuss, but to inform you about our decision. We need this to be done precisely as we want.” Their request would result in a very ineffective process for them (in this particular case they would have to deal with duplicate data later). They lacked the knowledge of how their own system worked, but they neither wanted to ask nor listen to any advice.<p>Their corporate mantra can be summarized as: I know everything (even if I don&#x27;t), everyone else around me (subordinates, top managers, contractors) is an idiot.<p>I allowed them to behave like that in the beginning, I didn’t set the right boundaries because I was too interested in the project, now I have to deal with consequences.

One short answer is : donate to an organisation that purchases rainforests for conservation. David Attenborough said : &quot;...it has more effect than almost anything I can think of&quot;<p>Why? Because keeping rainforests intact not only protects the plants and animals within them but also sequesters carbon, regulates the climate and produces the air we breathe. There is no technological replacement for the multifunctional complexity of rainforests.<p>Another thing you could do is volunteer your coding skills and join our non-profit &quot;Fend&quot;. We are taking land acquisition conservation to the masses by building an interactive site where visitors can purchase half acre blocks of rainforest. For every patch they purchase, they can zoom into our front page, choose a block to turn it green, and post their action on social media. Our goal is to turn the whole front page green, which is where we can leverage media&#x2F;following interest.<p>Right now we need developers to help with all aspects of the build. Our most pressing challenge is implementation of the &quot;block picking&quot; functionality on the front page and how to load millions of blocks&#x2F;cells in the canvas while maintaining a snappy to navigate browser experience. The second challenge will be taking a custom snap shot of the page that highlights the user&#x27;s block&#x2F;s, and then making it easy for them to get their snap shot onto their social media.<p>Can you help?<p>If so get in touch : info@fend.earth<p>(Download the PDF on fend.earth for further information)","time":1570543713,"title":"Ask HN: Do You Want to Use Your Skills to Save Rainforests?","type":"story"},{"by":"louisv","descendants":33,"id":21192710,"kids":[21193561,21195634,21193521,21199102,21195012,21195507,21194273,21196835,21194355,21199415,21195353],"score":159,"time":1570545079,"title":"All paid targeting options available on social media platforms","type":"story","url":"https://www.notion.so/Targeting-Explorer-7e283ffd84d242abbbfce67476878d0f"},{"by":"eplanit","descendants":2,"id":21192383,"kids":[21193133,21192733],"score":2,"time":1570543300,"title":"A guy tweeted an ingenious hotel-room hack and Twitter responded with their own","type":"story","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/tips/guy-tweeted-an-ingenious-hotel-room-hack-twitter-responded-with-their-own/"},{"by":"kome","descendants":2,"id":21192131,"kids":[21192205,21192227],"score":2,"text":"What your best productivity killer?

At the time of writing I currently own a 2018 Golf GTI which I daily to and from work. I’ve done a few modifications to it, lowered it, tuned it and did some intake modifications - nothing crazy since it’s my daily but I noticed that researching modifications and build threads was not as easy as I would have liked. I can list maybe 2 builds that I was able to actually find a full thread for and even then they were either heavily out of date and&#x2F;or plagued by the photobucket image blurring. I thought there has to be a better way to share your vehicle&#x2F;search for other vehicles without the need to go crazy scouring google or antiquated message board pages only to find troves of posts that contain dead images.<p>Since I’m also a software engineer by trade, I came up with the idea for a more modern, vehicle-profile focused web-application for enthusiasts who want to share their vehicles stories, photos, parts and get feedback on their projects. Fast forward about four months and many lines of code later and I think I have what should be a decent representation of the idea I had in mind. The whole app is written using Go and Go templates since that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m familiar with at the moment and is deployed to Lambda using Up by Apex. As of right now, the project is far from complete but it’s called Tunerhub and you can check it out at the url below.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tunerhub.com<p>I have loads of ideas for future additions&#x2F;improvements however my question to you is - Is a platform like this something the car community wants?

Get back an enthusiastic response. A video call was scheduled that their head of engineering ghosted on. When emailed, he didn&#x27;t respond. After contacting my original contact, they apologized and we scheduled an in person interview.<p>* The in person interview went well. Talked to the whole team (including leadership) and everyone seemed excited about bringing me on. They then sent me a coding exercise to do over the weekend.<p>* I completed the coding exercise and felt I did a reasonable job on it. After sending it back to them, the head of engineering asked me how to run my code (python). After that I received no response from them. Waited a little over a week and sent a follow up to the head of engineering which didn&#x27;t receive a response. Finally emailed my original point of contact and got an email saying that they were heading in a different direction.<p>I&#x27;ve found the process frustrating.

But consider this: the base unit of code is the character. I use vim because it&#x27;s the best at manipulating characters. Your IDE (visual studio, intellij, etc.) understands your code on the AST level, but when you edit with it, you&#x27;re still editing on the character level. It still performs character-to-character transformations, even if it uses that knowledge.  Your code is still saved as a plain text file.<p>And this has caused all sorts of problems. For instance, you can make a flat text file which doesn&#x27;t map correctly onto AST; this is called a syntax error. There are disputes about how the text file should be formatted (tabs or spaces?). Parsing is slow and difficult. Sometimes you misalign something; that only occurs because tokens have no boundaries.<p>Now consider the alternative: code is stored as a binary AST. Your editor is an interface for interacting with that AST, your compiler deserialises that AST directly into memory. An entire class of problems is eliminated. Whether your editor understands your code on an AST level is no longer a question. Yet, at the same time, the barrier to entry for writing an intelligent editor is significantly lowered. Same for writing a compiler. You get a lot more choice in terms of how you want your code formatted. Want your python code with braces, or your c code without? Done. The language itself doesn&#x27;t even have braces or colons anymore. Any tool that parses code runs a lot faster. And we don&#x27;t even need a new language!

Software requirements are simple: easy enough that they can use it after I set it up, and incremental such that the computer doesn&#x27;t have to have special power-on hours for it to run a complete backup.<p>For example, telling them to copy the Documents and Pictures folders and pasting them on an external drive is a no-go, as it would take many hours every time. Telling them to copy only new files to the drive seems error-prone and annoying, and I additionally don&#x27;t think I could explain that to my grandma. Leaving the drive permanently connected isn&#x27;t really an option with laptops, and is a cryptolocker risk (I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they click on a cryptolocker sooner or later). Not to mention the risk of fire.<p>If there is good software, an external drive is a reasonable compromise and a cheap option. The software I found for local backups typically requires more than a single click, and many hard-code the drive letter (which is variable). I also found that my mom plugged in the backup drive exactly zero times over the course of half a year.<p>For online backup, I would like it to be properly encrypted (I&#x27;ll manage the key: if I get hit by a bus, they still have the original data). Trying Backblaze, the backup gets stuck on a random picture. Asking support, they say it might be a read lock, which is plausible, but c&#x27;mon, Windows and indefinite read locks exist since forever, it should not break the backup completely. I guess I&#x27;ll implement support&#x27;s solution (ask mom to reboot) and pay for a month while continuing to monitor it...<p>Cygwin and rsync (or restic or so) is possible, but requires me to run a server with ~500GB of free space.

By moderate I mean we&#x27;ve always been cash-flow positive and our gross revenue grows by a modest percentage each year. I hear that 90% of SaaS businesses fail, so I guess our &quot;not-failing&quot; could be seen as success.<p>But it&#x27;s not the &quot;success&quot; I&#x27;d hoped for. I&#x27;m in my late 30s now, but in a way, I&#x27;m still kind of subsidising the business, because my pay is probably 50% of the market rate for a developer with my experience. Obviously, we still can&#x27;t afford to hire more developers, so it&#x27;s just been me, coding away on my own, for years.<p>We have loyal customers, some who&#x27;ve been with us since the beginning. But our product is getting stale. To stay alive, we&#x27;ve added features to lure in new customers, and to keep them, we&#x27;ve made promises (I know, I know... two things you never do: allow feature-creep and promise features in the future).

We help women over 50 build their community by hosting and attending small, local gatherings.<p>We&#x27;re two women in our 30s who decided to work on this problem after seeing how important and how challenging it has been for our mothers.<p>Lisa&#x27;s mother raised her as a single parent while working as a public school teacher, and that meant that she didn&#x27;t have much time to focus on her life outside of parenting. When Lisa left for college, her mother retired, and found herself longing for a community of like-minded women, which wasn’t easy. Alexa&#x27;s mother is similar in need but different in circumstance: she&#x27;s a physician with a high-powered career and a robust social life, living in a dense urban area, who nonetheless feels that she doesn&#x27;t know where to turn for genuine connections with women her age.<p>In the United States alone, there are 50 million women like our mothers. They are a dramatically underserved demographic. We sometimes hear talk of &quot;elder tech&quot; and &quot;silver tech&quot; but our customer is not &quot;the elderly&quot;—she&#x27;s in her 50s, 60s, or 70s, statistically healthier than ever before, with some disposable income to spend, and she wants to enjoy life alongside women her own age.<p>How Revel works is that any woman over 50 can sign up to join as a member for $15 a month. As a member, she can then browse our listings of Revel events being hosted by other members in her neighborhood. All of our events are user-generated and any member can apply to host at any time.<p>We&#x27;re operating only in the Bay Area for now, but obviously our plan is to expand geographically as soon as it makes sense. Since we launched in late July, we&#x27;ve had hundreds of women sign up as members, and have had dozens of member-hosted gatherings in living rooms and backyard gardens across the Bay Area.

After getting over the initial hump of learning how lifetimes and the borrow checker work, I would say I&#x27;m just as productive in Rust as I am in Go. If anything I end up writing fewer lines of code in Rust. The tooling is excellent, and even compilation times have gotten better.<p>My main concern is how many dependencies I end up with doing simple stuff like web requests and database queries. I just finished a script that uses reqwest, rust-postgres, and serde which compiles 221 crates! Am I doing something wrong? I used all of the generally &quot;accepted&quot; dependencies recommended for those tasks and it didn&#x27;t seem like the Rust stdlib had much support for them. Contrast that with a similar app written in Go and the only dependency outside of the standard library that I needed was pq for Postgres.<p>I realize that Rust guarantees backwards compatibility for compilation, but what if I need to go back a year from now and make a bunch of changes to that script?

there,<p>I&#x27;m at the end of my MSc. studies in CS. At the moment, I can choose to graduate in a month or two, or stay-on for another 9 months doing research in interactive theorem proving that will potentially lead to a PhD opportunity.<p>I&#x27;m doing my MSc in a foreign country and I&#x27;m very unhappy here. Another ~9 months seems like a huge hurdle to me. The current situation is if I choose to graduate soon, I will likely surrender my chance for a PhD.<p>I don&#x27;t particularly <i>love</i> studying. I think interactive theorem proving is quite cool, but the actual practice of studying&#x2F;research hasn&#x27;t been that enjoyable to me, but I enjoy having the knowledge once I&#x27;ve acquired it. In many ways it seems like &quot;the future&quot; to me, and it&#x27;d be really neat to be one of the first passengers on that train, so to say.<p>I have no desire to become a professor&#x2F;researcher. After I acquire my PhD, I surmise that I would go to industry.<p>The issue here is one of bad information: I don&#x27;t have industry experience and I don&#x27;t really know how any of this stuff plays out. I&#x27;m worried that if I chose to forego the PhD, I&#x27;ll really regret it in a number of years. I&#x27;m afraid I won&#x27;t be able to find interesting work with just a MSc, and I&#x27;m really afraid of getting a boring software engineering gig.<p>I&#x27;m concerned that without the expertise&#x2F;knowledge&#x2F;academic maturity that I would gain from a PhD, I&#x27;ll be stuck doing things that bore me after a number of years, with no room to grow to more interesting things. Equally concerning to me is that I think I&#x27;d likely be miserable during the PhD process. It seems very lonely, and I don&#x27;t find much enjoyment from, say, sitting in my office reading papers all day. I much prefer creating things. I also think I&#x27;m just not that bright and that a PhD would be a huge intellectual challenge for me.

Cashflow is a single connection point for neobanks, payment services, and digital wallets, making it easy to send money between different platforms.<p>We started building Cashflow only a few weeks ago as part of the Antler startup generator in Stockholm. We have 10 years of experience building fintech products, but it was the Antler program itself that inspired our project. We saw that people from across the world had no great, effortless way of sending money to each other.<p>The fintech market in Europe is becoming fragmented. Lots of interesting services are popping up, but if you move countries a lot, you still have to fall back to old methods for money transfers.<p>To be fair, we are not the first to make cross-border transfers more accessible — PayPal and TransferWise are great examples of progress made in this industry. But what no one has done so far is making cross-border transfers as uncomplicated as domestic transfers.<p>The products in this space still treat transfers as chores, but our observation is that the way people want to transfer money has changed. It has become a much more playful and frequent activity.<p>The fragmentation and accessibility are two sides of the same coin, and we aim to solve both. Cashflow connects different fintech services, so you don&#x27;t have to think about what platform people are using. Similarly, we want people to be able to settle debts on a daily basis, without worrying about fees and slow processing.<p>Cashflow works by using a combination of current banking infrastructure, the new payment directives (PSD2, etc.), and a handcrafted approach where we hold funds in different places.<p>Today, we’re taking our first baby steps; applying the age-old wisdom of releasing something small early. We are eager to hear about your experiences in this area, and what unmet needs you may have.

It seems it&#x27;ll be easier to save money in Berlin to work towards financial independence.<p>On the other hand, tech companies in Canada pay peanuts and the high cost of living leaves quite a small amount to save each month. However, once a Canadian citizen, there is a possiblity to get transferred to a Silicon Valley arm of a US company from Canada (using the TN visa) and hence receive a higher compensation.<p>How would you compare between the two countries for building a career in tech for an immigrant?","time":1569760481,"title":"Ask HN: Germany vs. Canada for Tech Jobs?","type":"story"},{"by":"cc-d","descendants":164,"id":21106611,"kids":[21111481,21110903,21114301,21110598,21112740,21110881,21111678,21110945,21110995,21110525,21110902,21110234,21110977,21110458,21110926,21110950,21113333,21115160,21113869,21110755,21113300,21113374,21113337,21110854,21112254,21111085,21112365,21111866,21110264,21112437,21110534,21111074,21110887,21111652,21114345,21110789,21111643,21110480,21111720,21110393,21110885,21117237,21117575,21110411,21110522,21110541],"score":220,"time":1569759553,"title":"Show HN: Ieddit – A minimalist, Reddit-like site with anonymous posts/comments","type":"story","url":"https://ieddit.com/about/"},{"by":"vinnyglennon","descendants":20,"id":21106628,"kids":[21107695,21108056,21107621,21108119,21110212,21109257,21107867,21108205],"score":64,"time":1569759864,"title":"Simple Is Complex","type":"story","url":"https://avdi.codes/simple-is-complex/"},{"by":"amelius","descendants":63,"id":21106607,"kids":[21107084,21106845,21106725,21106866,21106790,21108343,21106887,21106675],"score":62,"time":1569759536,"title":"How Much Air Pollution Is Produced by Rockets?

In many Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, this stock makes up 10-30% of the available housing (in South Bend, IN where we live, the median house value is $78k).  But these houses are still inaccessible for a lot of working families who want to be home owners - instead, they typically end up renting the same housing and miss out on the primary way Americans build wealth.<p>what’s stopping people from buying these houses?<p>Banks aren’t interested in making mortgages below $80k due to their profit structure.  When a bank makes a mortgage, the majority of its revenue comes from the fees it charges to originate, typically a percentage of the total loan value.  But since many mortgages are sold to the secondary market (Fannie and Freddie), it costs the bank the same amount to make a $50k loan as it does a $500k loan.  If they are servicing the loan for Fannie or Freddie they’ll earn a fraction of the interest, but how much money that equates to still depends on the size of the loan while again having fixed costs.  So if it costs a bank at least $800 to make a mortgage, they’ll lose money on every loan they make worth less than $80k - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;small-mortgages-are-getting-harder-to-come-by-11557394201<p>This is the problem we&#x27;re solving with Hurry Home.<p>We work with individuals looking to make investments for passive cash flow while still making an impact on people’s lives.

Canadian startup for just under 3 years. I signed a stock option agreement at the very beginning of 2017.<p>My understanding of private equity was:\nOver a scheduled period of time, options would be granted to me. These are shares in the company that can be purchased at my given strike price.<p>So a smart person would do either two things with their vested options:\n1. Purchase them, and then immediately sell them back if there is a positive spread.\n2. Ignore them because the spread is negative, making the options essentially worthless (unless you want to hold onto the shares for a year or more and hope the company goes back up in value. I&#x27;m taught that this is generally an awful idea.)<p>I&#x27;m hinting at some incomplete knowledge here because unlike a publicly traded company on a stock market, I&#x27;m not sure who would be purchasing the shares from me. I figure it would be either the startup themselves or the investors involved with the startup.<p>This is the curve ball:\n[When asking what the current value of a share is, in order to determine the spread] &quot;it was just re-evaluated to that new strike price. You don&#x27;t know the value until it goes public. It is a much better value now than it was previously so you are in a better position.&quot;<p>Current value re-evaluated to a strike price? This is a puzzling statement to me, but more importantly, I&#x27;m not allowed to know the value until the company goes public?? I find that to be very suspicious. I&#x27;m supposed to take my employer&#x27;s word that the spread exists? But I&#x27;m not allowed to know what it is?<p>My instincts are raising red flags.

We provide audio versions of articles. Instead of sitting in front of your computer reading your favourite blogs or news articles, you can listen to them while you commute, run or cook.<p>While being in YC over the last three months, we’ve developed both the iOS and Android apps. You can find these here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;listle.app.link&#x2F;m2DbuzvEDZ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;listle.app.link&#x2F;m2DbuzvEDZ</a>.<p>We started this out while still being in university, back in London, a few months ago. The idea was born as a solution to the painful process of using crappy text-to-speech software to listen to articles on the commute to lectures. We used Instapaper, Pocket and open source solutions for text to speech, but none were great. We noticed that as much as technology has evolved, listening to a robotic voice for more than five minutes is still simply terrible.<p>The success of podcasts and audiobooks shows that people enjoy listening to content. However, most of the content out there is still in written format. Listle aims to bridge the gap between these two worlds and enable people to listen to any article on the Internet. For example, you can listen to Paul Graham’s, Michael Seibel’s and several other YC partners’ articles. We’re also actively partnering with independent authors and enabling them to distribute their content in audio, through an embedded player on their Medium page &#x2F; personal blog.

Here is the hypothesis&#x2F;pain point:<p>ML and more broadly data science are very useful, but even some of the most recent &quot;easy&quot; data science tools (e.g. Google AutoML tables) have too high of a learning curve to be useful to the average consumer.<p>Normally if you were learning a new tool, you might learn through a combination of study, and trial and error. However, many people don&#x27;t have a lot of time to sit down and learn something complex in this manner. (They need a bit of an extra push to minimize their error&#x2F;guide them toward reasonable use cases.) The result is something like this:<p>1 - get excited to try something easy and get new value out of their data<p>2 - get frustrated because the tool is not easy enough, or they don&#x27;t know what questions are answerable with the available algorithms<p>3 - search the internet for guidance on what the algorithms do, get overwhelmed<p>4 - abandon tool<p>Solution:<p>1 - send us your data (probably a spreadsheet&#x2F;CSV&#x2F;Excel file)<p>2 - we analyze the data, and send you a list of questions that we can answer&#x2F;insights that we can derive<p>3 - you select which of the questions you want answered<p>4 - we run our analyses and send you the results, including an explanation of the algorithms that were used to derive the results<p>The key here is that the &quot;learning&quot; takes place after value is delivered to the user. Even though a tool may allow you to do things with the click of a button, the hidden complexity still presents a learning curve to the user.<p>Footnotes:<p>- I&#x27;m not claiming to have a large amount of data to back this up, hence why I said this is a &quot;hypothesis&quot;.

My friend and his husband offered to allow him to keep all of his stuff (over 20 large black bags that piled over 3 feet into the air on the bed, closet, and floor) and his 4 cats, which he declined.<p>The last call after 1 am, was the only time Airbnb removed the reservation because we informed them the police were involved and removed the individual.

Quilt is a versioned data portal for S3 that makes it easier to share, discover, model, and decide based on data at scale. It consists of a Python client, web catalog, and lambda functions (all open source), plus a suite of backend containers and CloudFormation templates for businesses to run their own stacks. Public data are free. Private stacks are available for a flat monthly licensing fee.<p>Try searching for anything on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;open.quiltdata.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;open.quiltdata.com&#x2F;</a> and let us know how search works for you. We kind of surprised ourselves with a Google-like experience that returns primary data instead of links to web pages. We&#x27;ve got over 1M Jupyter notebooks, 100M Amazon reviews, and many more public S3 objects on over a dozen topics indexed in ElasticSearch.<p>The best example, so far, of &quot;S3 bucket as data repo&quot; is from the Allen Institute for Cell Science <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;open.quiltdata.com&#x2F;b&#x2F;allencell&#x2F;tree&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;open.quiltdata.com&#x2F;b&#x2F;allencell&#x2F;tree&#x2F;</a>.<p>Kevin and I met in grad school. We started with the belief that if data could be &quot;managed like code,&quot; data would be easier to access, more accurate, and could serve as the foundation for smarter decisions. While we loved databases and systems, we found that technical and cost barriers kept data out of the hands of people that needed it the most: NGOs, citizens, and non-technical users. That led to three distinct iterations of Quilt over as many years and has now culminated in open.quiltdata.com, where we&#x27;ve made a few petabytes of public data in S3 easy to search, browse, visualize, and summarize.<p>In earlier versions of Quilt, we focused on writing new software to version and package data. We also attempted to host private user data in our own cloud. For reasons that we would soon realize, these were mistakes:<p>* Few users were willing to copy data—especially sensitive and large data—into Quilt<p>* It was difficult to gather a critical mass of interesting and useful data that would keep users coming back<p>* Data are consumed in teams that include a variety of non-technical users<p>* Even in 2019, it&#x27;s unnecessarily difficult and expensive to host and share large files. (GitHub, Dropbox, and Google Drive all have quotas, performance limitations, and none of them can serve as a distributed backend for an application.)<p>* It&#x27;s difficult for a small team to build both &quot;git for data&quot; (core tech) and &quot;Github for data&quot; (website + network effect) at the same time<p>On the plus side, our users confirmed that &quot;immutable data dependencies&quot; (something Quilt still does) went a long way towards making analysis reproducible and trace-able.<p>Put all of the above together, and we had the realization that if we viewed S3 as &quot;git for data&quot;, it would solve a lot of problems at once: S3 supports object versioning, a huge chunk of public and customer data are already there (no copying), and it keeps users in direct control of their own data. Looking forward, the S3 interface is general enough (especially with tools like min.io) to abstract away any storage layer. And we want to bring Quilt to other clouds, and even to on-prem volumes. We repurposed our &quot;immutable dataset abstraction&quot; (Quilt packages) and used them to solve a problem that S3 object versioning doesn&#x27;t: the ability to take an immutable snapshot of an entire directory, bucket, or collection of buckets.<p>We believe that public data should be free and open to all—with no competing interests from advertisers—that private data should be secure, and that all data should remain under the direct control of its creators. We feel that a &quot;federated network of S3 buckets&quot; offers the foundations on which to achieve such a vision.<p>All of that said, wow do we have a long way to go. We ran into all kinds of challenges scaling and sharding ElasticSearch to accommodate the 10 billion objects on open.quiltdata.com, and we are still researching the best way to fork and merge datasets. (The Quilt package manifests are JSONL, so our leading theory is to check these into git so that diffs and merges can be accomplished over S3 key metadata, without the need to diff or even touch primary data in S3, which are too large to fit into git anyway.)<p>Your comments, design suggestions, and open source contributions to any of the above topics are welcomed.","time":1569348407,"title":"Launch HN: Quilt (YC W16) – A versioned data portal for S3","type":"story"},{"by":"paulygarcia","descendants":172,"id":21062799,"kids":[21063121,21065129,21063123,21067793,21068216,21065047,21064965,21064506,21063676,21065501,21063556,21064021,21063534,21068199,21063550,21063663,21063927,21064468,21064074,21063887,21063877,21063665,21065139],"score":474,"time":1569347478,"title":"OSSU: A path to a free self-taught education in computer science","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/ossu/computer-science"},{"by":"yarapavan","descendants":12,"id":21063179,"kids":[21063657,21063649,21063587,21063592,21063510,21065799,21063747,21063434,21063799,21063668],"score":24,"time":1569349670,"title":"The Moral Peril of Meritocracy","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/06/opinion/sunday/moral-revolution-david-brooks.html"},{"by":"worstestes","descendants":63,"id":21062891,"kids":[21063714,21063417,21064258,21063866,21063659,21063356,21064588,21064520,21067386,21066685,21065635,21064350],"score":99,"time":1569347878,"title":"MegaBots calls it a day, puts fighting robot up for sale on eBay","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/megabots-calls-it-a-day-puts-fighting-robot-up-for-sale-on-ebay/"},{"by":"mese848","descendants":6,"id":21062617,"kids":[21064394,21063942,21063697,21066001,21063056,21065783],"score":18,"time":1569346513,"title":"Good writing is lean, clean, and easy to read","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/swlh/write-to-express-not-to-impress-465d628f39fe"},{"by":"dmfjfj","descendants":2,"id":21062491,"kids":[21062627,21120067],"score":2,"text":"I was wondering if anyone is using their managed databases for production and what&#x27;s your review of their reliability?

A year ago he approached me with a radical idea: there is a sea change happening in his industry that will force companies to abandon existing software infrastructure, and he had an idea that addresses this sea change in a way that does not force his customers to make billion dollar reinvestments in their networks and handles with a new suite of software instead.<p>I was working as a consultant and setup a company (using Stripe) and for the last year have been building the software. We are close to having several large banking customers do paid trials.The software works and is radically different than anything else out there, but it fits easily into existing solutions and the sales cycle is not alien.<p>My friend works for another company in the same industry. When he first had this idea, he told them about it, and they declined to act on it. He has this documented, by the way. It would have cannibalized their opportunities as a reseller of technologies that compete with this new offering.<p>I&#x27;ve taken zero investment up to this point. There is also no revenue yet.<p>My questions are:<p>1. He will leave his current employer soon. How do I let him buy into the company and purchase a large equity stake (for very little cash) without drawing the ire of the IRS if there is a later large sale?<p>2. He has some debt, so one thing he would like to do (and I&#x27;m 100% on board about) is letting him purchase stock at a very reduced rate now. Then, when we prove the opportunity and several of these banks do paid trials for $50k or so, the company buys back some of the stock from him (at a very different rate). This obviously establishes a very different valuation for the company, and allows him to reduce his personal debt.<p>Are there better ways to do this? If I offered him a position on the team (as a C-level executive), could I grant him a large equity stake (say 25%)?","time":1569212204,"title":"Ask HN: How to invite a silent partner into startup with

I was recently laid off and did not stick to what I knew I should have done by not putting out the first number. The firm asked me for my &quot;take out&quot; number and I quoted what I thought was pretty high. They wound up exceeding my figure by 7k which I thought was a nice gesture but not a good sign as to if my anchor was high enough. Now I&#x27;m kicking myself by not putting out a much higher initial figure. However, I do know by talking to a 3rd party recruiter that I got the offer over a candidate they were working with, so maybe I&#x27;d be upset the other way if I put out too high of a figure and didn&#x27;t get the job. I know that &quot;being affordable&quot; is a thing and that if a candidate is too expensive a company might go with their second but less expensive option.<p>I&#x27;ll have a chance to discuss salary in 6 months but unless I really crush it I doubt there is room for movement so soon after starting.<p>In any case, if anyone has some good insight into how to figure out what I could be making I&#x27;d appreciate it.

This is where things get very unusual. I logged into my stocktwits account and noticed I had received a message from somebody inquiring about the same stock, SEAC.<p>I found this very unusual because it is thinly traded, and I had never mentioned it to anybody before. I compared the time of the stocktwits message to the time in my search history, and things became even more creepy. My history (which I hadn&#x27;t cleared in several weeks) showed my first search for SEAC was at 8:22pm, September 05, 2019, and the message I received on stocktwits was at 8:34pm, only 10 minutes later.<p>In the message, the person requested I follow them so we could have a private conversation, and I immediately confronted the person about this strange time correlation. They just brushed it off. We talked for a bit longer than I said I had to go, and the next day I decided to screen record everything just in case.<p>When I confronted the person today, they again brushed it off, but this time I decided to be more forceful and said -- basically in laymen terms -- <i></i><i></i> off and leave me alone, and this is where it gets very creepy. When I looked at my search history a few hours later, it had completely changed. It showed that I had been viewing SEAC once per day since the beginning of August.<p>No this is not all in my head, and I have video evidence. I also know that I do not follow that stock, and have never heard of it until last night. I am at a loss. I am at a complete loss as to what I am to do about this.   Many possibilities come to mind.

Curious what people smarter than myself think.<p>There are $1.4 T in excess reserves deposited at the Fed currently. The Fed pays interest on those reserves at 1.80%.<p>Banks have to maintain at least a certain amount of required reserves with the Fed. When they do not have these reserves, they can borrow them from banks that have excess reserves. (They can also borrow them from the Fed via the discount window, but generally don&#x27;t, due to stigma.)<p>This borrowing is usually done via the repo market. In a repo, the borrower pledges some collateral--usually government debt, and agrees to repurchase the asset e.g. the following day. To incentivize a lender to enter such an agreement, the interest rate on such a deal must be greater than what the lender could receive from the Fed for IOER.<p>Per media reports, interest rates in the repo market at one point spiked as high as 10%. The media has cited a &quot;dollar shortage&quot; caused by taxes being owed and institutions having purchased large amounts of US federal debt recently, both of which decrease central bank reserves. But, there are still $1.4 T in excess reserves. And we&#x27;re talking about a very safe loan: collateralized by sovereign debt (usually) and overnight. So, if someone wanted to borrow them at a &quot;reasonable&quot; rate, they should have been able, assuming they had the collateral.<p>Assuming they had the collateral. The attack on the Saudi oil facilities, and the 15% spike in oil prices that resulted very well could have been a black swan event that has caused what we&#x27;re now seeing. The timing certainly is coincidental. Note also that the Fed knew that Lehman was insolvent about a month before it was publicly reported.<p>Meanwhile, the Fed has announced it&#x27;s going to perform repo operations for a fourth time this week tomorrow morning.","time":1568929962,"title":"Fed Intervention in the Repo Market","type":"story"},{"by":"tempsy","descendants":3,"id":21021002,"kids":[21021884,21022584],"score":47,"time":1568929167,"title":"Employee dies at Facebook's Silicon Valley headquarters in apparent suicide","type":"story","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/one-person-dead-by-suicide-at-facebook-office-building-2019-9"},{"by":"Anon84","descendants":146,"id":21020682,"kids":[21022969,21022525,21021802,21021667,21021346,21022403,21022298,21022216,21023424,21027720,21023752,21022806,21023958,21022021,21023181,21022284,21021979,21021264,21023142,21025263,21023260,21023977,21023464,21021515,21021807,21023800,21022056],"score":379,"time":1568926582,"title":"The U.S. economy is growing and using less and less stuff to do so","type":"story","url":"https://hbr.org/ideacast/2019/09/dematerialization-and-what-it-means-for-the-economy-and-climate-change"},{"by":"uptownfunk","descendants":3,"id":21020539,"kids":[21024693,21030121,21020597],"score":3,"time":1568925713,"title":"Ask HN: Which APIs do you dislike?

We&#x27;ve built a new desktop app to purchase Bitcoin with USD directly into your wallet using the Lightning Network, instantly. This is not Bitcoin held in your name by an institution - it’s your wallet, and your private keys.<p>Today, the vast majority of the billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin^1 traded on a daily basis is done on custodial exchanges, meaning users deposit their currencies with the exchange, trade within the system, and then withdraw their new currency balance at a later time. This runs counter to the original goal of Bitcoin, which was to give users full control of their money through a system without central authorities or middlemen. Unfortunately, users historically haven’t had much of a choice, as using custodial exchanges has been the only way to get reliable pricing, use a bank account, and achieve reasonable settlement times for transactions.<p>Then came the Lightning Network (LN), first introduced in 2016 in this white paper: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lightning.network&#x2F;lightning-network-paper.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lightning.network&#x2F;lightning-network-paper.pdf</a>. One of the original goals of the LN was to solve Bitcoin’s scalability problem. It works by creating a second <i>local</i> consensus layer between two parties on top of the main Bitcoin blockchain, only going back to layer 1 for final settlement or dispute resolution, thereby decongesting the main blockchain and enabling faster transaction speeds. At Sparkswap, we’re taking advantage of Lightning’s fast transaction speeds to build an alternative to existing custodial exchanges: for the first time, you can have fast, convenient trading without custodial trust.<p>I started working on Bitcoin after two years in wealth management technology at BlackRock, where I got to see how the financial system operates at a mechanical level. As an engineer, looking at the antiquated way that money actually moves around the system (you’d be surprised how many FTP uploads and CSVs are involved) and how reliant it is on a small group of institutions that have to trust each other, it was immediately clear to me that we can do much better. Bitcoin offers a way to re-architect our financial system in an internet-native way that removes reliance on those central parties, opening opportunities for more people to access it, and for new service providers to thrive like they have on the internet. But there is still a lot of work to be done to solve fundamental problems like custody - and that&#x27;s why I started working on Sparkswap.<p>After almost two years of hard work, we’ve just launched Sparkswap Desktop, our Lightning-powered app for buying Bitcoin. With the app, because every purchase is executed on the LN, it’s both instantaneous and you never have to give up control of your Bitcoin private keys. As the saying goes, not your keys, not your coins^2.<p>Here&#x27;s how it works. When you deposit USD via ACH in the open source Sparkswap app (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sparkswap&#x2F;sparkswap-desktop\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sparkswap&#x2F;sparkswap-desktop</a>), it is sent to a US-domiciled bank account that Sparkswap (the company) doesn&#x27;t own or control. Then later when you buy Bitcoin in the app, the Bitcoin payment to you is put in escrow (called a Hash&#x2F;Time-lock Contract, or HTLC) locked by a cryptographic hash on the Lightning Network. This means that if you can produce the preimage of the hash, you get the Bitcoin, but at this point only Sparkswap knows the preimage. Then the app creates an escrow payment to Sparkswap for the USD price of the Bitcoin locked by the same hash using our payment partner. Since Sparkswap has the preimage, we can then immediately claim the escrowed dollars by sending the preimage to our payment partner. This gives you access to the preimage through our payment partner’s API, which the app then uses to claim the BTC on your behalf. The escrows also have timeouts so that they can be canceled if they aren&#x27;t executed after a certain time. This whole process results in USD being swapped for BTC with a level of security that popular services don&#x27;t provide, and in most cases swaps complete in just a few seconds.<p>In addition, every Bitcoin you buy with Sparkswap is instantly available in a channel on the Lightning Network. That means that you can easily spend that Bitcoin on the dozens of games, apps, and merchants building Lightning-powered services. And since Sparkswap opens Lightning channels to you, after initial setup you can transfer funds from your bank, buy Bitcoin, and spend it on the Lightning Network all in a matter of seconds, making it one of the easiest ways to get started on Lightning.<p>The first version of the app is designed for users that run LND (a popular Lightning node, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lightningnetwork&#x2F;lnd\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lightningnetwork&#x2F;lnd</a>) already. If you don’t, we recommend Zap (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LN-Zap&#x2F;zap-desktop&#x2F;releases\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LN-Zap&#x2F;zap-desktop&#x2F;releases</a>), a desktop Lightning Wallet that lets you run a light client so you don’t have to sync the full blockchain. The current release of Sparkswap Desktop also only supports purchasing Bitcoin with USD. However, we have plans to support selling Bitcoin, as well as other Lightning implementations and clients (and mobile!), so stay tuned for updates.<p>We know cryptocurrency certainly has its issues, and we’re working to try to fix one of them. In just the first half of 2019, almost $500M^3 was stolen from custodial exchanges. We believe it’s critical to the value and future success of Bitcoin to establish trustless, non-custodial trading. We don’t have a token, and we’re not selling vaporware - we’ve shipped a real product that solves a real problem and enhances the biggest proven use case in the cryptocurrency industry: buying Bitcoin.<p>We&#x27;d love feedback on the product from all — Lightning Network enthusiasts, critics, and those that don’t know much about it. If you have any trouble getting started, please ask us for help! (support at sparkswap.com)<p>Thanks!<p>Trey<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coindesk.com&#x2F;bitcoin-trading-volume-tops-11-billion-for-first-time-in-nearly-a-year\"

Additionally, an E-2C Hawkeye plane in the area confirmed radar returns from these objects. Two F18 Super Hornets were tasked by the Nimitz with interception. Each jet had individual advanced AESA radar onboard and the information from these 2 systems was sent back to the Nimitz in real time. Each jet was also equipped with an Raytheon ATFLIR camera pod integrated into the gun sight tracking system and heads up display. This system is a single pod that combines mid-wave infrared targeting and navigation FLIRs, an electro-optical, or visual light, sensor, a laser rangefinder and target designator, and a laser spot-tracker. It can locate and designate targets day or night at ranges exceeding 40 nautical miles and altitudes surpassing 50,000 feet.

Dashblock turns any website into an API. People use us to access product information, news content, sales-related data or real-estate offers for instance.<p>As a data scientist, Hugues realised how complicated it was to access web data programmatically when a website doesn&#x27;t provide an API. You have to build a script to pull the HTML, render the page in some cases, find selectors for the information you are interested in, distribute your tasks to scale and if the structure of the page changes, you have to update your selectors to find back the information.<p>We decided to build Dashblock to make it really simple to access web data through an API. Our software is basically a browser that allows you to access a website, right-click on the information you want to extract and preview your API on other pages.<p>In order to create long-lasting APIs, we developed a machine learning model that is resilient to website updates. For now, we mainly handle changes at the level of the HTML structure but with enough training data, we will also be resilient to UI updates.<p>Besides, our model detects similar content on the page to facilitate the selection process. When you call your API, we launch a headless browser, render the page, classify the content of the page using structural, visual and semantic features, and structure it by minimizing the entropy to give you a list when needed.<p>Our pricing model is related to the number of API calls our users make per month and if you want to give it a try, we currently offer 10k API calls when you sign up! You can download our software here : dashblock.com.<p>If you have any questions, we would be happy to answer them and if you have any related ideas, feedbacks or experiences, feel free to share them :)<p>Thank you !","time":1568820990,"title":"Launch HN: Dashblock (YC S19) – Turn Any Website into an API","type":"story"},{"by":"bgrynol","descendants":18,"id":21006405,"kids":[21018693,21006598,21016447,21006810,21015825],"score":78,"time":1568820474,"title":"Andrew Mason’s Descript raises $15M and acquires Lyrebird","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/18/descript-audio/"},{"by":"cryptoctk","descendants":1,"id":21006398,"kids":[21006402,21006471],"score":1,"time":1568820443,"title":"A lightweight cryptocurrency portfolio tracker","type":"story","url":"https://coinval.co"},{"by":"doener","descendants":2,"id":21006369,"kids":[21006424,21007924],"score":1,"time":1568820264,"title":"Advanced Chess","type":"story","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Chess"},{"by":"howard941","descendants":7,"id":21006207,"kids":[21012016,21006540],"score":4,"time":1568819452,"title":"Why baby boomers’ grandchildren will hate them","type":"story","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/09/17/why-baby-boomers-grandchildren-will-hate-them/"},{"by":"thebent","descendants":4,"id":21006150,"kids":[21007061,21006773,21006636,21006647,21010985],"score":26,"time":1568819114,"title":"Facebook's Julie Zhuo on Leaping from Individual Contributor to Force Multiplier","type":"story","url":"https://blog.gitprime.com/individual-contributor-to-manager-julie-zhuo/"},{"by":"rwolf","descendants":43,"id":21006252,"kids":[21006438,21007798,21008528,21008200],"score":83,"time":1568819671,"title":"A Reflection on the Departure of RMS","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@thomas.bushnell/a-reflection-on-the-departure-of-rms-18e6a835fd84"},{"by":"equalunique","descendants":2,"id":21006031,"kids":[21009424,21006530],"score":6,"text":"When you have logs that need to be &quot;sanitized&quot; (i.e., clear any identifying information like IP addresses, host names, usernames, etc.), what tools do you find most useful?","time":1568818395,"title":"Ask HN: Recommend Log Sanitizers","type":"story"},{"by":"theafh","descendants":3,"id":21006160,"kids":[21008560,21008013,21008634],"score":20,"time":1568819146,"title":"Project Ihmehimmeli: Temporal Coding in Spiking Neural Networks","type":"story","url":"https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/09/project-ihmehimmeli-temporal-coding-in.html"},{"by":"auslegung","descendants":4,"id":21007183,"kids":[21008450,21007218,21007455],"score":2,"text":"Anyone here have experience working as a full time contractor?

As the crisis appears to increasingly be a political and cultural problem, what might be effective ways to use engineering in the service of climate-related politics?","time":1568769364,"title":"Ask HN: What's the best thing a software engineer can do for climate change?","type":"story"},{"by":"OrgNet","descendants":3,"id":21001792,"kids":[21002074,21002718],"score":1,"text":"I tried a few books, and Google changes the rules so quickly that the books were already outdated.","time":1568771333,"title":"Ask HN: Most Current Kotlin/Android-Studio Learning Material?","type":"story"},{"by":"tuke","descendants":3,"id":21001773,"kids":[21002336,21001902],"score":3,"time":1568771112,"title":"Nudge your staff to get TSA Pre","type":"story","url":"https://7fff.com/2019/09/nudge-your-staff-to-get-tsa-pre/"},{"by":"benologist","descendants":22,"id":21001514,"kids":[21001790,21001769,21001695,21001752,21001804,21001723],"score":36,"time":1568767830,"title":"Cutting Health Benefits of 1,900 Workers Saved Bezos What He Makes in Six Hours","type":"story","url":"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/09/17/cutting-health-benefits-1900-whole-food-workers-saved-worlds-richest-man-jeff-bezos"},{"by":"pchiusano","descendants":7,"id":21001375,"kids":[21002297,21004655,21002331,21002591],"score":55,"time":1568766116,"title":"A Better Lesson","type":"story","url":"https://rodneybrooks.com/a-better-lesson/"},{"by":"Avi-D-coder","descendants":28,"id":21001280,"kids":[21009675,21005759,21005705,21006036,21007562,21005895],"score":106,"time":1568764899,"title":"Announcing Yugabyte DB 2.0 GA: High-Performance Distributed SQL","type":"story","url":"https://blog.yugabyte.com/announcing-yugabyte-db-2-0-ga-jepsen-tested-high-performance-distributed-sql/"},{"by":"_bxg1","descendants":4,"id":21000990,"kids":[21001104,21002092],"score":1,"text":"I recently went through an interview process at a company I like, in which I made it to the very last round before being turned down in favor of another candidate.
