We make eating healthy easy and enjoyable by enhancing the taste of nutritious foods.<p>Junk foods have been weaponized to taste amazing and be addictive. This has led to an obesity epidemic with 39.8% of American adults afflicted. Although 63% of Americans say they try to eat healthy most or all of the time, 85% admit they give in to over half of their cravings for indulgent foods. Diets suck and often fail because people are unable to find changes that they enjoy and can incorporate into their lifestyle.<p>I’ve created a next generation sweetener. It doesn’t just sweeten food, it removes the unpleasant tartness and bitterness that makes a food an acquired taste, allowing you to discover the natural flavors that were previously masked. Its unique mechanism provides it advantages over any other sweetener: 1) It has no bitter&#x2F;chemical aftertaste 2) It requires only a single serving irregardless of the quantity of food in your meal 3) There is a uniform effect- no stirring necessary 4) It gives you the power to target the individual, not the food for everyone at the dinner table.<p>Check out this incredible behavioral transformation: &lt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;fLmeCbotvYI&gt;<p>I started working on this when a fun experiment with my nephew revealed interesting implications.

It makes me gag.” As the yogurt hit his lips, he patted his belly with delight and exclaimed, “Wow this tastes like a milkshake! More please!” From that moment, I realized that this compound could be harnessed to create lasting behavior changes in a way that positively benefits one’s health.<p>HN, I’d love to hear all of your feedback and advice.

Playing games together in VR sounds fun but even just chatting with avatars seems like a great way to stay connected.","time":1587929356,"title":"Ask HN: Has anyone been using VR to socialize lately?","type":"story"},{"by":"ahmetbcakici","descendants":2,"id":22989491,"kids":[22992534,22989561],"score":1,"time":1587929270,"title":"Show HN: I made a shareable timer as beginner, waiting for your feedbacks","type":"story","url":"https://ahmetbcakici.github.io/justimer-client"},{"by":"peter_d_sherman","descendants":6,"id":22989312,"kids":[22989903,22989517,22989482,22989791,22989986],"score":20,"time":1587927827,"title":"Magnetocapacitance","type":"story","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetocapacitance"},{"by":"tareqak","descendants":22,"id":22989368,"kids":[22990118,22989881,22989845,23029178,22989965,23062953],"score":52,"time":1587928407,"title":"German minister backs creating legal right to work from home","type":"story","url":"https://apnews.com/44740743a698a80c058b75b8f8af3c8e"},{"by":"qqqqquinnnnn","descendants":813,"id":22989280,"kids":[22991041,22994506,22990784,22990481,22991401,22991498,22991727,22991200,22992439,22990550,22991758,22991991,22990029,22990282,22993058,22990480,22993230,22991526,22990597,22990564,22990922,22991418,22989836,22989964,22990828,22990606,22995315,22992989,22993927,22989979,22990571,22990525,22996839,22990727,22991625,22991671,22995853,22990663,22994403,22989712,22993397,22991554,22991641,22989665,22989690,22990575,22993553,22995685,22994294,22990742,22990455,22992700,22990845,22990565,22991332,22990199,22993983,22990478,22992940,22990171,22992709,22991707,22992762,23000735,22991699,22990120,22990009,22995626,22993709,22991084,22993686,22993973,22992708,22995582,22994563,23015981,22994107,22993382,22994289,22990055,22993854,22989813,22991230,22991053,22992880,22995730,22991745,22995533,22992738,22993607,22993855,22993581,22990646,23002633,22992946,22992419,22994398,22992948,22990932,22992353,22992618,22990621,22995705,22993053,22994954,22993967,22991178,22991309,22990144,22990555,22991901,22995557,22992816,22992315,22991693,22993574,22991965,22992081,22995394,22993691,22996870,22990792,22994633,22991303,22989828,22990586,22990499,22990660,22994177,22993361,22993302,22991023,22990293,22989843,23002576,22989756,22991265,22990537,22994724,22991469,23000522,22992967,22991631,22992250,23001037,22991721,22993107,22994174,22991629],"score":607,"text":"I&#x27;ve been studying viruses lately, and have found that the line between virus&#x2F;exosome&#x2F;self is much more blurry than I realized.

And can we essentially manoeuvre Hubble to pick up past events “live”?\nIt’s almost like having a drone above us but feeding us images from the past. \nSorry about the long question :(","time":1587868748,"title":"Ask HN: Telescope as a Window to Our Past","type":"story"},{"by":"chovy","descendants":5,"id":22983951,"kids":[22984005,22987354,22984435],"score":7,"time":1587869754,"title":"The Gardener","type":"story","url":"https://theultimategardener.com/"},{"by":"pj3677","descendants":15,"id":22983691,"kids":[22986982,22988493,22984798,22984566,22988170],"score":152,"time":1587867050,"title":"Beginners guide to gateways and proxies","type":"story","url":"https://www.learncloudnative.com/blog/2020-04-25-beginners-guide-to-gateways-proxies/"},{"by":"harambae","descendants":32,"id":22983678,"kids":[22984403,22984960,22985837,22985954,22984354],"score":25,"time":1587866943,"title":"‘Quarantine fatigue’: Researchers find more Americans venturing against orders","type":"story","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/quarantine-fatigue-researchers-find-more-americans-venturing-out-against-coronavirus-stay-at-home-orders/2020/04/25/fa1f01b2-84a3-11ea-a3eb-e9fc93160703_story.html"},{"by":"AndrewBissell","descendants":42,"id":22983660,"kids":[22984442,22986549,22986524,22984502,22984675,22985767,22984192,22984539,22984226],"score":87,"time":1587866813,"title":"Labour HQ used Facebook ads to deceive Jeremy Corbyn during election campaign","type":"story","url":"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/labour-hq-used-facebook-ads-to-deceive-jeremy-corbyn-during-election-campaign-grlx75c27"},{"by":"btilly","descendants":4,"id":22983514,"kids":[22983832,22984744],"score":2,"time":1587865573,"title":"'No Evidence' yet That Recovered Covid-19 Patients Are Immune, WHO Says","type":"story","url":"https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/25/844939777/no-evidence-that-recovered-covid-19-patients-are-immune-who-says"},{"by":"snappr_","descendants":2,"id":22983396,"kids":[22983541,22983698],"score":1,"text":"Recently I downloaded a pdf document in chrome, and a banner appeared at the top of the browser window saying that McAfee Webadvisor was scanning the file.<p>Interesting, because I did not install it.<p>So I go to add remove programs, and uninstall anything that I see that is McAfee related.<p>A couple of days later, the fan in my pc is spinning louder than usual, so I open up task manager, and lo and behold - the resource hog is non other than McAfee Webadvisor.<p>Question: how does one completely remove every trace of McAfee from a Windows PC, and ensure that it does not reappear?","time":1587864248,"title":"How does one fully remove McAfee?","type":"story"},{"by":"giardini","dead":true,"id":22983469,"kids":[22983583,22983496,22983472],"score":3,"time":1587865083,"title":"Trump Did Not Say We Should Inject Ourselves, He Said the Opposite","type":"story","url":"https://lidblog.com/inject-ourselves-with-disinfectant/"},{"by":"bumbledraven","descendants":76,"id":22983274,"kids":[22985213,22984168,22985188,22984146,22984201,22985464,22984154,22984398,22984189,22984222,22987852,22984135,22991256,22984880,22985232,22986832,22987960,22986042,22987025,22984663,22987108,22989703],"score":150,"time":1587863245,"title":"Tips for Mathematical Handwriting (2007)","type":"story","url":"https://johnkerl.org/doc/ortho/ortho.html"},{"by":"lelf","descendants":41,"id":22983155,"kids":[22987253,22989507,22990321,22990018,22991729,22987110,22988503,22987161,22987129,22989361,22987258,22988560,22988800,22987673],"score":163,"time":1587862130,"title":"How I photograph the Milky Way with medium format film","type":"story","url":"https://petapixel.com/2020/04/25/how-i-photograph-the-milky-way-with-medium-format-film/"},{"by":"iamwil","descendants":6,"id":22983160,"kids":[22983187,22985258,22984061,23010437,23007952,22983167],"score":7,"text":"I remember seeing on HN a while ago free software that people use to layout and plan out the interior of their home.

I am a CS graduate and I have been working for 3 months as a backend developer in a company (in Italy) that delivers mobile and web apps, like many others.<p>The first problem that I&#x27;m facing is that my senior (and my junior teammates) constantly takes bad programming decisions that affects the long-term stability of the project, such as ugly db models or not following the single-responsibility principle for example. He gets to choose all the design but he&#x27;s not the one coding so he also does not realise the errors by himself.<p>The second problem is that my company, like I think many small companies that work for clients, accepts projects with low budget and thus there is not enough time to properly write good code (we write js backends without testing &gt;.&gt;).<p>Obviously I&#x27;m not here just to complain. I thought about some solutions I can opt for:<p>- Work for a big tech company where there is less hurry to finish projects and there are clear coding rules to follow (like testing and so on). Good pay, less pressure but maybe no real engagement of designing complex systems (don&#x27;t really know).<p>- Learn frontend technologies and try to slowly become a full stack freelancer. Good pay (hopefully), no boss and I get to design the systems. The problem is getting started, make the connections, build a resume and learn how to do it properly.<p>- Change from backend to frontend, where maybe design is not so important, though I don&#x27;t really like it.<p>- Change to some other field like ML, but I would need some time to study and I don&#x27;t think I could get a job without a master&#x27;s degree (you tell me).<p>I&#x27;m really thirsty for your advice.

Sure, the syntax looks as if it were developed in a vacuum, but I can get used to that eventually. The real reason is the docs suck. Not the docs for the language or the Phoenix framework, but the docs for all the little surrounding libraries you&#x27;ll need for every project. The docs for Goth (GCP authentication) were very lacking and I&#x27;ve spent the entire day trying to make a POST request with HTTPoison and I just cannot get it to work. It seems like the correct response is being received but there seems to be the wrong number of params or something. I can literally see the response on the error page, but the program refuses to accept it. The only relevant example in the repo is a GET request and it does not appear to work for POST, and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any relevant answers on SO. I feel like if it takes a day to figure out how to make a POST request work it cancels out the supposed benefits you get down the road no matter how great they are. At this point, it seems the practical next move would be to just do it in python (or node.js). The docs for python aren&#x27;t great either (a beginner would struggle to install pip), but you generally won&#x27;t get stuck for days on trivial problems.

I&#x27;m quickly approaching my mid 40&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve worked everywhere from small start ups to huge corporate gigs. All the roles I had were 100% HTML, CSS and JS (99% jQuery).<p>My problem:<p>About five years ago, I took a role at a large health care company. The first work they had me doing was AngularJs (brand new at the time - version 1.3), mixed with AEM (enterprise CMS) and Bootstrap. I was stoked, new JS framework just when everything was transitioning to full stack JS - this is exactly where I need to be! The project lasted 18 months. Then we lost the large government contract we were working on. The teams were all disbanded and pieced out to other teams. I was sent to another team which worked on portals. It was a 10-15 year old CMS. I was now back working with inline CSS, inline JS all over the place. I just kind of settled in to being a glorified content guy that fixes UI bugs. I just thought, &quot;Well, this isn&#x27;t the hardest job, so why rock the boat?&quot;<p>This is where I am. Stuck in the middle of the road, during a pandemic that has everything shut down and nobody is hiring. Yes, I still have a job and a &quot;career&quot; but I&#x27;m not happy and I realize I need to do SOMETHING to find a more modern role where I can develop whatever skills I need to get out of this gutter I&#x27;ve slid into it. I realize this means taking a step down in pay, taking a step back from a senior level position to a mid or even entry level position.

But is the web built for development ease or user happiness &#x2F; interaction and discoverability. 90% of people (UX &#x2F; marketers &#x2F; investors and non developers would say the latter). Therefore are the wins you get with Next.js when setting up routing, which should be a one time only thing anyway, little benefit when compared to Gatsby and the ease of updating content and the part I still don&#x27;t get enough info on - does the SSR from Next.js overall help with SEO or can the same be obtained from Gatsby? If I&#x27;ve overlooked anything here - shout out and tell me, I&#x27;m by no means right or wrong, but very interested to hear all opinions on the matter.","time":1587613780,"title":"Next.js or Gatsby – for the end user and SEO","type":"story"},{"by":"alexeiz","descendants":76,"id":22952573,"kids":[22952942,22953090,22952913,22953529,22952968,22953133,22952912,22953000,22952959,22953533,22953061,22953199,22953024,22953790,22968547,22953376,22953068,22955016,22952927,22953186,22953554,22953038,22953168],"score":93,"time":1587612726,"title":"Ubuntu Deepin Desktop Environment","type":"story","url":"https://ubuntudde.com/"},{"by":"saeranv","descendants":218,"id":22952572,"kids":[22959188,22959255,22959193,22954330,22952957,22959052,22959373,22959253,22960416,22959292,22959235,22959894,22959160,22960024,22960452,22960108,22958863,22960185,22961008,22959026,22961137,22959617,22959701],"score":221,"time":1587612720,"title":"Why We Can't Build","type":"story","url":"https://www.vox.com/2020/4/22/21228469/marc-andreessen-build-government-coronavirus"},{"by":"sethbannon","descendants":35,"id":22952131,"kids":[22952800,22953150,22953455,22953876,22953030,22964163,22954093,22957306,22953052,22956011,22953584,22953494],"score":104,"time":1587606999,"title":"When Tailwinds Vanish","type":"story","url":"https://luttig.substack.com/p/when-tailwinds-vanish"},{"by":"FabHK","descendants":302,"id":22952085,"kids":[22953456,22952872,22954507,22952706,22952719,22952665,22952683,22953478,22952709,22952904,22956855,22952690,22954292,22953942,22955792,22963569,22957038,22955511,22955375,22954191,22953700,22953745,22954918,22952718,22955750,22955966,22954591,22953871,22953617,22955838,22952795,22953244,22957347,22952643,22955891,22952657,22952818,22953327],"score":298,"time":1587606586,"title":"The 2020 iPhone SE","type":"story","url":"https://daringfireball.net/2020/04/the_2020_iphone_se"},{"by":"andrewnc","descendants":41,"id":22952070,"kids":[22966024,22964523,22964091,22965603,22964316,22969160,22964376,22964886,22965454,22965349,22965016,22968969,22965448,22967774,22964404],"score":76,"time":1587606478,"title":"Does Irrationality Fuel Innovation?","type":"story","url":"https://juliagalef.com/2017/04/07/does-irrationality-fuel-innovation/"},{"by":"danielam","descendants":8,"id":22951986,"kids":[22958897,22962697,22958431],"score":26,"time":1587605755,"title":"St. Hildegard's Litteræ Ignotæ (2016)","type":"story","url":"http://www.u.arizona.edu/~aversa/scholastic/Hildegard.html"},{"by":"mrfusion","descendants":10,"id":22951892,"kids":[22955822,22952308,22951953,22952019,22952010],"score":6,"time":1587604769,"title":"The data is in – stop the panic and end the total isolation","type":"story","url":"https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/494034-the-data-are-in-stop-the-panic-and-end-the-total-isolation"},{"by":"9nGQluzmnq3M","descendants":113,"id":22951790,"kids":[22952024,22952155,22952218,22954306,22953571,22953269,22952063,22952439,22952481,22952297,22952767,22952774,22960428,22956274,22952480,22952192,22956726,22953053,22953435,22957055,22952616,22952172,22952035],"score":189,"time":1587603406,"title":"Anthos support for multi-cloud is generally available","type":"story","url":"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/anthos/anthos-for-aws-is-now-ga"},{"by":"theslurmmustflo","descendants":79,"id":22951634,"kids":[22951863,22951976,22951945,22952416,22952096,22951929,22952122,22952140,22951907,22952641,22952080],"score":50,"time":1587601743,"title":"U.S. Reels to a Meat Shortage and Prices Are Getting Weird","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-22/tyson-foods-to-indefinitely-suspend-waterloo-operations-k9bbgnr9"},{"by":"wyclif","descendants":14,"id":22951584,"kids":[22952615,22953726,22972653,22952474,22952636],"score":28,"time":1587601319,"title":"Brush up your COBOL: Why is a 60 year old language suddenly in demand?","type":"story","url":"https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/04/20/brush-up-your-cobol-why-is-a-60-year-old-language-suddenly-in-demand/"},{"by":"jonbaer","descendants":2,"id":22951434,"kids":[22951449,22952445],"score":3,"time":1587599702,"title":"Peak Oil, a Specimen Case of Apocalypic Thinking","type":"story","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/fossil-fuels/peak-oil-specimen-case-apocalypic-thinking"},{"by":"jktzes","descendants":2,"id":22951397,"kids":[22951458,22951411],"score":6,"text":"I am trying to build a mobile app that&#x27;s gonna handle a lot of private information.

in need of career advice. I&#x27;m a self-taught developer, I learned programming as a kid and always dabbled in it but I didn&#x27;t make it a career until 2014. Since then I&#x27;ve done a number of different things - automation for QA testing in Python, web development in Python, PHP, .NET, Javascript, and now I&#x27;m building cloud automation and management tools in Go, with some front-end interfaces built in Vue. I believe I&#x27;ve consistently provided very good value to my employers and many of the projects I&#x27;ve delivered are still in production several years later. I&#x27;ve also managed teams and have gotten pretty good at managing and delivering projects, but I wouldn&#x27;t call myself a project manager.  \nMy real question pertains to my future. I&#x27;m 36 and I&#x27;m starting to worry about being aged out. Also, I&#x27;m self-taught and I&#x27;m always learning and studying, but I really dislike leetcode. If I have a choice between building something and grinding on problems, I&#x27;m going to build something, or learn more about things that interest me like languages, compilers, interpreters etc.<p>My problem is that I&#x27;m really struggling getting job interviews, and then landing a job when I do get an interview. Last year I interviewed for a Django development job, something I&#x27;m perfectly qualified and capable of doing, but I didn&#x27;t get the job because the questions were all about the internal data structures of SQL, esoteric questions about Python internals, etc.<p>I&#x27;m at a loss for what my plan should be. Get a CS degree? Grind leetcode? I need to define a good path forward.

Two years ago I was diagnosed with a condition called &quot;Usher&#x27;s Syndrome&quot; - characterized by hearing loss, balance issues, and progressive vision loss.<p>I know there are blind software engineers out there. My main questions are:<p>- Are there blind frontend engineers?<p>- What kinds of software engineering lend themselves to someone with limited vision? Backend only?<p>- Besides a screen reader, what are some of the best tools for building software with limited vision?<p>- Does your company employ blind engineers? How well does it work? What kind of engineer are they?<p>I&#x27;m really trying to get ahead of this thing and prepare myself as my vision is degrading rather quickly. I&#x27;m not sure what I can do if I can&#x27;t do SE as I don&#x27;t have any formal education in anything.

We’ve always been heavy users of YouTube, for entertainment, education and sharing. Towards the end of last year, we saw more and more horror stories of YouTubers losing their livelihood to the ad algorithm.<p>We decided to build a content-first video platform, which aims to reduce issues by removing advertisers from the equation. Instead, we charge for the content you watch – bold, I know.<p>Instead of paying in advertising and data, users on Infstream build their own streaming package, a channel at a time. Anyone can start a channel (US &amp; UK now, Europe soon) and earn directly from their subscribers.<p>Subscribers pay $1 per month per channel, of which the channel receives $0.75. This all begins from the first subscriber, there are no minimums to start monetization.<p>Channels have total control, and can publish on a daily, weekly or monthly schedule – whatever is working for them and their subscribers. They’re free to keep publishing on other sites (we recommend it), and can promote exclusive content to their existing audience, quickly growing an ad-independent revenue stream.<p>We’re getting ready to launch, and are inviting creators to sign up beforehand to get their channel ready. If you or a connection has had issues with publishing on YouTube we’d love to hear from you, and learn some more about the pain points.<p>The platform is stocked with demo content, it would be great to get some feedback.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;infstream.com&#x2F;?code=HN<p>This was also my first production project using Hasura (super positive), so can share my experience if you’re considering trying it.<p>Stack:<p>- Hasura (GraphQL)<p>- Lambda + S3<p>- Mux<p>- Cube.js<p>- Stripe Connect &#x2F; Atlas<p>- Vue 2<p>Callum and I will be hanging out in the comments to answer any questions.

Nothing fancy, but just something helpful and makes me proud of.<p>If you are using a budgeting app already, what&#x27;s missing?<p>If you wish to use one, what sort of features would you look for?","time":1587136744,"title":"Ask HN: I'm building budgeting app. What features would you look for?","type":"story"},{"by":"loumal","dead":true,"id":22899714,"kids":[22899769,22900216],"score":17,"time":1587136480,"title":"I lived through the most toxic parts of 'Silicon Valley.'

moment in time when we see major upheaval in the world around us, we are reminded that technology, innovation, and progress are what characterise the modern economy. Whether for finding solutions to complex problems or improving outdated aspects of our lives and society, we are always looking at what is next to keep evolving and improving.\nAt dGen, we have just released our latest report. It examines the various considerations that need to be taken into account when thinking about launching a new Central Bank Digital Currency.\nIn this report, we examine the potential next step for one of the pillars of our economy — money itself. Central Bank Digital Currencies or CBDCs are a hot topic in reserve banks across the world. Around 80% of world banks are at least exploring the idea. A CBDC could be the next innovation in money and nobody wants to miss the boat.\nTwo events seem to have triggered much wider interest in the topic. The first being the announcement of Facebook’s Libra and other private stablecoins, which could one day be seen as a rival to reserve currencies; these were met with disdain from regulators far and wide. The second event was the announcement of the DCEP, or digital Yuan, that the Chinese Government is working on. Both of these likely led to heightened interest in the topic, as Western governments try to avoid any encroachment from other currency contenders.\nIt is not all smooth sailing for CBDCs, however. There are many technological, societal, and budgetary factors to overcome before a CBDC will rival a major currency. But there does seem to be a desire to explore and find solutions to this set of problems.\nAt dGen, we have focused on a case for the ‘Digital Euro’. Looking at the unique construct of the Eurozone, which presents its own nuanced challenges.

You can check it out here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zynq.io&#x2F;remote\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zynq.io&#x2F;remote</a><p>Both of us worked on G Suite and quit last year because we felt enterprise calendars really needed an upgrade and they weren’t a strategic priority for Google&#x2F;Microsoft. As a product manager, I spent a bunch of time organizing meetings and moving them around which was probably the least valuable thing I could have been doing. David, as an engineer, would frequently get interrupted by meetings people would schedule in the middle of his day when he was trying to get work done.<p>We built Zynq to make scheduling intuitive: just tell us who you want to meet &amp; how long you want your meeting to be and we’ll find the best time that works for everyone. Our algorithm looks for open slots during work hours where everyone is free in their timezone &amp; not out for lunch. We rank these slots via a scoring algorithm which prioritizes focus time for everyone invited &amp; picks the top slot.  We then create the meeting and automatically add a Zoom&#x2F;Hangouts link so you never need to set that up manually again.<p>We are launching this for free given the current WFH situation to help teams move faster, but we also have a separate paid product that optimizes for meeting room utilization and that’s how we make money.

HN,<p>Lately I&#x27;ve been thinking to move &quot;back&quot; to C to build tools for my own personal use (fun, curiosity, and the urge to go back to basic).<p>At the same time too, lately I noticed that there were resurgent of C discussions&#x2F;materials here and there. Not a lot, but there&#x27;s definitely something brewing, something shaping up in the corner of C world to make the experience less painful and more &quot;standardized&quot; as-per modern software development practice.<p>A background to describe my experience: your typical &quot;cloud&quot; software developer (Java, Go at the backend. Understand design-patterns, enterprise architecture patterns, clean code and the whole shebang. JS at the front-end. K8S + AWS as-needed base. Python for small stuff).<p>What I&#x27;d like to pursue on my free time: FreeBSD (or Linux). C as application-development to start with (think of GTK+, small CLI tools). Eventually, I might want to dig deep and build (or extend&#x2F;expand) infra-related software (think of network software, server software, system-level) but this is not the top priority.<p>If I want to start learning C today to satisfy the top goal: app-dev (GUI, Text-UI, CLI).

had an idea that came about after a dinner with an acquaintance, where he told me about the time he used to work as a professional chef. An interesting thing I picked up on was a decision making process that chefs go through by eyeballing some numbers and just going by their gut feeling. I thought the decisions could be made faster and more accurately if the users had an app that showed how their choices would affect their costs in real time. I even put together a small demo, and I think the recovery after the pandemic would be a good opportunity for restaurants to save costs by removing some inefficiencies.<p>The problems is I have no contacts in the business so I have no way of knowing what users actually need, and whether they would even be open to using insights from an app. Normally that would be the end of it, because I have zero experience in marketing to that sector. But I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a way for me to get in contact with people in the restaurant industry and see if they&#x27;d be interested.<p>Are there any strategies for making contacts in domains outside of your own?

For example: My first instinct based upon my work experience was a Docker container per bot, but from testing, as far as I can see I need a single instance which handles all servers if I want to use one developer &#x27;app&#x27; like Mee6 or Dyno.<p>Any hints&#x2F;links or similar welcome.","time":1586734745,"title":"Ask HN: How would you design a scalable chat bot for something like Discord?","type":"story"},{"by":"davidbarker","descendants":3,"id":22851745,"kids":[22851795,22851764,22852703],"score":6,"time":1586733223,"title":"Prospective employee turned down for job because his name is Jeffrey","type":"story","url":"https://twitter.com/yephph/status/1249246702126546944"},{"by":"gullyfur","descendants":4,"id":22851657,"kids":[22852109,22852137],"score":8,"time":1586732347,"title":"Rocket Engine Pulled from the Ocean Definitely Belonged to Apollo 11","type":"story","url":"https://www.wired.com/2013/07/bezos-apollo-11/"},{"by":"rfreytag","descendants":2,"id":22851487,"kids":[22851637,22851792],"score":4,"time":1586730615,"title":"Covid-19 Kills Renowned Mathematician John Conway","type":"story","url":"https://dailyvoice.com/new-jersey/mercer/obituaries/covid-19-kills-renowned-princeton-mathematician-game-of-life-inventor-john-conway-in-3-days/786461/"},{"by":"asamant","descendants":2,"id":22851478,"kids":[22851936,22852060,22852041],"score":42,"time":1586730518,"title":"How to Read a Paper [pdf]","type":"story","url":"https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf"},{"by":"jseliger","descendants":467,"id":22851622,"kids":[22851903,22852228,22851991,22851964,22851972,22852212,22853092,22852201,22853034,22852192,22852001,22852290,22853947,22853711,22852076,22853903,22852426,22852202,22854215,22852242,22852400,22852111,22852775,22852296,22852748,22852030,22851884,22855876,22853824,22855917,22853713,22853944,22853336,22851895,22851986,22852039,22854276,22852721,22852356,22853124,22852205,22855310,22852323,22852303],"score":337,"time":1586732014,"title":"New nuclear reactor designs promise safe, clean electricity","type":"story","url":"https://www.city-journal.org/next-generation-nuclear-power"},{"by":"pseudolus","descendants":4,"id":22851561,"kids":[22851893,22852309,22851890],"score":19,"time":1586731463,"title":"French pensioner ejected from fighter jet after accidentally grabbing handle","type":"story","url":"https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/04/09/frenchman_ejected_fighter_jet_retirement_jolly/"},{"by":"spir","descendants":3,"id":22851542,"kids":[22851606,22868232,22851830],"score":2,"text":"Archive.org&#x27;s Wayback machine has been broken for me for some months.<p>For example this page is broken https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;*&#x2F;www.kuon.ch&#x2F;post&#x2F;2020-03-08-hsluv&#x2F;","time":1586731339,"title":"Ask HN: What happened to Archive.org's Wayback machine?","type":"story"},{"by":"sashk","descendants":10,"id":22851167,"kids":[22851341,22851602,22854282],"score":75,"time":1586727349,"title":"BlockBlock 1.0.0 beta – rewritten and open source","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/objective-see/BlockBlock"},{"by":"akdas","descendants":4,"id":22851122,"kids":[22851148,22852217],"score":3,"time":1586726742,"title":"Scalability concepts: read-after-write consistency","type":"story","url":"https://avikdas.com/2020/04/13/scalability-concepts-read-after-write-consistency.html"},{"by":"samclemens","descendants":66,"id":22850976,"kids":[22852200,22853125,22851371,22851359,22851822,22852956,22851700,22853906,22851281,22851793,22851432,22854191,22851556,22853404,22851287],"score":68,"time":1586725013,"title":"“Mamma Desta” and Ethiopian food in the U.S","type":"story","url":"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2020/3/28/21195850/ethiopian-food-washington-dc-history-desta-bairu"},{"by":"elygre","descendants":2,"id":22850990,"kids":[22851159,22851171],"score":3,"text":"Like so many, I&#x27;m in isolation.

However, you can always start a side project, and that&#x27;s what I decided to do.<p>I opened GitHub, looked at my open source projects, and built a plan around monetizing Dracula, which is a dark theme for developers.<p>At first, this seemed like a crazy idea. Who would buy a color scheme for their code editors?<p>When you start, there are all these inner voices trying to stop you, but deep down, I knew I could build something meaningful.<p>In February 2020, I launched and... people started to buy. The feeling of receiving even $1 for your side project is unbelievable.<p>It&#x27;s really hard to explain. It opens your eyes to a different reality.<p>Two months later this side project already made $20,145.92.<p>If you&#x27;re considering creating a side project, stop waiting, and do it. Do it now. I mean it, close this page and start it right now.<p>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re not going to regret it a couple of months from now.<p>If you&#x27;re curious about this side project I created, you can check it out here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;draculatheme.com&#x2F;pro","time":1586703828,"title":"From $0 to $20,145.92 in 2 months with a side project","type":"story"},{"by":"jinjin2","descendants":14,"id":22848584,"kids":[22849497,22850695,22851464,22851140],"score":17,"time":1586702922,"title":"A possible solution to Covid-19, part 2: how would it work in practice","type":"story","url":"https://www.tillett.info/2020/04/12/how-would-a-search-for-a-natural-attenuated-sars-cov-2-strain-work-in-practice/"},{"by":"p17b","descendants":3,"id":22848506,"kids":[22848644,22848776,22864342],"score":3,"text":"I am having some major testicular pain which I believe is due to prolonged sitting in front of the computer and less movement due to quarantine.

some non-obvious trends that are rising right now:<p>1) Loungewear \nBecause of COVID-19, people are self-isolating at home and they are looking forward to donning their finest loungewear for another Netflix binge-watch session on the sofa. Loungewear had an increment of over 90% in search interest in the last days and it&#x27;s steadily growing.<p>2) Prepping \nPrepping often refers to the act of preparing yourself for life during and after an apocalyptic event. It has always been part of the survival niche, but now it&#x27;s getting more and more attention even from non-believers because of the coronavirus emergency.<p>3) Composting ️\nPeople are all about composting now. Why? \nMore and more cities are shutting down drop-off services because of the urgent steps required to bend the curve on coronavirus transmissions, like social distancing.<p>With more people at home, there&#x27;s also a growing interest in gardening, which is obviously related to composting.<p>4) Barbell weight set  ️\nWith more and more people at home, gym equipment is getting a ton of interest. Barbell weight set registered a +22% increment this month!\nAlso look keywords like weight plates, resistance bands, dumbells, home gym, no equipment workout, tonal, p90x, peloton. Aside from this, solitary fitness activities are also trending upward. For example, look at &quot;hiking&quot;.<p>5) Calming care \nIn the pet category, I would get in the game of selling everything anxiety related. For example, the demand for &quot;dog calming care&quot; has been growing steadily over the last 5 years. It could be related to separation anxiety, but also from fireworks anxiety.<p>You heard about these trends here first! =)<p>== \nShameless plug: We are adding 100s of new rising trends per day now on Treendly.<p>Check out more of them at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;treendly.com","time":1586689202,"title":"Interest in these topics is peaking","type":"story"},{"by":"jxub","descendants":223,"id":22847342,"kids":[22847786,22847750,22847858,22847705,22847794,22848052,22847939,22848094,22847785,22847713,22848133,22848241,22849048,22847923,22848385,22848164,22847911,22847856,22848824,22847872,22847972,22865534,22847811,22847734,22847710,22847680,22848030,22847876,22848202],"score":195,"time":1586689094,"title":"You're a Slave to Money, Then You Die","type":"story","url":"https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/youre-a-slave-to-money-then-you-die/"},{"by":"jkaljundi","descendants":1,"id":22847332,"kids":[22848459,22849931],"score":10,"time":1586688973,"title":"Was Leisure Suit Larry an Accomplice in Early Banking Cyberattacks?","type":"story","url":"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/epg9be/did-sierra-create-leisure-suit-larry-virus-stop-piracy"},{"by":"doener","descendants":4,"id":22847311,"kids":[22848752,22851411],"score":26,"time":1586688682,"title":"Bootstrap, a UI framework used by 20% of internet sites, is dropping IE support","type":"story","url":"https://www.zdnet.com/article/bootstrap-a-ui-framework-used-by-20-of-internet-sites-is-dropping-ie-support/"},{"by":"jrepinc","descendants":108,"id":22847210,"kids":[22847492,22847483,22847353,22847507,22847305,22847448,22847452,22847477,22847331,22847303,22847532,22847416,22847304,22847321,22847549,22847426,22847333,22847673,22847607,22847499,22847310,22847466,22847569,22847976,22847349,22847575,22847418,22847495,22848283,22847468,22847633,22847312,22847570],"score":183,"time":1586687332,"title":"Stop the Apple and Google contact tracing platform","type":"story","url":"https://blog.xot.nl/2020/04/11/stop-the-apple-and-google-contact-tracing-platform-or-be-ready-to-ditch-your-smartphone/"},{"by":"miked85","descendants":4,"id":22847116,"kids":[22847977,22847899,22848040],"score":25,"time":1586685945,"title":"Mozilla Installs Scheduled Telemetry Task on Windows with Firefox 75","type":"story","url":"https://www.ghacks.net/2020/04/09/mozilla-installs-scheduled-telemetry-task-on-windows-with-firefox-75/"},{"by":"petecooper","descendants":12,"id":22847089,"kids":[22847840,22847865,22848167,22849722,22855857,22850604,22848622],"score":44,"text":"I&#x27;m coming out of an extended spell of mental fog, and I would like to investigate self-administered cognitive behaviour therapy as part of my recovery and treatment.

Over the last 6 months, I&#x27;ve been trying to land a new job, however, it&#x27;s been surprisingly tough. I&#x27;ve interviewed at several companies (FAANG, some startups, and everything in between) and the technical rounds have always gone well (with the exception of Google which was particularly hard!). However I&#x27;ve somehow managed to fail at every single behavioral interview.<p>Part of that is that I haven&#x27;t done much to talk about. I&#x27;ve done fairly standard work for the last few years: completed what was asked of me, but haven&#x27;t sought any challenging work. No side projects either. I never thought that would be an impediment to my career. For now, it&#x27;s still okay—I have a stable, well paying job, but I can see this becoming more of an issue in the years to come.<p>I&#x27;d like to know what I could be doing better, what interviewers expect from a behavioral round, how I should approach my work.

So another desperation post. Few people have written me in past but I lost all messages&#x2F;contacts as I seem to have deleted the accounts content. I want a life...a future...but I am simply not able to do it alone. Timing of world events makes it even worse I know. Please if you have the energy reach out. Email is in profile.

Art in Res is an online marketplace where painters sell their art directly to buyers, instead of needing to work with an art gallery.<p>I studied art and moved to New York in 2008 dreaming of making it as an artist. It wasn’t easy. I lived in a maybe-legal warehouse space that doubled as a poorly-ventilated art studio. My first day job was stocking shelves at Trader Joe’s, which covered my rent and groceries but, at New York prices, not much else.<p>My best friend in NYC had a side hustle making artist websites by hacking them out on top of WordPress. He was great at it. Through that side-hustle, he got approached to make an online store for a small business. Shopify wasn’t wasn’t widely known back then and he needed help. So he proposed to me: “Hey John, I know you have a nerdy side. Do you think you could learn to program and we could make the website together?” I told him “No way! That’s crazy! It would take me years to learn to program!” But he said “Look, there’s this new thing called Ruby on Rails. At least just Google that before you say ‘no’”. So I did a Rails tutorial and thought “Hmm, maybe I _could_ do this.” We accepted the gig and I’ve been a happy coder ever since. (We did _not_ ship the site on time.)<p>I’m all in on coding now, but most of my artist friends are still making art, and still working day jobs. Their studios are full of amazing paintings that barely anyone gets to see. And for every one of my friends there are a thousand other artists out there, cranking out amazing work and not selling it because they don’t have galleries selling it for them.<p>A couple years ago, my cofounder John (we’re both named John) told me that he had bought a painting from an artist he’d met. He couldn’t believe how great the paintings were, how cool the artist was, how the artists’ studio was this cool warehouse space that was overflowing with unsold paintings. He knew me as a programmer – but wasn’t I a painter before that? He had the idea that we could put our experiences together and make a website where people could buy art from all the amazing but not-famous artists around them.<p>We started Art in Res as a nights-and-weekends project. We found lots of people who liked the idea of buying art – but we also realized that most people who aren’t hardcore art collectors think that paying over $100 for a painting is hard to swallow. The thing is though, that paintings are made by hand, often painstakingly over long periods of time, and so they don’t benefit from the economics of scale that create the prices that modern consumers expect.<p>We resolve that by having our buyers purchase art on _installment plans_, where each payment results in a payment to the artist. In normal circumstances, revenue for artists tends to be spiky and unpredictable. Once an artist on Art in Res gets a couple installment plans going, they have a nice, predictable revenue stream. And a buyer who is purchasing this way gets to live with a unique, hand-made painting for ~$30-60 per month. It works really well for both parties.<p>We’re working on Art in Res full-time now and our team has grown to 5 people (all creatives in some capacity or another.) We’re John, Dan, Noni, Emily and me. We think art should be affordable and artists should get paid. There’s so much amazing art out there, collecting dust in studios. It deserves to find loving homes. &lt;3<p>Thanks so much, and we can’t wait to hear your thoughts!<p>–<p>PS - I’ve been lurking HN for close to a decade and this is thrilling for me!","time":1586451537,"title":"Launch HN: Art in Res (YC W20) – Buy art directly from artists","type":"story"},{"by":"sakofchit","descendants":16,"id":22824525,"kids":[22824528,22830049,22828030,22827306,22829982],"score":50,"time":1586451181,"title":"Show HN: Funderbuddy – Apply for multiple grants with 1 application","type":"story","url":"https://funderbuddy.net"},{"by":"rurp","descendants":4,"id":22824341,"kids":[22824420,22824653],"score":4,"time":1586450359,"title":"Yelp cutting 1k jobs, furloughing others","type":"story","url":"https://www.axios.com/yelp-cutting-1000-jobs-furloughing-others-0ebcba5e-598d-47cf-92ac-a1d552e6814d.html"},{"by":"zzaner","descendants":51,"id":22824198,"kids":[22824549,22824631,22824670,22824891,22824526,22824824,22824547,22824337,22824555,22824609,22824783,22824832,22824637,22824255,22824896],"score":38,"time":1586449806,"title":"Zoom Is Not the Problem – Our Meeting-Centric Workflow Is","type":"story","url":"https://blog.nuclino.com/zoom-is-not-the-problem-our-meeting-centric-workflow-is"},{"by":"vernondegoede1","descendants":5,"id":22824040,"kids":[22827507,22830352,22829797,22825455,22826555],"score":4,"text":"I’m working at a financial company that has 80K+ active clients throughout Europe.

You can search by product type, tech stack, team culture, remote-friendliness or perks — no need to sign up. If you’d like, you can answer a short questionnaire and get matched with the best engineering teams.

I&#x27;m Mike, co-founder at Zapier and head of Zapier Labs. Today our Labs team is launching a public version of Zappy (download it here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zapier.com&#x2F;zappy): a fast, free screen capture tool that we built for our remote team.<p>At Zapier, we have 300+ teammates working from across the globe with no central office—we&#x27;ve been fully remote since day one. We&#x27;ve learned that increasing communication bandwidth is crucial when you&#x27;re working remotely.<p>We wanted a tool for screenshots&#x2F;GIFs to supplement apps like Slack, but nothing on the market had the mix of speed and features we were looking for. So, we built it ourselves. Zappy is a cornerstone of how we work at Zapier, nearly everyone at Zapier uses Zappy every week (voluntarily)! And we want to share it.<p>Why now? People around the world just experienced a sudden shift to remote work—and we know life sans-office comes with unique challenges. We want to share our experience and make that transition a little easier.<p>Our goal with Zappy was to provide a screen capture experience that was so fast, people would actually want to use it to communicate. To capture something, you hit a keyboard shortcut, draw a square, and press enter. Zappy copies the image to your clipboard so you can paste it anywhere (or provides a path to your GIF&#x2F;video).<p>You can draw annotations, record a selfie view, and stitch shots together. Captures support image, GIF, and MP4 formats.

We wanted to create Paragon to make it easier to build and manage some of these services without being an expert backend engineer.<p>Paragon is a visual workflow builder that provides &quot;steps&quot; like API requests, database queries, and conditional logic that you can drag and drop to build microservices or integrations. Many workflows can be built without writing code, but we also provide Cloud Functions as a native step type in case you need to add some custom logic to your workflow. You can deploy workflows in one click and visualize the flow of data through each execution for easy debugging.<p>Today, we&#x27;re focused on helping build integrations between your product and 3rd party APIs. We know there is a history of visual programming tools that promise more than they deliver. Paragon isn&#x27;t designed to build your core product or replace your API, but we do hope to make it easier to extend functionality and microservices that integrate your product with other services (especially if you&#x27;re not a backend engineer).<p>For example, our users have built workflows that sends weekly Twilio messages to their Firebase users, or that parses user file uploads via an OCR API and saves them to MongoDB. Here&#x27;s an example workflow that finds your inactive users in Postgres and sends them re-engagement messages with Twilio or Sendgrid: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=UVU8GCBMZj4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=UVU8GCBMZj4</a><p>We launched Paragon in beta about a month ago and we charge a monthly subscription based on usage, starting at $30 for 1,000 tasks per month. If you&#x27;re interested in trying Paragon, you can sign up on our website and and I&#x27;ll fast-track you to the top of our waitlist!<p>We&#x27;d love to hear your experience building API integrations. Thanks, and looking forwards to your thoughts and feedback in the comments!<p>Edit: We don&#x27;t currently offer a free tier or trial. The reason is that we currently provide custom onboarding for every user where we help setup your workflow(s) over a Zoom call, then add you a Slack channel where we provide realtime support. We invest a lot of time and effort to ensure each user is successful and are happy to offer a full refund if we can&#x27;t. That said, we do plan to add some free version of Paragon in the future. I hope this clarifies some people&#x27;s comments about our pricing, thanks!","time":1586360056,"title":"Launch HN: Paragon (YC W20) – Visually Build API Workflows","type":"story"},{"by":"giantg2","descendants":2,"id":22813833,"kids":[22819962,22814022],"score":1,"text":"Chipdrop let&#x27;s landscapers deliver their wood chips to individuals for free.

I wanted an easy way to share complex configurations. At the moment most docker compose package management is done by adding a docker-compose.yml to your repo, adding a bunch of setup instructions, and hoping they are well followed. This didn&#x27;t feel like a smart way to go about it to me.<p>I wanted to create a way to create a complex package, say a series of related or linked services, and provide some meaningful way to have users install it. That&#x27;s why I built DCPM. It provides a few things for you:<p><pre><code>  1. A nice CLI to interact with\n  2. A place to store these files and configuration\n  3. A way to setup new projects that&#x27;s not just reading a readme\n</code></pre>\nTo achieve these goals I built the @dcpm&#x2F;cli and blobs.dcpm.dev. The cli allows you to upload and download blobs, and the back end allows you to have a persistent storage to use. I&#x27;ve also built a really simple front end for searching packages.<p>This is a very early alpha. There is a lot left to improve, but I feel enough of the core concepts are here to get some early feedback and improve the tool. Any and all feedback are super welcome.

We’re Erika and Arnelle, friends since high school and co-founders of Edlyft (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.edlyft.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.edlyft.com</a>). We help college students pass their most challenging computer science classes, by offering them group tutoring sessions, study groups, and guidance from peers who’ve done it before them.<p>Arnelle and I came into college as freshmen not knowing how to code, but wanting to graduate with a CS degree. We found the steep learning curve discouraging, the lack of support frustrating, and felt like everyone else was always ahead. Impostor syndrome hit hard. But we made it through! In the end, what made the difference was connecting with students and mentors who had come before us. My junior year out of desperation, I wrote a letter to a grad student who was willing to meet with me weekly to review concepts and connect me with other CS students.  Without that support system, I probably would&#x27;ve been weeded out from the CS major and not here writing this launch today.<p>Despite almost being weeded out, Arnelle and I were fortunate enough to land internships and jobs at fine tech companies. However we kept thinking about all the talented people who could and should be succeeding and don&#x27;t have access to the same tools that we did. If they&#x27;d had the same kind of support that we were able to create for ourselves, they could’ve not dropped CS and maybe pursued their dream job in tech. Finally we decided to quit our jobs to build the support program that can make this difference.<p>If you got into programming before college and&#x2F;or grew up in an environment where you were encouraged to play with tech, it may be hard to appreciate what an enormous head start that is. For many people who didn&#x27;t take that path before college, there&#x27;s a huge culture shock in the beginning to learn the basics of computing. It&#x27;s all too easy to get discouraged and think that you don&#x27;t have what it takes, and the sink-or-swim culture of academia unfortunately encourages these outcomes. Just having access to someone who was once in your position and knows that you can do it--because they did it--can be a game changer, especially in STEM.<p>You might be wondering why universities don&#x27;t provide this already. That&#x27;s what we ourselves wondered while we were going through the experience. For a while, we were fighting within the departments to get more support implemented. But it turns out that the incentives just aren&#x27;t there. Colleges mostly aren&#x27;t incentivized to increase CS enrollment, as Professors want to focus on their research and budgets are tight. Instead schools cap the major and struggle to increase support as demand goes up. Students wait for hours in line at office hours to get help--sometimes as long as 6 hours. At Cal, almost half of students who take the intro CS class will not receive a qualifying grade for the major. For universities, this is just an attrition number, but we know that much of that so-called attrition is people who have every ability to succeed at the material but need the right kind of orientation and support. Given the incredible value and growing importance of CS in our economy, this is not a minor difference in outcome. This is a broken system that we’re determined to solve.<p>Once a student joins Edlyft, they are immediately connected to a group of students in their CS class and an older student mentor from their school who has aced the class before. We hire compassionate and patient student mentors who host weekly group tutoring sessions and on-call q&amp;a hours. Every Edlyft student gains access to up to 6 more hours of CS help per week and becomes a part of a larger community of CS students. They answer each other’s questions over Slack, work together over Zoom, and rely on our growing school-specific playbooks that are kept up to date by the student mentors. This is the supportive ecosystem we wish we had.<p>We’re currently launched at UC Berkeley, UCLA, and UC Santa Cruz. But the vision does not stop there; We plan to expand to other schools beyond California as fast as is sustainable and see a clear path to expanding into all high growth STEM fields, like Data Science and Pre-Med. We charge a monthly subscription for students to join, and offer need-based financial aid to ensure Edlyft is accessible and inclusive. Our hope is that the students who succeed through this program will become mentors to the ones who are coming up later, and make some money in the process.<p>If you have any memories struggling with Computer Science, please share them below! Although many people on HN were programming from an early age, we also know that there many who came late to computing and have done very well for themselves. We’d love to hear your stories and share them with our students to remind them that it’s normal for CS to be challenging and they’re not the only one.<p>Most importantly, if you know a college student struggling through CS, encourage them to find a mentor who can guide them through. And put them in touch with us! We’d love to talk to them.<p>We’re excited to hear your thoughts on how we can make computer science better for college students!","time":1586279640,"title":"Launch HN: Edlyft (YC W20) – Paid Support Program for CS College Students","type":"story"},{"by":"jdblair","descendants":99,"id":22805045,"kids":[22805496,22805883,22805294,22806353,22809155,22805984,22805872,22805463,22805768,22806011,22805702,22805956,22805741],"score":47,"time":1586278854,"title":"Is Covid-19 a Geopolitical Game-Changer?","type":"story","url":"https://www.institutmontaigne.org/en/blog/covid-19-geopolitical-game-changer"},{"by":"zxienin","descendants":53,"id":22804864,"kids":[22806136,22805012,22805367,22806608,22806007,22810408,22805675,22807229,22805236],"score":92,"time":1586278053,"title":"SAP Graph: API Sandbox on preview","type":"story","url":"https://beta.graph.sap"},{"by":"luxpir","descendants":52,"id":22804804,"kids":[22805489,22808355,22805925,22805083,22805979,22806451,22805170,22805252,22805522,22805033,22806966,22809081,22805431],"score":98,"time":1586277776,"title":"Share your desktop as a webcam in OBS, Hangouts, Zoom etc.","type":"story","url":"https://lukespear.co.uk/blog/share-desktop-as-webcam-in-obs-loopback/"},{"by":"spking","descendants":161,"id":22804608,"kids":[22804822,22804941,22804836,22805059,22804880,22804743,22805067,22807997,22805005,22805282,22804927,22804987,22810297,22805027,22804749,22804898,22805078,22805096],"score":85,"time":1586276502,"title":"U.S. airlines want a $50B bailout.

People are fascinated by celebrities’ lives of glamour, infact celebrities are actually worshipped here. Like Rajnikanth, a south superstar, has over 30 temples to his name. Employees are literally given holiday on his movie release day. These celebrities are respectful of this culture and are always looking to give back to their fan base.<p>India has been leading in content consumption and creation on social media, platforms like Tik Tok are doubling MAU every year. The craze for content, the fan culture and the ease of digital payments make it an exciting opportunity for the indian audience to actually interact with their favourite celebrities that all of this while has been a dream for them.<p>About the team: Divyanshu is an influencer with over 200k followers and a keynote speaker. I&#x27;m a second time founder with a tech background having scaled my previous venture Fleapo to 3 countries. We have a strong team, having hired from the leading institutions of the country like the IIMs. We shifted the startup from Kolkata to Mumbai with the entire team prior to YC for better opportunities of growth at bootstrapped stage and scaled the startup from a home office in Mumbai.<p>TagMango started as an influencer marketplace where we worked with some of the biggest brands like Hershey’s, ITC, Meesho, etc and worked with 80K+ influencers.

changes. However, I see a continuity in the way we react to them. The measures we take to counter the unknown might be small or unprecedented depending on the novelty and severity, but we seem to follow a pattern.<p>Step 1: Encounter an unknown situation\nStep 2: Analyse whether we have remotely been into some similar situation.\nStep 3: If yes: then try to use it as a point of reference to tackle this new situation. Then go to Step 5\nStep 4: If no: Take some unprecedented measure never seen before. Then go to Step 5.\nStep 5: Learn from the outcomes and improve on the solution. \nStep 6: Take measures to ensure we are prepared similar scenarios in the future. \nStep 7: Change old regulations or introduce new ones to proactively thwart any such occurrences in the future.<p>We can notice this pattern throughout our history. 9&#x2F;11, SARS, COVID-19, World Wars, Cold-War, Tsunami, Chernobyl, the British colonization of India or Lehman Brothers. The way we have responded would conform to the above algorithm.<p>The problem though is that it gives us a false sense of preparedness. Say there was a burglary at my house. What would I do? I would report it to the authorities, enhance my security, put up a better lock, put up some security cameras. All my neighbours would have learnt their lessons and the authorities would become more vigilant as well. We all are ready to handle any burglar now, aren&#x27;t we?

currently evaluating Python frameworks for a new project. I&#x27;ve built a number of applications with Flask &#x2F; Django over the years, but also recently discovered FastAPI, which is built on Starlette. I tried it out for a small hobby app locally and enjoyed the experience so far. I liked how you could define types with Pydantic, the dependency injection, and how it seemed a little easier to bootstrap and form a project structure  vs. flask. The auto API docs are great as well.

HN,<p>Pablo and Oriol here, founders of Belvo (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;belvo.co&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;belvo.co&#x2F;</a>), a financial data API platform for Latin America. Think Plaid for Latam.<p>We were previously building a payments startup (something like Venmo) in Europe and when expanding to Latam realised how hard it is to connect to legacy infrastructure, whether it is to access data, validate bank accounts or process payments. We’ve also been working in fintech in Europe for the past few years (at companies like Revolut) and one of us comes from a traditional financial services background. We’ve seen the impact open banking technology, which has become common in Europe, has had on providing end-users with more transparent\nand fair offerings and on lowering barriers for fintech developers to get started and launch innovative new products. But this technology hasn&#x27;t made it into Latam yet, so we saw a big opportunity and started Belvo to solve that.<p>Belvo allows end-users to connect their financial data to new fintech apps across Latam. We’ve seen a number of relevant use cases for our product so far. For personal and business finance apps, we allow users to connect bank accounts and view them in one place through account consolidation. This allows developers to provide better spending analytics and proactive recommendations. Business-oriented finance apps can reduce manual errors and costs via automated accounting by syncing bank feeds and reconciling transactions on a recurring basis. We’ve also seen that digital-first banks and wallets can use us to build in-house personal finance managers and authenticate the owner of any bank account - thus streamlining their know-your-client (KYC) processes. We also enable credit providers to build better and faster experiences for borrowers. Instead of having to build onboarding flows or asking users to self-report or upload their information, data can be synced via our API. Fraud risk can also be reduced and scoring improved by accessing more granular and broad data.<p>Currently we allow end-users to connect banks and bank-like sources to fintech apps. That being said, our goal is to aggregate all relevant financial data sources, not just banks. This is particularly important in Latam, where 50% of the population is unbanked. In this context, sources such as service providers (think prepaid phone, prepaid TV, electricity bills), digital wallets and gig-economy apps are relevant for both users and fintech apps. These are typically paid in cash and don’t go through a bank statement or debit card but all have portals where consumption and spend can be analysed and categorised. Becoming the “source of truth” for all this data is pretty tricky as all data sources have different formats, ways to access, granularity, etc. and that’s something we’re looking to solve.<p>The process of connecting accounts to fintech apps is built on the premise of full and strong user consent to data sharing. Security &#x2F; privacy is something we’ve been focusing on since day 1. Our engineering, infrastructure and data teams have past experience in working on products with similar complexities.<p>We went live in January in Mexico, our first market. We will soon be expanding to Colombia and Brazil and working on some additional products and sources to complement the core data API.<p>Belvo has been built by developers, for developers and our API documentation is public. The way to get setup is directly via our developer portal (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.belvo.co&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.belvo.co&#x2F;</a>). Upon signup, you’ll be able to retrieve your API keys for both our Sandbox and Production environments.<p>Oriol and I would be delighted to get your thoughts and feedback on what we’re building.<p>Fire away HN!","time":1585926675,"title":"Launch HN: Belvo (YC W20) – Financial Data API Platform for Latin America","type":"story"},{"by":"oltdaniel","descendants":72,"id":22769926,"kids":[22770236,22770295,22770434,22770455,22770226,22770372,22770827,22770677,22770728,22770696,22770541,22770350,22770417,22770757,22770751,22771348],"score":25,"time":1585926361,"title":"Money Horror","type":"story","url":"https://oltdaniel.at/2020/money-horror.html"},{"by":"proberts","descendants":309,"id":22769789,"kids":[22770067,22772682,22773385,22771664,22774724,22775622,22772791,22773204,22771362,22773234,22772630,22769951,22771269,22771907,22773353,22769985,22770026,22771592,22769903,22773055,22771890,22776226,22774338,22772553,22769944,22771094,22771312,22771628,22771373,22775169,22775962,22771993,22772924,22770502,22774563,22773989,22773166,22771305,22771996,22771265,22770387,22771402,22770808,22771292,22771953,22771051,22776105,22772396,22771270,22770250,22773039,22772631,22773099,22772220,22777225,22775780,22777348,22770297,22773162,22771824,22772829,22772686,22771888,22770428,22771873,22771780,22772866,22771317,22774687,22770459,22771346,22773313,22770410,22770221,22771596,22770198,22772550,22775797,22773667,22770762,22770182,22771560,22772400,22771926,22769992,22774876,22771864,22772702,22771874,22769950,22771781,22772509,22771590,22770038,22773883,22771797,22772754,22771263,22771253,22771179,22771470,22770161,22777812,22769853,22770154,22772642,22769964,22770342,22772688,22772621,22771255,22772689,22769972,22772250,22772274,22775678,22772338,22772249,22772741,22771347,22772232,22775149,22772707,22769886,22773263,22770481,22770458,22770674,22770022,22769922,22770475,22771041],"score":216,"text":"It&#x27;s 6 months since the last thread, so time for another.

I&#x27;ve even heard stories about people having to use the same N95 masks for days on end. I am not really sure how much this will help. I had an idea that I built over the weekend after reading about the death of 26 year old Dr. Usama Riaz, which was a result of treating people with Covid-19 despite not having any form or PPE. I thought there must be a cheaper solution where his face could have been covered, and some solution for using a filter that could be easily sanitized and reused. It&#x27;s heartbreaking that such a selfless person had to die so young. Perhaps if I could have gotten this out there sooner, as it would have been better than the nothing Dr. Riaz was using.<p>His story inspired me to design something I call the Filter Adapted Snorkel Tube (F.A.S.T) Mask. I am by no means a an expert in the medical device space, but rather just a nerd with 3D printer, ideas a plenty, some talents, and time to spare. The design objectives I hoped to achieve for this project were:<p><pre><code>    1. Protect users&#x27; entire face.\n    2. Keep the filter as isolated and clean as possible. (No facial oil contamination and mitigate direct body fluid exposure.)\n    3. No tooling required. KISS!\n    4. Easy sterilization.\n    5. Reusability.\n    6. Parts must be easily acquirable globally.\n    7. Provide a consistent seal between the filter and filter holder.\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;d love any feedback and&#x2F;or improvement suggestions. I have some other ideas I&#x27;ve been kicking around like adding a HEPA filter mod, since there seems to be an abundance of HEPA filters available that can filter at 0.3 microns. I actually ordered one off Amazon today, and I should be able to have a proof of concept ready by Sunday or Monday.<p>Here&#x27;s a link to the project:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;magnetic-pi&#x2F;fast-mask<p>Stay safe out there everyone!","time":1585869310,"title":"F.A.S.T Mask","type":"story"},{"by":"cristoperb","descendants":42,"id":22764811,"kids":[22765567,22767969,22764900,22765016,22767246,22765645,22766779,22766662,22765085,22766446,22767701],"score":480,"time":1585868933,"title":"A crash course in compilers (2018)","type":"story","url":"https://increment.com/programming-languages/crash-course-in-compilers/"},{"by":"jacobedawson","descendants":304,"id":22764824,"kids":[22766347,22766455,22766302,22769644,22766536,22766424,22767672,22769046,22769282,22768207,22769328,22768695,22774277,22779418,22767875,22767421,22768169,22767904,22766613,22767784,22767019,22768306,22767558,22766264,22767153,22767052,22778057,22770365,22765733,22766699,22766532,22766588,22766190,22766826,22766617,22766428,22766693,22766193],"score":190,"time":1585869030,"title":"Reiki can’t possibly work, so why does it?","type":"story","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/04/reiki-cant-possibly-work-so-why-does-it/606808/"},{"by":"DocSavage","descendants":11,"id":22764673,"kids":[22765134,22765163,22765344,22766570,22765392,22765242,22765215],"score":33,"time":1585867717,"title":"What humans would look like if we could survive car wrecks (2016)","type":"story","url":"http://www.popsci.com/this-is-what-humans-would-look-like-if-we-could-withstand-car-wrecks"},{"by":"lordmax","descendants":5,"id":22764669,"kids":[22765690,22764701,22771350,22765362],"score":6,"time":1585867692,"title":"Privacy-focused Brave browser added 1M new users in March – The Block","type":"story","url":"https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/60705/privacy-focused-brave-browser-added-1m-new-users-in-march"},{"by":"jaaron","descendants":3,"id":22764666,"kids":[22764691,22768066],"score":11,"time":1585867651,"title":"The Java Posse: Rest in Peace Carl Quinn.

What can be a solution to this problem? Is it justified to shutdown internet <i>in times of social unrest</i>?<p>Today I came across a very disturbing news of health workers being attacked while they visited a suspected Covid-19 infected patients house in India (and many other countries). The cause of attack has been attributed to misinformation being spread on a Whatsapp group. This news is not a one off incidence of Internet services leading to a social unrest.<p>As a solution, often Indian government lean to shutdown the internet in such places during riots, or any kind of social unrest. Indian government did the same in Kashmir recently as a per-emptive measure in 2019. This was criticized and our Supreme court went on to say Internet is a fundamental right.<p>So here lies my dilemma. On one hand Internet - which of course includes Facebook, Insta, whatsapp, Signal etc services - is very important and considered as a fundamental right, but it is also causing harm to the society. How can such problem be solved, which from my vantage point is becoming more frequent? Can it be justified to shutdown internet or censor internet <i>during crisis</i>? If not, then how to tackle this problem from a governance point of view when you know the cause from where the\nproblem is arising.<p>I am giving examples from India, but this problem is becoming very global according to me, and would like to hear your views from a global perspective, is there some country handling this in a better way? And I humbly request, please do not indulge in any political arguments.<p>[1]

attempted to solve below DNS related privacy challenges and realized that setting up necessary tools was pretty time consuming and complex.<p>Challenges:<p>1. Private DNS server for my home network and for my devices when they are on the move away from Home network.\n2. Ability to block all ads, maleware etc inside my browser and mobile apps that I use. No need for adblock plugins in browser or ad blocking VPN service configuration.\n3. Avoid use of DoH client for home devices.<p>I came up with simple docker based DNS server with DoH capability that can be setup easily in minutes. I wanted to make sure that I can rebuild my DNS server quickly without redoing all complex installation and configuration and make it easy for others to use same stack effortlessly.<p>I have setup DNS server with DoH + Unbound on a raspberry pi at home (You can use any linux box&#x2F;VM if raspberry pi is not available). I use it as my DNS server in router DHCP settings. This setup solves all my DNS related privacy challenges. This allows me to use native DNS + DoH for home network. I blocked 53 port traffic at router for all IPs except my raspberry pi IP. This makes sure none of the devices on network can communicate over DNS ports outside of my network except raspberry pi running DNS server.<p>When I am on the move away from my home setup, I use DoH service installed on a DNS server that I setup in cloud with same docker stack (AWS EC2 micro instance). AWS provides all new accounts a 12 months of free usage for t1.micro instance. This cloud DNS server with DoH keeps me protected from ads, maleware etc and ISP even outside of my house.

We built a platform that helps influencers launch their own custom line of products. By &#x27;influencers&#x27; we mean creators who have loyal and engaged audiences on social media that they have grown through their own content. They are usually experts in a particular skill, like cookie decorating, vegan baking, or fitness and nutrition. Right now the primary way they make money is through promoting third party brands in their content. While they have all the necessary creative skills to connect with a large audience they do not have expertise in product design, tech, and operations to launch and sell their own products. We help these talented individuals launch their own e-commerce brand and start turning their fans into customers. We take care of everything for them -- from product design and tech to operations and delivery -- so influencers can create and start selling their physical and virtual products in a matter of days.<p>Ankita and I met in 2014, while she was completing her MBA at NYU Stern and I was working at The Food Network. Ankita came from an engineering background and had previously worked at Apple, while my experience was in media production, but we connected immediately and started working on a few projects together at the intersection of food and tech and launched our own DTC food brand that would feature products to help people cook more global cuisines at home, hence the name Global Belly.<p>We developed our own e-commerce platform with all the bells and whistles, set up operations with co-packers and food distributors, and even started working with a fulfillment partner to manage delivery logistics. When we began exploring influencer partnerships, we started hearing the same thing from all of them: “I’ve always wanted to launch my own line of products like these but I just don’t have the time and resources”. This really resonated with us, we knew first-hand the challenges of launching your own brand, and we knew this would be nearly impossible for them while maintaining aggressive content calendars. After speaking with 100 different food influencers we learnt not only how well-positioned they were to launch their own products but how eager they were to do it. The solution became obvious to us, we had the tech, analytics and operational expertise to help them launch both physical and virtual product lines quickly. Influencers could continue to do what they do best, create amazing content and connect with their audience and we would take care of the rest for them.<p>So this is how it works: Once influencers are onboarded we look at their audience data and help them create a product portfolio that is best suited for their fans. We design all of these products, set up their custom store on Global Belly and manage the production and fulfillment logistics of the whole store as well. Influencers share their custom products to their fans and followers via their store on Global Belly and they start earning revenue for each product sold from day 1.<p>We have currently launched 17 influencers in the food vertical and shipped thousands of products so far. One of our largest influencers is SweetAmbs, who is a pastry chef specializing in cookie decorating. Through her beautifully crafted videos she has built an audience of 3M across her social media platforms. We helped her launch her own line of DIY cookie kits, signature cookie mixes, books, and e-tutorials via her Global Belly store (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;globalbelly.com&#x2F;collections&#x2F;sweetambs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;globalbelly.com&#x2F;collections&#x2F;sweetambs</a>) She is just one of the millions of content creators we believe will be the future of commerce as they begin to capitalize on their own brand instead of pushing others.<p>Though the majority of our launches have been in the last 3 months, we have already started learning some interesting things. The size of the influencers&#x27; audience is only one parameter to watch, as smaller influencers have proven that they can be just as successful as larger ones. An influencer with only 100K in followers can generate the same product revenue in the first week of launch than one with over 500K. We are starting to collect data on how much an influencer can actually sell to predict revenue they can generate based on audience parameters like age, gender, income and education.<p>While we are the only company doing this in the food space at the moment, this model has seen success in the fashion and beauty industry. Would love to connect with anyone at Revolve and Huda Beauty and anyone with extensive knowledge or a unique perspective in the social commerce space. We are looking forward to hearing ideas and feedback from the HN community and any experiences you have in this space!","time":1585752893,"title":"Launch HN: Global Belly (YC W20) – Helping influencers launch their own products","type":"story"},{"by":"mingabunga","descendants":2,"id":22749216,"kids":[22749288,22749468],"score":2,"text":"As a software developer we have a lot of affiliates who own coupon websites.

We build software to automate the creation of construction blueprints. Specifically, our software generates engineering blueprints for air conditioning, ducting, fire, electrical, and plumbing services over the floor plan of the building. MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing) designs are a set of 15 technical drawings. We got started in India and are currently operating there, but MEP is standard enough that the software can apply to Western markets also, given that we have incorporated international building codes.<p>Architects and contractors hire consultants, who still design the building manually. Complete dependence on human effort results in a process that is slow, error-prone and unreliable. Also, the number of consultants is limited resulting in higher fees, long delivery times and difficulty accessing the services.<p>Rushil started practicing architecture and had troubles dealing with the available MEP firms for his own projects. Naman built an optimization software for the Indian Railways. We’ve been friends for 13 years, and often discuss our problems and achievements. Naman hacked a prototype for plumbing drainage plans that worked perfectly over Rushil’s project, and got us excited about the possibility of such a software.<p>Our software takes in the floor plan as the input, understands the building and designs the MEP services like an engineer would. A month of engineer’s work gets cut down to a day. We require artificial intelligence algorithms to decipher the floor plan, constraint modelling techniques to encode building codes, routing methods to create pipe paths and optimization algorithms to minimize material wastage.<p>The software even calculates bill of materials with project cost estimates. It is important to note that MEP accounts for 25% of all project costs! Since the quantity of materials is huge, selecting the right items and vendors is a challenge in an unorganized sector like construction. We recommend what products to install and which brands to choose, as per geographic locations and availability.<p>The input to our software is the building’s floor plan. The floor plan gives us complete data of the building, with which we can do a lot more. We can generate structural blueprints, 3D models, and create interior design renders!<p>We&#x27;re eager to hear feedback and answer questions. Do share your experiences from the construction industry, and your opinion on the use of software to make construction work more efficient.","time":1585649486,"title":"Launch HN: PillarPlus (YC W20) – Automatically create construction blueprints","type":"story"},{"by":"tyrion","descendants":19,"id":22736124,"kids":[22748161,22748873,22750019,22748337,22747776],"score":61,"time":1585647900,"title":"A letter to myself as a fresh software engineer","type":"story","url":"https://www.florio.dev/20200328-letter-to-myself/"},{"by":"gjvc","descendants":4,"id":22736057,"kids":[22736110,22736116,22736119],"score":1,"time":1585646938,"title":"Ask HN: Why has it taken so long for “dark mode” to become popular?","type":"story"},{"by":"any1","descendants":5,"id":22736047,"kids":[22746340,22747370,22756621],"score":16,"time":1585646871,"title":"Checking Frame Damage on the GPU","type":"story","url":"https://andri.yngvason.is/checking-frame-damage.html"},{"by":"dmitrygr","descendants":29,"id":22735961,"kids":[22757590,22759184,22762107,22759979,22758791,22759103,22759073,22760712,22761023,22759752],"score":106,"time":1585645502,"title":"Achieving full-motion video on the Nintendo 64 (2000) [pdf]","type":"story","url":"https://ultra64.ca/files/other/Game-Developer-Magazine/GDM_September_2000_Achieving_Full-Motion_Video_on_the_Nintnedo_64.pdf"},{"by":"timcc50","descendants":56,"id":22735978,"kids":[22736080,22736033,22736426,22737390,22736238,22737034,22737170,22737754,22736687,22736268,22737388],"score":114,"time":1585645792,"title":"Binance to acquire CoinMarketCap for $400M","type":"story","url":"https://decrypt.co/24031/binance-to-acquire-coinmarketcap-in-400-million-deal"},{"by":"aladine","descendants":5,"id":22735997,"kids":[22738671,22743585,22757518,22759026],"score":4,"text":"Due to the spreading of Covid-19, many events&#x2F;tech conferences are switching to online this year.

This seems like it would introduce a maintainability issue within the code to support 50 operations and lead to code redundancy.<p>Curious if others have encountered a similar problem.","time":1585617547,"title":"Ask HN: How would you an API to handle request variability by US state?","type":"story"},{"by":"ferros","descendants":25,"id":22734075,"kids":[22734556,22746101,22740403,22736672,22734505,22735839,22737677,22735897,22734083,22746305,22740718,22735866,22742464,22744722,22734130,22736495,22734584,22741515,22735105,22734251],"score":13,"text":"Hi all,<p>Now that we’re in lockdown I’m planning to try and code&#x2F;produce something every day to be productive.<p>Curious to know what everyone else is working on outside of their normal work.","time":1585617633,"title":"Ask HN: What are you working on in lockdown?","type":"story"},{"by":"paddlesteamer","descendants":6,"id":22734018,"kids":[22734108,22734096],"score":5,"time":1585616983,"title":"HTTPS Is a Privacy Nightmare","type":"story","url":"https://0x90.psaux.io/2020/03/31/HTTPS-Is-A-Privacy-Nightmare/"},{"by":"bigpumpkin","descendants":9,"id":22733938,"kids":[22734125,22734824],"score":41,"time":1585616230,"title":"Amazon fires warehouse worker who led strike for more coronavirus protection","type":"story","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/30/amazon-fires-staten-island-coronavirus-strike-leader-chris-smalls.html"},{"by":"ssklash","descendants":70,"id":22733815,"kids":[22736763,22734367,22734200,22734365,22734545,22734209,22734288,22734301,22734283,22734211,22734392,22734236,22734246,22734227,22734274,22734485,22734210,22734253,22734478],"score":67,"time":1585614965,"title":"On “Armchair Epidemiology”","type":"story","url":"https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4695"},{"by":"mutablematter","descendants":2,"id":22733726,"kids":[22733883,22734163],"score":5,"time":1585614243,"title":"Bailing out the Airlines is a Moral Hazard","type":"story","url":"https://mailchi.mp/723a0c4072df/airlines-bankruptcy-bailouts-and-moral-hazard"},{"by":"Kaibeezy","descendants":13,"id":22733511,"kids":[22733724,22733915,22733602,22733526,22733881],"score":3,"time":1585612846,"title":"Ask HN: Won’t emergency ventilator production destroy the ventilator business?","type":"story"},{"by":"clouddrover","descendants":7,"id":22733327,"kids":[22733735,22735324,22734782,22733484],"score":12,"time":1585611723,"title":"Why Taiwan has become a problem for WHO","type":"story","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-52088167"},{"by":"dyukqu","descendants":2,"id":22733301,"kids":[22733522,22734030],"score":3,"text":"Hi HN. \nHope you&#x27;re all well. \nI&#x27;d really like to hear&#x2F;read the thoughts of this community about the good (in any field of life) that can come out of the hard times we&#x27;re in nowadays.\nThank you.

The constant barrage of highly-curated, highly-targeted, and polished posts are turning people away from these platforms. More people are taking refuge in online communities and messaging apps devoid of ads and self-promotion. So, how do brands reach these savvy and wary consumers in an authentic way on social media?<p>Authenticity.<p>Like consumers, brands worry about the content they share with the larger global audience. They must promote photos and videos that appeal to their core customers without alienating or offending others. Needless to say, brands also need channel(s) on social media to share most comfortably. Diverse and inclusive companies are starting to build private communities on social media where they can share more casually and engage their followers. In these private communities, brands are also able to crowdsource customer-generated content and receive feedback from their fans. All of this helps build trust and loyalty among consumers.<p>Our startup, Pixz, is focusing on building channels for individuals and companies to share together.<p>Pixz (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pixzapp.com) is a private photo sharing app for groups and events that allows people to crowdsource photos in real-time without hashtags and uploads.<p>Main Features:<p>1. Create unlimited private groups for any occasion and&#x2F;or audience\n2. Take photos that share instantly &amp; privately within group\n3. Crowdsource photos from guests at events in real-time\n4. Upload up to 5 photos at a time with separate captions\n5. Schedule events to limit posts before or after an event\n6. Share and download full-resolution photos from group members\n7. Comment and like photos people share like other social networks\n8. Discover groups and events near you<p>Pixz is a free download from the app stores.<p>Email me with questions &amp; feedback: mkelso@pixzapp.com","time":1585435411,"title":"Show HN: Create a free photo sharing social network for your Startup","type":"story"},{"by":"throzzzaway","descendants":1,"id":22714888,"kids":[22715999,22715871],"score":2,"text":"I’m a senior frontend engineer.

I noticed two suspicious things:<p>a) The app is distributed as a .pkg installer, which is normally used only for stuff that requires special permissions or doesn&#x27;t make sense as a runnable application, such as a user space filesystem or a kernel extension.<p>b) The installer warns me about the installer &quot;inspecting whether the package can be installed on the system or not&quot; and clicking OK, the installer doesn&#x27;t run the normal steps any normal macOS installer would, it just quits. However, it does end up copying Zoom.app under &#x2F;Applications.<p>This seems very suspicious for just a chat application.

This could be pushing a new commit, or creating an issue on a repository. But if you just want to run an arbitrary action, there&#x27;s not currently a good way to do that.<p>This is a well known feature request:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.community&#x2F;t5&#x2F;GitHub-Actions&#x2F;GitHub-Actions-Manual-Trigger-Approvals&#x2F;td-p&#x2F;31504\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.community&#x2F;t5&#x2F;GitHub-Actions&#x2F;GitHub-Actions-Ma...</a><p>GitHub somewhat recently added an API for `repository_dispatch` which is an available trigger for a GitHub Action. There are many blog posts that explain how you can create a Personal Access Token to send your own `repository_dispatch` via some curl command or postman request.<p>For example:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goobar.io&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;07&#x2F;manually-trigger-a-github-actions-workflow&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goobar.io&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;07&#x2F;manually-trigger-a-github-actio...</a><p>ActionsPanel uses this same API but does so with a GitHub App token so that you don&#x27;t need to worry about managing your own PAT.

We are examining problems with existing modes of social media and exploring affirmative visions for social media that are good for individuals and society.<p>At this point, the class is working on case studies of successful and healthy online communities, where we are seeking insights from online communities we are part of, inspired by, or find interesting. The goal of the assignment is to figure out whether an online community exemplifies or doesn’t exemplify ‘healthy’ behaviors, from the points of view of their own members, on their own terms. I’m here to understand HN from your perspectives and I’m interested in hearing from all of you.<p>What criteria do you use to determine &#x27;health&#x27; in online communities? How do these differ from those criteria you use to determine ‘health’ in offline communities you are in? How does HN exemplify or not exemplify &#x27;healthy&#x27; behaviors? What behaviors of your own would you acknowledge may or may not contribute to the overall ‘health’ of HN?<p>How did you get into HN? Who introduced you? What makes you stay?<p>I began using HN as a source for news, projects, ideas, etc. a couple years ago when a mentor referred me here, but I hadn’t made an account until this week for this Ask HN. I check HN once or twice daily and I actually stay for the discussion as much as the links shared by HN members.<p>In case this is helpful for our discussion, something that our class recently discussed is that communities with controversy aren&#x27;t necessarily &#x27;unhealthy&#x27; — as in, the ability of some communities to work through a controversy and maintain coherence, and to exist as multiple voices coming out of a controversy can be an indicator of being &#x27;healthy&#x27;.<p>I aim to share my findings as well. I hope these questions are interesting to you and that we can hear a variety of perspectives in the comments!","time":1585324963,"title":"Ask HN: Is HN a ‘healthy online community’?

I was only to graduate from High School even though I failed 2 core subjects (biology and chemistry) because of the &quot;mercy&quot; of the respective teachers that taught me those subjects.<p>I objectively think I am a failure because of the reasons described beforehand &amp; other causes.<p>Therefore, what are some help&#x2F;advice&#x2F;mentoring resources online both free and&#x2F;or paid that could help me out in my current situation?<p>Thanks in advance.","time":1585263982,"title":"Ask HN: Looking for help/advice/mentoring resources online, free or paid","type":"story"},{"by":"crazygringo","descendants":1,"id":22698880,"kids":[22699517,22700021],"score":15,"time":1585263727,"title":"Trump Wants to ‘Reopen America.’ Here’s What Happens If We Do","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/25/opinion/coronavirus-trump-reopen-america.html"},{"by":"ClarendonDrive","descendants":6,"id":22698718,"kids":[22699026,22698878,22699248,22702574],"score":7,"time":1585262449,"title":"Coronavirus skeptics, deniers: Why some of us stick to deadly beliefs","type":"story","url":"https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/03/26/coronavirus-skeptics-deniers-why-some-of-us-stick-to-deadly-beliefs/"},{"by":"benod","descendants":7,"id":22698713,"kids":[22698851,22699094,22698983,22699042],"score":24,"time":1585262423,"title":"Studios would be banned from selling loot boxes to minors under new bill (2019)","type":"story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18536806/game-studios-banned-loot-boxes-minors-bill-hawley-josh-blizzard-ea"},{"by":"stakkur","descendants":8,"id":22698792,"kids":[22698817,22698849],"score":2,"time":1585262959,"title":"Number of coronavirus cases and deaths in US pale in comparison to seasonal flu","type":"story","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Health/coronavirus-map-tracking-spread-us-world/story?id=69415591"},{"by":"notlukesky","descendants":2,"id":22698522,"kids":[22699388,22699409],"score":10,"time":1585260863,"title":"The world simply can’t afford China-style coronavirus lockdowns","type":"story","url":"https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3077055/world-simply-cant-afford-china-style-coronavirus-lockdowns"},{"by":"doener","descendants":101,"id":22698472,"kids":[22698498,22698684,22698602,22698714,22698725,22698769,22698844,22700709,22698630,22699262,22698532],"score":86,"time":1585260392,"title":"US now nation with most coronavirus cases","type":"story","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52056586"},{"by":"stooderrr","descendants":3,"id":22698419,"kids":[22698458,22708514],"score":6,"time":1585260003,"title":"Show HN: Improve your front-end coding skills by building real projects","type":"story","url":"https://www.frontendmentor.io/"},{"by":"fsflover","descendants":81,"id":22698299,"kids":[22700592,22701458,22699816,22703635,22701296,22700681,22700410,22701494,22700291,22699700,22699912,22701605,22699658,22705099,22701028,22702245,22700302],"score":394,"time":1585258983,"title":"Our list of free software for remote work","type":"story","url":"https://puri.sm/posts/our-essential-list-of-free-software-for-remote-work/"},{"by":"spking","descendants":11,"id":22698306,"kids":[22700974,22700420,22701882,22701025,22700837,22700917],"score":66,"time":1585259021,"title":"Retroshare: Secure Communication for Everyone","type":"story","url":"https://retroshare.cc/"},{"by":"ainhu","descendants":9,"id":22698154,"kids":[22700480,22702509,22698590,22736255,22704861],"score":9,"text":"How do you handle database migration on production servers without downtime?<p>We are currently struggling to find the right strategy to handle migrations of our database schemas without downtime.

It&#x27;s like a fire drill, but for cybersecurity.<p>Prior to Riot, I was the co-founder and CTO of a fintech company operating hundred of millions of euros of transactions every year. We were under attack continuously. I was doing an hour-long security training once a year, but was always curious if my team was really ready for an attack. In fact, it kept me up at night thinking we were spending a lot of money on protecting our app, but none on preparing the employees for social engineering.<p>So I started a side project at that previous company to test this out. On the first run, 9% of all the employees got scammed. I was pissed, but it convinced me we needed a better way to train employees for cybersecurity attacks. This is what grew into Riot.<p>For now we are only training for phishing, but our intention is to grow this into a tool that will continuously prepare your team for good practices (don&#x27;t reuse passwords for example) and upcoming attacks (CEO fraud is next), in a smart way.<p>Your questions, feedback, and ideas are most welcome.

You might know me from previous posts such as &quot;Go channels are bad and you should feel bad&quot; (bad example), &quot;Whiteboard problems in pure lambda Calculus&quot; (good example), or being one of the first to write about switching my company from Python to Go back in 2014.<p>I&#x27;ve been working with the team here at Storj Labs to build a decentralized Amazon S3-compatible cloud storage service that is affordable, private, and secure. We just launched our new service called Tardigrade (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tardigrade.io&#x2F;) and I&#x27;d love to get input from more developers. It&#x27;s open source (check out the GitHub repo at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;storj&#x2F;storj) and we&#x27;re primarily using Go (naturally).<p>If you haven&#x27;t heard of Storj, the simplified explanation is that we are the Airbnb of hard drives. We take extra HDD space, aggregate it, incorporate Reed Solomon and other techniques to create resiliency, and sell it as a service to people who need object storage. The end result is a service that is encrypted by default, as fast as the big 3 cloud providers, and half the cost.<p>We&#x27;ve gone through a bit of a rebirth in the last few years. After hiring Ben Golub (Docker, Gluster, Verisign) as our new CEO, in 2018 we launched a 90 page, very detailed, technical whitepaper (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;storj.io&#x2F;storjv3.pdf) for our new storage system, in 2019 we launched our alphas and betas, and now we&#x27;re launching open access to our service!

We make a box that lets sports bars and other businesses replace live TV commercials with content their customers actually care about.<p>A year and a half ago, I was sitting in a local bar and saw a commercial showing that the same beer I was drinking was cheaper across the street.   The place I was in had other drinks on specials for way cheaper and great happy hour food, but they didn’t have an effective way to tell me about it.  I ended up walking away feeling ripped off when I could have left a happy customer if they had been able to more effectively make me aware of their specials.<p>It got me investigating how businesses communicate with their customers.  I found out that half of all restaurants close within a year and that one of the most common reasons they fail is because they’re unable to educate their customers about everything they offer and what events they have coming up.  We built Taiv to give business owners a way to communicate with their customers, by showing content during commercial breaks on the TVs people are already watching.<p>Taiv uses custom hardware that lets us analyze the cable box’s video output in real-time.  It also lets us switch between passing the content through, or showing videos from another input.  But it turns out that a harder part of the problem is the analysis for classifying video.  We compute a bunch of different heuristics and use the combination of their outputs to classify video as either a commercial or content. For example, one of our heuristics looks at average color balance over small periods of time.  When the color balance shifts significantly, it indicates that a scene has changed.  We use a bunch of other similar heuristics, which in combination, allow us to classify the stream with good accuracy.<p>Some of our customers have increased their sales by thousands of dollars a month.  It also makes the experience a lot better for <i>their</i> customers.  TV commercials are annoying and loud, and we replace that with relevant and non-intrusive content and music.  Some of our customers even use the commercial breaks to show funny videos without any advertising at all.  Not all of our customers are restaurants.  We also work with car dealerships, car washes, hotels, and gyms to give them control over what they show and help them educate their customers.<p>One of the biggest challenges we’re facing is that we’re getting the most traction from larger enterprises, but are having trouble really connecting with smaller businesses.  We think the product could be really valuable for them, especially since they don&#x27;t usually have as much marketing reach.  But we’re having trouble portraying the value of the system when they can’t track how it affects their revenue nearly as accurately.  We’d love to hear the community’s experience and ideas in this area, as well as any questions or feedback!","time":1584985862,"title":"Launch HN: Taiv (YC W20) – Replace TV commercials with content people care about","type":"story"},{"by":"matthberg","descendants":2,"id":22666967,"kids":[22667981,22667102],"score":8,"time":1584987535,"title":"YouTube's Copyright System Isn't Broken.

The first grader is pretty much auto-pilot when given some daily academic structure. The toddler is the most difficult to manage which requires constant attention. As a software engineer and team lead I have both technical and administrative responsibilities.

This is exponential spread.  This will remain true until enough people have immunity that the chance of infecting someone new drops below 1.  This is the so called &quot;herd immunity&quot;.  This requires 60-70% of a population to have immunity.<p>Immunity comes from a person having been exposed to the virus and getting better, or a vaccine.  To get to the 60-70% point in the US, roughly 220 million people need to be exposed and heal, or get vaccinated.<p>Getting 220 million people exposed, at a rate of 1 million per month (which will still overwhelm the health care system) would take almost 20 years.  Flattening the curve simply takes too long with such a large population.  Finding, creating, distributing and vaccinating 220 million people would take a number of years?  (guessing on that).<p>No government can afford to pump $1 trillion into the economy every quarter to prop it up, and do this for a number of years.  They will have to start printing money to do that, which leads directly to hyperinflation, which destroys countries and leads to starvation and death.<p>Isolation delays the inevitable but doesn&#x27;t stop it.  Testing and tracing contacts to isolate the infected only works if it is perfect.   If we miss 1 person out of 330 million in the US, that 1 person will start the entire cycle again.

HN!<p>We&#x27;re Carolyn and Ryan, founders of nextmv (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nextmv.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nextmv.io&#x2F;</a>). We help developers build and test logistics algorithms faster. These are things like routing delivery vehicles, assigning nurses to patients, and managing supply chains.<p>We used to work in systems engineering and operations research on big government projects, including missile simulations and airport runway management. A few years ago, we pivoted to working on food delivery at Zoomer (YC S14) and later Grubhub. It turned out that making on-demand pizza and taco delivery efficient and reliable required the same optimization and simulation techniques, but in real time.<p>Real-time routing and assignment problems have a number of interesting characteristics that make them challenging. For example, they follow business rules such as pickups preceding deliveries, time windows for deliveries which may or may not be violated, and driver capacities. Their inputs are constantly changing. They can get very large (1000s of orders, 100s of drivers). And they require high-quality solutions in seconds.<p>People usually think of NP-hard problems like the Traveling Salesman when routing and dispatch optimization is mentioned, and we do have to solve those. But the biggest challenges turn out to be ones that are more familiar to the software engineering community. There is no easy equivalent to the software unit test for techniques such as Integer Programming and Constraint Programming. And integration into modern software stacks is nontrivial. In the end, we had to build new tools so we could work faster.<p>Traditional dispatch and scheduling algorithms take months to develop, integrate, and test. That is a problem when businesses change rapidly. This is happening in delivery, which has exploded over the last few years and is likely to only get bigger. Existing tools require domain experts to translate business rules into models. This makes organizations unable to keep pace with change.<p>During our research into appropriate techniques, we learned about Decision Diagrams (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.andrew.cmu.edu&#x2F;user&#x2F;vanhoeve&#x2F;mdd&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.andrew.cmu.edu&#x2F;user&#x2F;vanhoeve&#x2F;mdd&#x2F;</a>). DDs represent optimization problems as the search for a shortest (or longest) path over a layered, directed, graph. They are state-based, have few restrictions on problem representation, and can outperform other techniques (depending, of course, on the model). We find them particularly attractive for getting started with simple models and integrating them into software stacks. Since there weren&#x27;t any industrial-grade DD solvers, we built one. And we started nextmv to give companies the modeling, optimization, and simulation tools we wish we&#x27;d had.<p>Our tools are for software developers with deadlines. They let you flexibly model nearly any business rules, easily integrate models into software stacks, and test them so you know they&#x27;re behaving as you expect.<p>What can you do with them? Dynamically route buses based on passenger requests. Minimize shipping cost for packages. Schedule workers based on demand forecasts. Hop (our optimizer) lets you model decision problems as state machines. Dash (our simulator) is also state-based, so you can optimize and simulate using the same code.<p>We&#x27;ve prioritized making things developer-friendly. You can write and test models like any other software. Larger, more complex models can be composed out of smaller, simpler ones. Optimization and simulation models are built from Go source into simple binary artifacts. (We think of this as Docker for decision science.) They come with pre-built runners that make going from development to testing in CI to production deployment trivial. They have JSON I&#x2F;O for easy integration, and run in a CLI, over HTTP, or in Lambda.<p>Not all operational decisions need complex optimization, but they all benefit from simple automation and integration, fast iteration cycles, and continual visibility. We give you this from the beginning, then let you layer in fancier optimization stuff if you need it later. Here&#x27;s a screen cast showing a simple routing model in Lambda: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;65ad523138364bf7bac48524efb620e0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;65ad523138364bf7bac48524efb620e0</a>. We&#x27;ve seen developers without optimization backgrounds create models to minimize delivery time and deploy them to Lambda in less than 24 hours.<p>We&#x27;re eager to hear about your experiences in this area and&#x2F;or ideas on faster ways to get automation into production. We would love any and all feedback that this community can offer, so don&#x27;t hold back!","time":1584643807,"title":"Launch HN: Nextmv (YC W20) – Developer-friendly logistics algorithms","type":"story"},{"by":"shawncampbell","descendants":5,"id":22629457,"kids":[22630043,22629557],"score":5,"time":1584637769,"title":"Ask HN: Advice for family getting started with Lego building?","type":"story"},{"by":"tintinnabula","descendants":55,"id":22629343,"kids":[22643012,22641180,22642282,22641408,22643193,22643682,22643410,22642730],"score":89,"time":1584637163,"title":"In Praise of Phone Calls","type":"story","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/in-praise-of-phone-calls"},{"by":"prismatic","descendants":13,"id":22629255,"kids":[22634549,22636229,22633401,22636292,22636378,22635421,22635511,22636106,22633792],"score":29,"time":1584636582,"title":"The Art World’s Mini-Madoff and Me","type":"story","url":"https://www.vulture.com/2020/03/inigo-philbrick-art-dealer.html"},{"by":"spking","descendants":45,"id":22629105,"kids":[22629463,22629434,22629340,22629386,22629621,22629476,22629492,22630010,22629252,22629407],"score":61,"time":1584635665,"title":"Bank of America says the recession is already here","type":"story","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/19/bank-of-america-says-the-recession-is-already-here-jobs-will-be-lost-wealth-will-be-destroyed.html"},{"by":"daniel-cussen","descendants":27,"id":22629053,"kids":[22629056,22632227,22635168,22631386,22645791,22631099],"score":62,"time":1584635455,"title":"Skylinesort","type":"story","url":"http://www.skylinesort.com"},{"by":"jonmarkgo","descendants":8,"id":22629033,"kids":[22629106,22629181,22630040,22629801,22629453],"score":19,"time":1584635308,"title":"Charity fundraiser job fair to help quarantined students","type":"story","url":"https://careerfest.mlh.io/"},{"by":"Arnie0426","descendants":4,"id":22629010,"kids":[22630060,22630271],"score":8,"time":1584635177,"title":"Coronavirus Is a Disaster for Feminism","type":"story","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/03/feminism-womens-rights-coronavirus-covid19/608302/"},{"by":"mawus","descendants":4,"id":22629006,"kids":[22629088,22629118],"score":1,"time":1584635159,"title":"Show HN: An iOS app for building and tracking your habits","type":"story","url":"https://metricalapp.com"},{"by":"stefan8r","descendants":156,"id":22629023,"kids":[22631771,22632588,22631267,22631201,22631067,22631798,22632134,22637629,22637480,22632363,22632722,22630791,22631690,22631071,22631894,22631623,22631482,22632834,22632471,22636824,22631658,22636413,22631136,22635963,22632244,22634082,22639635,22633602,22631678,22634099,22647554,22633161,22633571,22634982,22636415,22633912,22634637,22636761],"score":357,"time":1584635259,"title":"The End of Starsky Robotics","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/starsky-robotics-blog/the-end-of-starsky-robotics-acb8a6a8a5f5"},{"by":"gortok","descendants":290,"id":22628961,"kids":[22630340,22630517,22629289,22629600,22629861,22629566,22629828,22630069,22630404,22630222,22635361,22629998,22629656,22629986,22629371,22630651,22629743,22635156,22629913,22630193,22629814,22631488,22630829,22629350,22629821,22629703,22636454,22629952,22630203,22630354,22630896,22630349,22630820,22635448,22630059,22635074,22629945,22629995,22633227,22629752,22630681,22633761,22629775,22630080],"score":508,"time":1584634902,"title":"GitHub shuts off access to Aurelia repository, citing trade sanctions","type":"story","url":"https://twitter.com/eisenbergeffect/status/1240671036292485121"},{"by":"LurkersWillLurk","descendants":2,"id":22628916,"kids":[22634880,22637819],"score":14,"time":1584634663,"title":"The Accusations Were Lies.

I hope someone one the field can fact-check the information presented and correct any interpretation mistakes on my part:<p>- The test that is currently used was not extensively validated and quickly accepted by WHO due to urgency. This raises the following questions:\n  - Is it possible that we are seeing false positives, where people with flu-like symptoms are wrongly identified as having SARS-CoV-2?\n  - Are we certain that the test is implemented correctly everywhere?<p>- To find infection&#x2F;death rates, are we doing tests on the whole population, or only on certain groups, such as people that went to hospitals feeling cold symptoms?<p>- Is it possible that infection rates are higher than normal because more people are going to hospitals (due to widespread panic), and thus get infected more easily than if they had treated common cold symptoms at home?<p>- Are the flu deaths increasing because of the coronavirus? Consider this:\n  - In Germany, between 20000 and 30000 people die yearly from flu, mostly on winter.\n  - Assume that in previous years we tested all seriously ill patients for coronavirus (which didn&#x27;t happen). In this scenario, where we tested everyone, it is expected that between 2000 and 3000 of the dead would also have a coronavirus (which doesn&#x27;t imply they died because of coronavirus).\n  - Due to panic, more people are filling the hospital beds, possibly leaving the really sick without proper care, thus increasing deaths.\n  - In Germany, there are currently 33 deaths attributed to coronavirus, nowhere near the expected number.

fellow hackers.<p>This is probably a long shot - and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll see quite a few posts like this over the coming weeks - but I&#x27;m going to swallow my pride and ask nonetheless.<p>I&#x27;ve been a data entry clerk for the past twenty years, working for a major bookmaker in Northern Ireland. With the coronavirus pandemic hitting recently, many businesses have decided to lay off large numbers of staff. I&#x27;ve just become one of the unfortunate victims of one of these layoffs today, with a mortgage to pay, a wife and two young children to support.<p>I&#x27;ve also been programming, in my own time, over the past seven years or so, in Python 3, Javascript and PHP mainly. Over that time I&#x27;ve developed a number of tools that were used in my former place of employ, to scrape data from websites and automate the process of data entry. I&#x27;ve also built some online tools in Javascript and PHP for scraping&#x2F;munging data. Most recently, until the coronavirus hit and unemployment loomed, I was working on a Mario&#x2F;NES style level editor in HTML5 and a random tile generator for building platformer levels, while I learned C++ and wrote a platforming engine to develop a platform game for release on Steam.<p>I&#x27;ve placed a number of these tool in public repos on github. You can check them out at:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Zleet<p>I&#x27;ve also got a resume ready to go for anyone that&#x27;s interested. What I&#x27;m looking for is any remote programming job that fits my skillset and will enable me to keep a roof over my family&#x27;s head and food in the cupboard for the next few months.<p>I apologise for posting something like this here. I&#x27;ve been reading hacker news for years now. It&#x27;s my favourite website.

This is James from RemoteWork.com (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;remotework.com&#x2F;)<p>I am building a marketplace for the remote worker community, and to connect remote jobs to remote workers. I hope for this not to become just another jobs board. I am much more interested in helping remote workers solve for loneliness and build community, shift skilled work away from the coastal cities and other &quot;soft&quot; benefits of remote work.<p>Like many other readers here on Hacker News I am following the Shelter-in-Place order in the bay area due to COVID-19. I have been sitting on RemoteWork.com as a concept since before 2017. I was originally inspired by Greg Caplan and his Remote Year (RemoteYear.com) project, I looked up LeapYear.com and stumbled upon Venture.com, they happened to have RemoteWork.com available &amp; I have always had it on my shortlist of domains to use for a future concept. Then around NYE of 2020, as everyone was making predictions about what the next decade held, a consistent theme was that a shift towards remote work would become one of the big shifts of the 2020s. Who could have guessed it would happen so fast? I secured a lease with Venture.com shortly after Jan 1st. I setup a no-code MVP using Sharetribe Go.<p>I have been working remotely or part of a remote team for the past 5 years &amp; am familiar with the challenges it presents to the individual and to the organization. Personally, I really wanted to solve for the community and educational side of people beginning to work remotely. Working remotely may not be for everyone, but I think it could be a benefit for most people who are able to perform their jobs without being in an office, if given the right tools and guidelines outlining best practices.<p>This is just the beginning. I hope we can start a movement that benefits both workers and employers. A movement that can reduce traffic congestion and improve overall job satisfaction thru work&#x2F;life balance.<p>Join us.

We&#x27;re building a platform to run Docker applications close to end users. It&#x27;s kind of like a content delivery network, but for backend servers.<p>I helped build Ars Technica and spent the majority of my time trying to make the site fast. We used a content delivery network to cache static content close to anonymous readers and it worked very well for them. But the most valuable readers were not these, but the ones who paid for subscriptions. They wanted personalized content and features for interacting with the community – and we couldn&#x27;t make those fast. Content delivery networks don&#x27;t work for Ars Technica&#x27;s best customers.<p>Running Docker apps close to users helps get past the &quot;slow&quot; speed of light. Most interactions with an app server seem slow because of latency between the hardware it&#x27;s running on (frequently in Virginia) and the end user (frequently not in Virginia). Moving server apps close to users is a simple way to decrease latency, sometimes by 80% or more.<p>fly.io is really a way to run Docker images on servers in different cities and a global router to connect users to the nearest available instance. We convert your Docker image into a root filesystem, boot tiny VMs using a project called Firecracker (recently discussed here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22512196\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22512196</a>) and then proxy connections to it. As your app gets more traffic, we add VMs in the most popular locations.<p>We wrote a Rust based router to distribute incoming connections from end users. The router terminates TLS when necessary (some customers handle their own TLS) and then hands the connection off to the best available Firecracker VM, which is frequently in a different city.<p>Networking took us a lot of time to get right. Applications get dedicated IP addresses from an Anycast block. Anycast is an internet routing feature that lets us &quot;announce&quot; from multiple datacenters, and then core routers pick the destination with the shortest route (mostly).  We run a mesh Wireguard network for backhaul, so in flight data is encrypted all the way into a user application. This is the same kind of network infrastructure the good content delivery networks use.<p>We got a handful of enterprise companies to pay for this, and spent almost a year making it simple to use — it takes 3 commands to deploy a Docker image and have it running in 17 cities: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fly.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;speedrun&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fly.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;speedrun&#x2F;</a>. We also built &quot;Turboku&quot; to speed up Heroku apps. Pick a Heroku app and we deploy the slug on our infrastructure .. typical Heroku apps are 800ms faster on fly.io: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fly.io&#x2F;heroku&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fly.io&#x2F;heroku&#x2F;</a><p>We&#x27;ve also built some features based on Hacker News comments. When people launch container hosting on Hacker News, there&#x27;s almost always a comment asking for:<p>1. gRPC support: apps deployed to fly.io can accept any kind of TCP connection. We kept seeing people say &quot;hey I want to run gRPC servers on this shiney container runtime&quot;. So you can! You can specify if you want us to do TLS or HTTP for an app, or just do everything yourself.<p>2. Max monthly spend: unexpected traffic spikes happen, and the thought of spending an unbounded amount of money in a month is really uncomfortable. You can configure fly.io apps with a max monthly budget, we&#x27;ll suspend them when they hit that budget, and then re-enable them at the beginning of the next month.<p>One of the best parts of building this has been seeing the problems that developers are trying to solve, often problems we didn&#x27;t know about beforehand. My favorite is a project to re-encode MP3s at variable speeds for specific users (apparently the Apple Audiobook player has no option for playback speed). Another is &quot;TensorFlow at the edge&quot; — they trained a TensorFlow model to detect bots and run predictions before handling requests.<p>We&#x27;re really happy we get to show this to you all, thank you for reading about it! Please let us know your thoughts and questions in the comments.","time":1584540907,"title":"Launch HN: Fly.io (YC W20) – Deploy app servers close to your users","type":"story"},{"by":"camjohnson26","descendants":25,"id":22616725,"kids":[22616927,22617182,22616953,22617106,22618189,22616971,22617245],"score":26,"time":1584540098,"title":"Tesla factory is still open for business","type":"story","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/17/tesla-keeps-fremont-factory-open-amid-covid-19-shelter-in-place-orders.html"},{"by":"ragnarsass","descendants":6,"id":22616617,"kids":[22616936,22616621,22616702,22616898,22616763],"score":21,"time":1584539487,"title":"New online accelerator – to combat coronavirus world and aftermath","type":"story","url":"https://salto.co/growth-camp-emerge"},{"by":"RayMan1","dead":true,"id":22616466,"kids":[22616894,22616877,22616934],"score":17,"time":1584538533,"title":"Layoffs in the US running at almost a million a day","type":"story","url":"http://alugy.com/news/layoffs-in-the-us-running-at-almost-a-million-a-day/"},{"by":"nbnoll","descendants":100,"id":22616456,"kids":[22629261,22630624,22629737,22616589,22631090,22632232,22630127,22633197,22631902,22630872,22633012,22633921,22631903,22632551,22630870,22635799,22629859,22630154,22630328],"score":291,"time":1584538475,"title":"Show HN: Covid-19 Interactive Model","type":"story","url":"https://neherlab.org/covid19/"},{"by":"namc","descendants":5,"id":22616394,"kids":[22669973,22618651,22629351],"score":22,"text":"As most of you know the economic meltdown.

Most of the stuff I&#x27;ve worked on has been .net core APIs, occasional front-end and manual sql queries. When I interviewed, I was told that they have an angular&#x2F;.net core app. But few days after I started there, I found that there&#x27;s another old MVC app that&#x27;s been de-prioritized, and they want my help to deciding if it could be updated or completely redone.<p>Our team is small, just 1 principal engineer, 1 senior, and 2 devs, and me. They are all working on the main app, and I&#x27;ve been tasked to look at the old app and tell them whether it should be updated or remake from scratch. It&#x27;s making me a little anxious because I don&#x27;t have any experience in designing app this complex, and I feel like they are expecting a lot from me even though I only 2.5 years of experience. I asked to have permission to see the code base, but they only gave me access to the old app, and finally gave me the access to see the frontend code of the main app. Every standup I feel left out because they&#x27;re all working on the main app, and I just say I&#x27;m poking around the code of the old app and trying to familiarize myself with it.<p>I&#x27;ve emphasized that my strength is in working with .net core APIs but they haven&#x27;t give me access to the repo.

I&#x27;m not sure where to start, they say the product manager is designing a new flow for the app, and I feel like I can&#x27;t really make any meaningful decision before knowing what the new flow is.

We can produce a ton of value from nothing but some gibberish written on a screen and connections made online.<p>Take advantage of that: it&#x27;ll be less excruciating and anxiety-inducing than following the media frenzy on this.","time":1584395674,"title":"Tell HN: Just keep building cool things","type":"story"},{"by":"fooey","descendants":113,"id":22598309,"kids":[22599509,22598639,22598708,22600027,22598636,22599652,22598839,22600565,22600056,22598731,22598468],"score":119,"time":1584395262,"title":"Discord Is Having an Outage","type":"story","url":"https://status.discordapp.com/"},{"by":"cl42","descendants":2,"id":22598296,"kids":[22598544,22599867],"score":34,"time":1584395229,"title":"Amazon ramps hiring, opening 100k new roles","type":"story","url":"https://blog.aboutamazon.com/operations/amazon-opening-100000-new-roles"},{"by":"chmaynard","descendants":258,"id":22598009,"kids":[22598376,22598597,22598625,22598915,22598874,22599187,22598662,22598712,22599122,22599645,22599167,22598978,22599197,22598672,22599504,22598999,22599368,22602690,22599385,22598715,22599199,22598996,22599242,22599532,22599537,22602337,22598989,22599351,22599344,22599390,22599165,22598617,22598686,22599192,22598852,22598694,22598749,22599065,22598682,22598359,22598851,22598714,22599408],"score":341,"time":1584393682,"title":"The hard part of the economics of Covid-19","type":"story","url":"https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/flattening-the-coronavirus-curve-is-not-enough/"},{"by":"mikemccormick","descendants":5,"id":22597918,"kids":[22603509,22601295,22597943,22598403],"score":15,"text":"We&#x27;re building coronacarecard.com, which will allow any local business affected by the coronavirus to accept gift cards and tips from loyal customers during the COVID-19 shut-down.<p>We have a bunch of resources behind us including some back end devs, designers, AWS credits, a bit of grant funding etc. We&#x27;re in need of one or two full stack engineers to help build out the MVP so we can ship and start supporting small businesses ASAP.

I wasn&#x27;t around when Lisp machines were in their heyday, but I&#x27;ve read a lot of Hacker News comments and websites about them, particularly the machines that Symbolics produced.  I have also played in the Pharo environment.<p>There&#x27;s something very appealing about these &quot;turtles-all-the-way-down&quot; environments where all of the objects in the system are live and can be inspected by using a REPL, and how system behavior can be changed on-the-fly.  A part of me is very interested in taking an environment like Pharo and building some utilities within the environment with the eventual goal of using it as a daily-driver operating system, or at the very least an environment I regularly use on top of an existing operating system like Linux or Windows.<p>However, one question that I have about Smalltalk and historical Lisp machine environments is whether there has been any work done on implementing support for other languages, and what that would look like in these environments.  While I love the appeal of a system in which every program is implemented in the same language, the reason why different languages exist is because some problems can be expressed easier in certain languages.  For example, there are some types of programs that benefit from Haskell&#x27;s strong typing and functional programming approaches and thus would be easier to write in Haskell than in Smalltalk or Lisp.  It would be possible to write some type of Haskell interpreter or compiler that uses Smalltalk&#x27;s or Lisp&#x27;s object model, preserving the &quot;turtles-all-the-way-down&quot; feel of the system despite the fact that the code was written in Haskell instead of Smalltalk or Lisp.

We help people quit opioids without going to rehab. We offer online doctor&#x27;s visits, medication for withdrawal and cravings, and long-term support for recovery.<p>There’s a treatment for opioid addiction that works, and it’s low-cost, discreet, and convenient. It’s called medication-assisted treatment (or MAT), it reduces mortality by more than 5x [1], and it resembles treatment for anxiety or depression: medication and therapy. Yet 80% of the 3 million Americans addicted to opioids are not getting it. You can read more about MAT at [2] [3] [4].<p>I decided to work on this problem after my girlfriend died of an overdose last year. She wanted to quit, but she was afraid of losing her job and her privacy, and she found it easier to get this medication from a drug dealer than a doctor or rehab. The rest of the story is too sad to articulate, and I don’t want this post to be about her. It’s about all of the people just like her, struggling to get help today. This is why we started Ophelia: to lower the barriers to proven, lifesaving treatment.<p>Most Americans struggling with opioids have jobs, families, and privacy concerns that make rehab an impossible option. They want to quit, but they’re afraid of withdrawal, and the medication that helps is too hard to get: doctors need a special waiver to prescribe it, which only 5% of them have [5], so most people are buying it on the black market. Yet, drug dealers aren’t doctors, and the statistics support it: every 11 minutes, another American dies of an opioid overdose – now the #1 cause of death for Americans under 50.<p>As it turns out, rehab is not just unnecessary: the data shows it rarely works anyway [6] [7]. Without medication, 90% of people relapse in the first 3 months: yet, 2&#x2F;3rds of rehabs don’t offer medication, and most don’t even employ doctors! Thus: 80% of people avoid getting help, and the rest succumb to pseudoscience that does nothing to address their problem.<p>Ophelia’s mission is to replace drug dealers with doctors, without any loss of privacy or convenience. We make MAT discreet, convenient, and affordable for anyone who needs help but can’t or won’t go to rehab.<p>Our medical directors are two of the best addiction specialists in the world (Dr. Adam Bisaga and Dr. Arthur Robin Williams, both Columbia Professors and NIH-funded research scientists), and we’re now treating patients in Philadelphia and New York, through a combined in-person and telemedicine approach.<p>There&#x27;s a problem, though: we&#x27;re restricted by regulations from letting people know that this treatment is available. Both Facebook and Google require a third-party certification before allowing us to use their platforms, and many sites like Reddit don&#x27;t allow any advertising for addiction treatment at all.<p>We would love your help figuring out how to get past this bottleneck.<p>The other big problem is the stigma around addiction, which stops most people from sharing success stories about MAT, so its efficacy is underappreciated. If you know anyone who is personally struggling with this issue, please make sure they know about MAT. It can literally save their life.<p>If you have thoughts about how we can solve these problems, I would be grateful for your help: any ideas to increase awareness of MAT, or any stories you can share that may help us better understand the needs of our patients.

We help pull data from databases directly into Google Sheets. It’s basically a live database connector for Google Sheets that allows for data refreshes.<p>Before we started working on this, we were working on an idea around data pipelines. It didn’t take off so we had to pivot mid-batch. We had less than 1 month to do user interviews, build our product, get it approved, and launch it. To start with, we knew we wanted to stay in the data space. We spent the first week talking to over 30 people at different companies. In those conversations, we noticed that sales, marketing, and operations teams constantly need to ask developers to help them export data from the database and often have to submit follow-on data requests because they forgot to add a dimension needed for analysis (they often do this by submitting Jira tickets). This is an inefficient yet surprisingly common thing at companies today. Perhaps even more surprising is that data scientists at big companies like Facebook, who have invested heavily in data infrastructure and analytics tools, often use spreadsheets as a step in their data analysis workflow. While they can pull data for analysis themselves, they too export data into CSV and then open it in a spreadsheet. This means that their data doesn’t update automatically and the process has to be repeated each time.<p>At first, we were considering building our own BI tool to solve this problem. However, during our conversations we noticed that people feel new-tool fatigue, especially when their companies rotate through different tools that are used for the same purpose. For instance, we’ve heard of companies going from Tableau to Looker and back to Tableau. Or from Kibana to Sisense to Looker. Sometimes it feels like companies are paying a lot of money for tools that people aren’t really using just because it’s the thing everybody “needs to have”. Each one comes with its own structure, data modeling and steep learning curve. It&#x27;s overwhelming. At some point people just realize that whatever tool they learn will likely change once a new VP gets hired and wants to do things in a new way. In anticipation of that, they default to the one tool they know how to use and likely won’t be replaced soon. Spreadsheets also happen to be an elegant solution for simple calculations, quick pivots, and high level data exploration. They are elegant in a way that no $50k a year enterprise visualization tool can be - not because they can’t do those things, but because people don’t know how to do it quickly with them. It’s also hard to change workflows for people who live in spreadsheets. Spreadsheets are a pretty good for ad-hoc analysis and summaries that are used for presentations and reports.<p>So instead of another BI tool, we built a Google Sheets add-on that connects to a database and lets them search through tables, filter&#x2F;order the data, and then load it into Sheets directly. In the future, we’ll let them schedule data refreshes for any saved query, so all their calculations and pivot tables update with the latest data from the database. We’ve built our first integration with Postgres and testing a MySQL, MongoDB, and public dataset connector. We plan to add integrations to more data sources, including data warehouses such as Snowflake and BigQuery.<p>We implemented it to only get read-access to the database and we don’t store connection credentials or replicate data in our database. We are focused on data analysis at the moment, but a few customers have requested features to also write into database (write access to the database). Not sure yet how to do this safely with spreadsheets or whether we should at all. We’ve heard suggestions such as database write roll-backs or some intermediate data queue that can be approved by table owners.<p>Other challenges include: (1) building data connectors because many data sources spits out data differently, which means we have to parse it differently to make it accessible from a uniform interface. (2) We make connections to databases and perform all queries using AWS lambda functions (thank you serverless!) Some queries are taking minutes to execute, but AWS drops connection after 29 seconds. (3) It is hard and, as HN often points out, risky to build a product that depends on Google. We&#x27;re also running into Google Sheets&#x27; row limitations - still figuring out a way to work around this for large databases. We’ve been bouncing ideas around building a back-end to perform heavy computations while only displaying a sampled subset of data in the spreadsheet. We think it&#x27;s worth it to plunge ahead despite all these issues, though, because having a spreadsheet interface to their data is very much what our users want. We plan to charge users a monthly fee for use of our product and we&#x27;ll have a HN discount on our basic plan.<p>We’d love to hear about your data analysis workflows, the tools you use to do this, any problems you’ve had getting data for analysis, and of course, your thoughts and experiences on this use of spreadsheets!

My name is Mohammad Rafiee and I am the founder&#x2F;CEO of Visual One (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.visualone.tech\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.visualone.tech</a>) We are building software for security cameras enabling them to  recognize specific events.<p>People use security cameras (aka IP cams) for various purposes—to monitor their properties, their kids, their pets, for elderly care, as doorbells, etc. But a shortcoming these cameras have is they rely mainly on motion detection to alert users and that leads to too many false alarms.<p>What led me to work on this problem initially was my personal experience with the IP cameras which I used to watch my dog and also as a doorbell at my house which I rented out on Airbnb sometimes. After trying some of these cameras (Ring, Nest and Wyze), I realized motion alerts are pretty much useless and person detection that some like Nest offer is not broadly useful. For example, for my dog, I only cared to know if&#x2F;when the dog walker picked her up or if she was doing something bad, like getting into my clothes, chewing my shoes&#x2F;TV remote, getting on the bed, etc. The motion alerts were completely useless as she is moving all the time obviously--person detection was also not useful for any of these events.\nFor my Airbnb rental use case (doorbell&#x2F;outdoor cams), the main things I cared to know about were if the guests parked their cars in the wrong location which pissed off my neighbors, or if the garage door was left open, or if there were a lot more people staying at the house than allowed. Again, motion alerts or person detection were not useful at all.<p>Having a background in machine learning &amp; computer vision, I felt this is a problem that is just starting to become solvable thanks to the powerful deep learning techniques developed in the the last 3-4 years.<p>Over the last 6 months, we have been building a cloud-based solution addressing this shortcoming for any IP camera without any dependency on the hardware. Our software allows users to create custom alerts for things that matter to them, like their dog chewing on shoes, their kid playing with the stove or their packages being stolen by porch pirates. It also allows them to search for past events after the fact instantly.<p>Currently, we support four categories of events:\n- A specific object appeared &#x2F; disappeared, e.g. dog appeared, bicycle disappeared, package disappeared (coming soon.)\n- A specific object in a specific location, e.g. a car parked in front of the driveway, elderly person taking medications, dog in the (neighbor’s) lawn, person getting into the garage.\n- Two objects interacting, e.g. dog getting on the couch, kid playing with the stove, dog chewing on a shoe.\n- Facial recognition based events, e.g. new person detected, a specific person appeared, max occupancy violated.<p>Users can create a new event in any of the above categories by providing a few simple inputs, e.g. pick the objects involved and the interaction between them, or specify a zone. Once the event is created, our software can immediately recognize that event with good accuracy. The users can also give a thumbs up&#x2F;down when they get an alert and their feedback is incorporated back into the models to improve their accuracy over time. Users can adjust the sensitivity for each event (precision and recall trade-off) based on their use case.<p>In addition to the smart alerts described above, we also index the footage in real time to allow users to query for past events after the fact and get the results instantly instead of having to go through all the past footage to find something they care about. For example: users can query the clips of when a laptop disappeared or a truck appeared.<p>Our solution can also alleviate privacy concerns since we only store short video clips on the cloud for alerts corresponding to user’s events of interest instead of for every motion detected.<p>We currently support Nest Cams and also offer our own cameras (same as the cameras sold by Wyze) with indoor and outdoor options.<p>I would love to hear any feedback&#x2F;thoughts you have. We are exploring different niche use cases to focus on initially and would appreciate any thoughts you may have based on your personal experience or any insights you may have.\nFeel free to comment here or shoot me an email at rafiee@visualone.tech","time":1584036675,"title":"Launch HN: Visual One (YC W20) – Event recognition for security cameras","type":"story"},{"by":"lisper","descendants":36,"id":22559838,"kids":[22560273,22561089,22560950,22563783,22562431,22560134,22560270,22560160,22560621,22560303,22561538,22560595,22563305,22560232,22560207,22560524],"score":23,"time":1584036664,"title":"The Samson Switchblade flying car","type":"story","url":"https://www.samsonsky.com/"},{"by":"dumbfoundded","descendants":27,"id":22559826,"kids":[22560195,22560201,22560199,22560382,22561054,22560238,22560262,22560266],"score":22,"time":1584036566,"title":"Don't trust nice people in business","type":"story","url":"https://www.atlassquats.com/post/don-t-trust-nice-people-in-business"},{"by":"jseliger","descendants":93,"id":22559813,"kids":[22560087,22560233,22560285,22560292,22564077,22562926,22560252,22560961,22564338,22560919,22561123,22560085,22565339,22560318],"score":233,"time":1584036484,"title":"New businesses are choosing cities with good public transportation: study","type":"story","url":"https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2019/07/startup-cities-public-transportation-new-business-development/594286"},{"by":"lvh","descendants":65,"id":22559786,"kids":[22561387,22564585,22562935,22560697,22565178,22564634,22562318,22566832,22564120,22562023,22570867,22566660,22564749,22561889,22561780,22566615,22565871,22563662],"score":109,"time":1584036314,"title":"The SOC2 Starting Seven","type":"story","url":"https://latacora.singles/2020/03/12/the-soc-starting.html"},{"by":"peter_d_sherman","descendants":4,"id":22559630,"kids":[22560228,22568653,22559714],"score":1,"time":1584035557,"title":"Adam Andrzejewski – The Depth of the Swamp","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQDEDR0JXdE"},{"by":"amflare","descendants":3,"id":22559613,"kids":[22560006,22565069],"score":8,"text":"We are a two developer team who just release a web application to solve an issue in an existing online community.

Share your ideas!<p>I think that 30&#x2F;40 years from now we will be in a very different place wrt to congregating and working from one location. 100 years ago cars came and replaced the horse and literally shaped our geography, how we live and what we are capable of. The horse did the same prior to the car. In that sense humanity evolved faster in someplaces than other, but evolved we did. We were more happier because of our expanded &#x27;reach&#x27; on different dimensions provided by these new &#x27;technologies and ways of life&#x27;. And after a long time of status quo (horses and then cars) those same sources and the way an individual life stems from it perhaps lead to more unhappiness than happiness - in the case of horses - streets where filled with horseshit which lead to disease etc. In case of cars we have horrible traffic, cities that are filled roads and streets that are more friendly for cars than people as everybody tried to congregate for work and living due to the concentration of economic opportunity. During this time computer and internet changed our capabilities again and they are reshaping access to economic opportunity. however the status quo model of life lead by cars and what they ensued still hold us back I think. And now this viral outbreak almost creates &#x27;space&#x27; for new ideas to be considered or fringe ideas (remote companies&#x2F;work) to be reconsidered which companies like buffer and gitlab have been a champion of and are being ahead of the curve in some ways.<p>There are different levels&#x2F;types of economic opportunities -<p>1)some that can be distributed&#x2F;capitalized upon regardless of geography.

We’re building Terusama\n(<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.terusama.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.terusama.com</a>), a truck appointment system for logistics\nteams at warehouses and distribution centers. We automate the\nlabor-intensive process of coordinating arrival times with a trucking\ncompany, checking a truck in at a facility, and keeping track of\neverything. Oh, and we have a theme song:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=fyp4O4s5tk4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=fyp4O4s5tk4</a><p>The status quo here is really antiquated software that is really hard\nto use. Not only is the current way of doing things inefficient for\nlogistics folks, it has a big impact. The inefficiency created by poor\nsupply-chain coordination costs $30B a year in the U.S. and generates\nbillions of tons of C02, mostly from trucks idling in parking lots.\nOn top of that, it has a huge impact on the lives of truck drivers,\nwho are legally limited to 11 hours of driving time each day. Waiting\nat warehouses often eats up 3-4 of those. Those wasted hours really\nadd up, making the job unsustainable for many and contributing to\nanother problem in the industry - driver turnover, which is over 90%.<p>Most of this inefficiency is caused by the high level of friction in\ncommunication between the people who manage trucks, the drivers, and\nthe people who the drivers are delivering to. The freight industry has\nmade a ton of progress with software to help manage their fleets, but\nwarehouse logistics software hasn’t caught up.<p>Chris and I were students together at Indiana University. We became\nreally interested in this space at our later jobs. I was working\nat Uber Freight (formerly Otto), and Chris was consulting for companies in\nthe industry. We were constantly amazed at how big and complex an\nissue it was, and surprised that nobody was thinking about it in the\nsame way we were. We started talking to as many people in the industry\nas possbile to figure a better way to manage logistics. The result was\nthe version of Terusama we launched with in the beginning of the year.\nWe have been since iterating on the product with a core group of\ncustomers.<p>We streamline or automate most of the repetitive and administrative\nprocesses needed to keep trucks flowing smoothly in and out of a\nfacility. We provide dispatchers at trucking companies and brokerages\na way to search through facilities, and schedule directly with\nthese facilities. When a truck driver arrives at a warehouse, we check them\nin at a kiosk. Our customers get a dashboard where they can track and\nmanage loads coming to their facility. Logistics teams get visibility\ninto their incoming trucks, the ability to communicate with drivers\nand carriers, and to track a load through its lifecycle (from staging\nthrough completion). Everyone involved is kept in the loop with smart\nnotifications. In the future, an API will make it easy for anyone with\na brokerage or trucking company to get facility availability (to feed\ninto truck routing optimization), and schedule appointments. We’ll\nalso offer services to help carriers reduce the risk of missing truck\nappointments.<p>One of the most important things we’ve learned in this time is how\nimportant reliability is for a mission-critical app. It&#x27;s obvious in\nretrospect, but it definitely changes your approach when building an\napplication - requiring heavier testing, redundancy, and support as a\nform of redundancy.<p>These days you hear a lot about things like autonomy and AI in the\nfreight industry. We believe that to get the value promised by these\nthings, we first have to upgrade the outdated technology\ninfrastructure that currently runs the industry.

We&#x27;re Jai and Sanket — founders of DeepSource (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deepsource.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deepsource.io</a>). We’re automating objective parts of code review using static analysis to ensure the code is free of common issues (anti-patterns, bug risks, performance bottlenecks, and security flaws) before a reviewer looks at it. This prevents the reviewer from having to manually point out objective issues and ensures they don’t make it to production.<p>After college, Sanket co-founded DoSelect where I joined as the first engineer. Both of us have been contributing to open-source projects for a few years then. In the beginning, we didn’t have any processes setup around code reviews. We had some IDE plugins to run the linters, and some team members used them as pre-commit hooks. We didn’t have any tests back then and used to spend too much time on some pull requests pointing out improvements and if the pull request was very large, we never reviewed it — direct merge. Then the engineering team started to grow, multiple folks started contributing to the same repositories and pull requests were often stuck for 5-7 days without any activity. To make sure the new commits are free of the common issues, we added multiple static analysis tools as part of our CI jobs. This became a pain sooner than expected as they were throwing hundreds of lines of logs in the CI and we had to fight through duplicate issues. Critical issues were hidden amongst other minor issues and false-positives, and often missed. Once a while, we tweaked the linter config files with the issues that didn’t make sense to us — to reduce noise in the CI logs. It didn’t work out after a while and we invested in a couple of commercial code quality tools but ended up disabling them as well. Their issues weren’t categorized or prioritized, analyzers were never updated with new rules, didn’t have any way to report false-positives.<p>We came across a paper — Lessons from building static analysis at Google [1]. It is a beautiful paper with the following insights: 1) Static analysis authors should focus on the developer and listen to their feedback 2) Careful developer workflow integration is key for static analysis tool adoption 3) Static analysis tools can scale by crowdsourcing analysis development.<p>We started building DeepSource in December 2018. The initial release supported Python and integrated with GitHub. Our approach was to first curate all the issues available from open-source static analysis tools, de-duplicate them, add better descriptions with external reference links — so you just add python analyzer to the `.deepsource.toml` file with some metadata (version, test patterns, exclude patterns,.) and analysis will run on every commit and pull request. To cut down the noise, we only show you newly introduced issues in the pull-request by default, based on the changeset — and not all the issues present in the changed files. We also provide a way for you to report false-positive issues directly from the dashboard. If the report is valid, we update the analyzers to resolve it within 48 - 72 hours. After this release, we started writing our own rules by walking through the Abstract Syntax Tree to find patterns. So far, we’ve 520+ types of issues in the Python analyzer. Some of the custom issues we added recently are: File opened without the `with` statement, using `yield` in comprehension instead of a generator expression, use items() to iterate over a dictionary.<p>A few months back, we released the Go analyzer and also added support for GitLab. We’re working on supporting Ruby and JavaScript and integrations for Bitbucket and Azure DevOps. The analyzers are not limited to programming languages, and we added one for Dockerfile and Terraform as well. DeepSource is free to use for open-source repositories and we make money from private repositories based on a per developer per month&#x2F;year subscription.<p>Lately, we realized some of the issues were occurring in tens of files. Though DeepSource reports them, one had to manually fix all the occurrences. We just released autofix support in Python for 15 most commonly occurring issues to start with. Autofix uses Concrete Syntax Tree to visit the issue location and make modifications in the code for which the issue is raised, and then generate a patch for that modification. When an autofix is available for an issue, you can view the suggested patch and on approval, a pull request will be created with the fixes. We&#x27;re working on improving the coverage of issues we can autofix across the analyzers we support.<p>Give us a try: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deepsource.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deepsource.io&#x2F;</a>\nHere is the documentation: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deepsource.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deepsource.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;</a><p>We would love to hear your experience using these tools and feedback&#x2F;suggestions on how can we improve!

People there prefer to use phone numbers to log in because they don’t use email and good passwords are hard to remember.<p>We come from Indonesia. Over there, in order to reach more people, mobile apps make their login easily accessible to everyone, which has resulted in the removal of emails and passwords. They made SMS based authentication a standard across sign up, login, and transactions.<p>However, SMS-based authentication comes with a security tradeoff and costs both users and businesses millions of dollars. Scammers have figured out several ways to extract verification codes via social engineering, SMS forwarding, and SIM-swapping. One of us has lost money due to SIM swapping and we&#x27;ve seen family relatives lose their digital wallet balances from social engineering. It’s easy for these scammers to extract the verification code from their target. The victims of this misconduct tend to be ride-hailers, online merchants, and other people whose income depends on mobile apps, so this issue can hit hard.<p>To address this, we&#x27;ve built a secure authentication SDK that has the convenience of only using a phone number but does not have those security drawbacks.<p>Cotter is unique in 3 ways. First, integrating with Cotter is very fast and easy - developers can provide a full-suite authentication including login, SMS one-time password, Trusted Device, Biometric, and PIN in just a few lines of code.<p>Second, Cotter works across apps&#x2F;websites, just like Google Sign-In. Once the user’s phone number is verified in one app, the user doesn’t need to re-verify their phone number again in other apps - one user does not have to be verified over and over again.<p>Third, Cotter is secure. It works like Apple’s Trusted Devices where users can only log in from a Trusted Device. It also works from within your app (no third-party authenticator app). We are following the FIDO protocol for this. Cotter’s SDK generates asymmetric keys in your device, saves the private key in secure storage, and sends the public key to Cotter&#x27;s server. Apps can choose to secure the keys using Biometric&#x2F;PIN. Every time the app requests an authentication, either for a login or for a transaction, Cotter’s SDK will send a signature using the private key that the app’s server can verify.<p>How does Cotter make money? We charge $0.02&#x2F;API call + Standard SMS Rates.<p>We would love to hear more about your experiences authenticating users!

We&#x27;ve built software to help engineering teams automate the adoption of development best practices, coding standards, and security policies.<p>When I (Shimon) was the manager of a 400-developer company&#x27;s infrastructure engineering team, we had an issue where a developer committed AWS secret keys into a public GitHub repo. We were very, very lucky that the bad actors who quickly got ahold of the keys &quot;only&quot; spun up compute instances to mine bitcoin.<p>Mistakes happen and they happen to the best of us. No developer wants to make mistakes, especially ones impacting production. Those mistakes can be not only costly to the business, but emotionally painful for the developer.<p>After finding out about the issue, I had to search for any other leaked secret in our repositories to make sure we were no longer exposed. The next thing that I had to do was to take steps to help folks avoid making this mistake again.<p>It&#x27;s easy to create a policy that says &quot;do not commit secrets to GitHub&quot; (which was what I did) but in reality, this is much harder to implement. I would do things like sending a mass email to all of Engineering and having code reviewers check for it manually during code reviews. Problem is, these approaches don&#x27;t work consistently—if at all.<p>The bigger the engineering team—and the faster it ships software—the bigger this problem becomes. Also, developers today operate more independently and have broader responsibilities; they are responsible for not just writing code, but also testing, and deployment to production. You might expect that developers would follow best practices, standards, and policies, but of course, in practice, these things fall through the cracks. That&#x27;s why we built Datree.<p>What we built is a rules engine, which is essentially a server-side git-hook platform. We connect it to the organization’s source control, scan the layout of the repository, parse all structured files like YAML &#x2F; JSON &#x2F; XML &#x2F; Dockerfile, and build a catalog with the organization’s metadata—such as packages used, container images, and all the properties in the structured files.<p>The engine performs an automatic check each time code is committed to GitHub. This happens before the code can be merged to master. It runs just like your CI tests. It checks if the rules you&#x27;ve set are followed—and tells the developer when they aren&#x27;t and how to fix it, but not like your CI configuration, Datree is running on the org level so you can apply any rule on all of your repositories in just one click.<p>You may be asking “is this another static code analysis tool?” We see Datree as completing or complementing those tools, not competing with them. We’re seeing our customers create a rule with Datree to check and verify that static code analysis step is integrated and executed as part of their CI flow, instead of going over each CI config file in their repositories and updating it manually.<p>Rules could be anything: development best practices, lessons learned from post-mortems, security policies, or compliance standards. For example, a very popular rule is to prevent secrets from being merged into the master branch. Leaking secrets to source control is a common and potentially costly mistake (see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19825202\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19825202</a>).<p>Often people ask us, “what rules should we adopt?” Because of this, we started curating industry best practices and turning them into rules they can simply enable when they use our product. Datree now comes with more than dozens of rules packs for all kinds of popular technologies (like Docker and serverless), languages and frameworks, tools (like GitHub and Travis CI), and even use cases (like SOC 2 compliance). Of course, you are free to create your own custom rules.<p>To date, Datree has run 100,000+ checks for Engineering teams large and small, including Microsoft, Globalgiving, Cybereason, and Gigster (YC S15, 400+ engineers).<p>We’re sure many HN members will have encountered similar problems and&#x2F;or have expertise in this area. We’d love to hear from you: How do you ensure the adoption of development best practices for your team? What works and doesn’t?

Marcus is a font designer while Andrey and Juho are more on the web development side of things.<p>Today, we&#x27;re launching a new monospaced font called MonoLisa (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;monolisa.dev) to the public.<p>After Marcus saw me (Juho) and Andrey working, he was curious about the fonts we use. In programming, we&#x27;re stuck with the monospaced format as code has to align to a grid in order to be readable. For a font designer, that&#x27;s an interesting constraint as you&#x27;ll have to make compromises to fit the format.<p>Roughly two months after our initial chat, Marcus came back to us with a font he called MonoLisa. It was a starting point for a collaboration results of which you see here.<p>To deal with the size constraint, Marcus did something interesting. Instead of going with the regular character width you see in monospaced fonts, he went 7% wider. The small change has implications for the design because now you can:<p>* Design characters such as m and w to be more readable.<p>* Be more careful with the space. Marcus went for a balanced design so both dark and light part of the font is roughly equal per character.<p>* Put more emphasis on terminals (the ends of a glyph) to make sure they are both distinct and they flow to each other.<p>Although the font is a little bit wider than what you might have been used to, in practice it&#x27;s not a big deal as these days displays are wider as well. I feel Marcus did a good choice there and it shaped the font and it stands as something unique compared to the others.<p>Now, after a year of effort and collaboration we&#x27;re happy to launch MonoLisa after private testing and rounds of feedback. You can test the font online and learn more about it at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;monolisa.dev.<p>Feedback is welcome (comment below or send us mail, info@monolisa.dev)- I hope you enjoy using the new typeface!","time":1583846386,"title":"Show HN: MonoLisa – A new monospaced font for devs","type":"story"},{"by":"pseudolus","descendants":209,"id":22535014,"kids":[22536121,22535976,22537674,22536207,22536407,22536093,22536215,22536218,22536519,22536128,22536839,22536528,22536389,22535953,22536620,22535798],"score":143,"time":1583845238,"title":"How coronavirus spread from patient zero in Seattle","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-03-09/how-coronavirus-spread-from-patient-zero-in-seattle"},{"by":"pseudolus","descendants":3,"id":22534985,"kids":[22540105,22541890,22546442],"score":31,"time":1583844980,"title":"A controlled trial for reproducibility","type":"story","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00672-7"},{"by":"MehranJ","descendants":3,"id":22534995,"kids":[22535965,22536751,22539112],"score":3,"text":"The title says it all.

I am posting my predictions for the coming year based on my feelings and current thoughts.<p>1. COVID-19 will be (if it isn&#x27;t already) the event that bursts the &quot;everything&quot; bubble and leads to a global economic disaster whether or not it becomes, or already is, a pandemic.  I feel that the media is misguided and may blow things out of proportion, after 9&#x2F;11 and false reports of weapons of mass destruction my trust in the media has been badly tainted.<p>2. The unfolding economic disaster will play a huge roll in the upcoming U.S. election, &quot;socialized medicine&quot; might not seem so bad, and people may begin to doubt in the strength of capitalism.  My feelings are that the unfolding events are tied to the election, that claim is not supported by any facts, and I believe that post election the economy will begin to slowly recover as people are rejuvenated with hopes and promises of vast change and reforms.<p>I think that this year is going to be a tough year, those that come out of it with a job and some savings will be able buy fruitful future investments cheap, whether it be stocks, property, or anything else.  I do not want my predictions to be true although I am generally a bit more of a pessimist than an optimist and may be why I see things the way I do.

With Savvy, you give employees tax-free funds, and let them buy any insurance they want. This has recently become possible because of a new federal regulation, which has the potential to significantly improve the healthcare situation for employees, saving them money and giving them more control.<p>For example, employers could give employees $500 a month for health benefits, and an employee could opt for a $600 health insurance plan. Both the $500 employer contribution and the $100 employee contribution would be fully tax-free.<p>We (Suril and Kevin) both worked at our own families&#x27; small businesses and know first-hand the pain of figuring out health benefits for employees. Today, small employers in the U.S. that can afford to offer health insurance (most cannot) must work with a broker to pre-select 1 or 2 &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; health plans for their employees. These are called small group health plans, and they come with some downsides.<p>Employers are in the difficult position of prying into their employees&#x27; (or co-founders&#x27;) medical histories if they want to do a good job, and they take on an HR&#x2F;benefits role that they may not want or have time for. Additionally, small group health plans come with restrictions — over 75% of employees must participate in the plan, employers must pay at least 50% of the premiums, and the company may need to be above a certain size (typically 2-5 employees).<p>These downsides, along with the cost of health insurance (more on that in a bit), mean that many small businesses simply don&#x27;t offer health benefits to their employees. This is bad for employees because they then must pay for health insurance themselves with after-tax income. This effectively means their health insurance, which is already a substantial expense, is 25 - 40% more expensive. This also makes it harder for small employers to attract good employees.<p>We are only able to launch Savvy because of new regulation that went into effect this year (on Jan 1, 2020). The vehicle we are using to offer this kind of health benefit is called the Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement (ICHRA). Outside of the industry, this new regulation has hardly received any attention, but we think it will be big.<p>Our backgrounds are in HR tech and fintech. While working on a different healthcare product a year ago, we saw the ICHRA regulation get finalized and felt that there was an opportunity to package this new benefits option into a full product that simplified health benefits for small employers.<p>The U.S. system of employer-provided healthcare, which started when wage freezes were put in place during WW2, is an anomaly among western countries. One of the biggest issues is that the buyer of health insurance (the employer) is not the consumer (the employee). This fundamentally misaligns incentives. Many small employers we speak with don&#x27;t believe employers should be making this very personal decision for their employees. We agree.<p>We guide employers through picking a contribution amount (we show them how their contribution compares to health plan prices in their area) and manage the corresponding paperwork, compliance, and payroll adjustments. For employees, we provide an in-app marketplace with access to every individual health plan, as well as vision and dental options. Employees can speak with licensed brokers every step of the way. Because employees control how they allocate their funds, they can even use the money to pay for existing insurance plans, including COBRA from a previous employer.<p>Most of our revenue comes from flat per-head administrative fees. We make a small amount of money when employees buy insurance through our in-app store, but this hasn&#x27;t been a focus for us so far since broker commissions are significantly lower for non-group plans. We think this is a good thing because it better aligns incentives for us and our customers, and we are not encouraged to favor one health plan over another based on broker commissions.<p>Most of our customers fall into four categories (#3 was an unexpected surprise for us).<p>1) Startups who want to get the tax-savings of employer provided benefits for their co-founders. Sometimes a founder will even want to keep a COBRA plan but pay for it with company funds (remember the 25-40% savings we discussed earlier). 2) Companies getting ready to make their first hire and want to offer health benefits in a fast and easy way. 3) Distributed teams who have difficulty buying a company health plan for employees spread across the country. We were surprised when a European-based company approached us, looking to offer health benefits for their U.S.-based salespeople scattered across a few different states. 4) Small businesses who have deferred the health benefits decision, and have employees who are currently paying for their own health insurance with post-tax income.<p>We&#x27;re seeing a surprising increase in signups due to coronavirus. Many startups and small businesses are scrambling to find a quick way to get their employees health coverage, and with us, their employees can get coverage even if they missed open enrollment at the beginning of the year.<p>Making it easier for employers to offer health benefits is a good start but, in the future, we want to help them get lower prices as well. We are looking into aggregating our users into buying groups to get big-company rates on insurance. Large employers receive discounts because they buy in volume. Buying groups are a very active legal topic right now — we&#x27;re following along closely.<p>If you have experience managing health benefits at your own workplace or just have thoughts on how we can make the experience better for employers or employees, please reach out!

We are Victor, Mark, and Winston, founders of Orbiter (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getorbiter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getorbiter.com</a>). \nWe monitor data in real-time to detect abnormal drops in business and product metrics. When a problem is detected, we alert teams in Slack so they never miss an issue that could impact revenue or the user experience.<p>Before Orbiter, we were product managers and data scientists at Tesla, DoorDash, and Facebook. It often felt impossible trying to keep up with the different dashboards and metrics while also actually doing work and building things. Even with tools like Amplitude, Tableau, and Google Data Studio, we would still catch real issues late by days or weeks. This led to lost revenue and bad customer experiences (i.e. angry customers who tweet Elon Musk). We couldn&#x27;t stare at dashboards all day, and we needed to quickly understand which fluctuating metrics were concerning. We also saw that our engineering counterparts had plenty of tools for passive monitoring and alerting—PagerDuty, Sentry, DataDog, etc.—but the business and product side didn’t have many. We built Orbiter to solve these problems.<p>Here’s an example: at a previous company, a number of backend endpoints were migrated which unknowingly caused a connected product feature in the Android shopping flow to disappear. Typically, users in that part of the shopping flow progress to the next page at a 70% rate but because of the missing feature, this rate dropped by 5% absolute. This was a serious issue but was hard to catch by looking at dashboards alone because: 1) this was just one number changing out of hundreds of metrics that change every hour, 2) this number naturally fluctuates daily and weekly, especially as the business grows, 3) it would have taken hours of historical data analysis to ascertain that a 5% drop was highly abnormal for that day. It wasn’t until this metric stayed depressed for many days that someone found it suspicious enough to investigate. All in, including the time to implement and deploy the fix, conversion was depressed for seven days costing more than $50K in reduced sales.<p>It can be especially challenging for the human eye to judge the severity of a changing metric; seasonality, macro trends, and sensitivity all play a role in equivocating conclusions. To solve this, we build machine learning models for your metrics that capture the normal&#x2F;abnormal patterns in the data. We use a supervised learning approach for our alerting algorithm to identify real abnormalities. Then, we forecast the expected “normal” metric value and also classify whether an abnormality should be labeled as an alert. Specifically, forecasting models identify macro-trends and seasonality patterns (e.g. this particular metric is over-indexed on Mondays and Tuesdays relative to other days of the week). Classifier models determine the likelihood of true positives based on historical patterns. Each metric has an individual sensitivity threshold that we tune with our customers so the alerting conditions catch real issues without being overly noisy. Models are re-trained weekly and we take user feedback on alerts to update the model and improve accuracy over time.<p>Some of our customers are startups with sparse data. In these cases, it can be challenging to build a high-confidence model. What we do instead is work with our customers to define manual settings for “guardrails” that trigger alerts. For example, “Alert me if this metric falls below 70%!” or “Alert me if this metric drops more than 5% week over week”. As our customers grow and their datasets grow, we can apply greater intelligence to their monitoring by moving over to the automated modeling approach.<p>We made Orbiter so that it&#x27;s easy for non-technical teams to set-up and use. It’s a web app, requires no eng development, and connects to existing analytics databases the same way that existing dashboard tools like Looker or a SQL editor just plug in. Teams connect their Slack to Orbiter so they get immediate notifications when a metric changes abnormally.<p>We anticipate that the HN community has members, teammates, or friends who are product managers, businesspeople, or data scientists that might have the problems we experienced. We’d love for you and them to give Orbiter a spin. Most importantly, we’d love to hear your feedback!

They set up an emergency &quot;online teaching&quot; teacher training day tues, e-learning resources, and upon closure on thursday they had the elearning setup for students to try out.  You can see the district emergency e-learning portal page here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nsd.org&#x2F;northshorelearns<p>My 2 kids classes will be taught using Google Classrooms starting Monday, and the last two days were for &quot;testing&quot; the system.  The school choose Google Classrooms I think because the students already had google apps for education accounts.<p>Overall, Google Classrooms is better than nothing, but honestly not much.  It&#x27;s basically a Teacher driven CRM system with ui complexity like all google web tools, and some integration with Google Docs.   I think this might be fine for middle-school or higher, but they workflows are a bit convoluted, and I can see small kids and computer illiterate parents having serious problems navigating.<p>The biggest problem though, is that it&#x27;s all self-directed learning.  Students need to proactively seek out their assignments and course materials and have the focus to read&#x2F;understand it all without any explanation by a teacher.  It&#x27;s &quot;okay&quot; in my case because I can spend the time to hover over them to make sure the work gets done and the content gets read (otherwise it&#x27;s just skimmed over).  Students unable to self learn and parents unable to micromanage their learning are going to be severely hurt by online learning like this.   Also, me micromanaging the kids took a considerable chunk of the day, as I need to check up on them every 10 minutes or so, or they have questions (aprox 5hrs&#x2F;day).<p>I do think the school district made the right decision to close.

Perhaps that is expected, perhaps we are at the perfect way to communicate with each other online, but I&#x27;m interested to know if there are some innovative takes on online communication and discussion. Here are some standout examples of what we currently have:<p>* Guestbook: Probably one of the earliest forms of online discussion. A single list of replies on a page.<p>* Message boards: Top level thread with sequential replies, usually paginated. These get cumbersome after a few pages, and for busy threads with hundreds of pages, almost all of the content in the middle gets lost<p>* Facebook &#x2F; Instagram: A top level post with a mess of replies that on Facebook can be sorted by relevant, on Instagram I&#x27;m not sure can even be sorted, just load more infinitely. I think these examples show really poor execution of online discussion yet are still immensely popular<p>* Twitter: Twitter has probably the most conversational style for non-live communication. Tweets can be replied to with tweets which can be replied to, nested conversation chains. Jumping into the middle of one of these discussion gives you context by also showing you the previous 1 or 2 tweets.<p>* IRC: Grandfather of chat rooms. Join a room, chat in real time, leave<p>* Slack + Discord: Evolving chat rooms with reactions, persistence, a nice user interface - and for Slack threaded replies which are an interesting addition - but somewhat unmanageable with many responses","time":1583533418,"title":"Ask HN: Unique Takes on Online Discussion","type":"story"},{"by":"sxcurry","descendants":2,"id":22507863,"kids":[22507912,22508235,22508549],"score":20,"time":1583533085,"title":"South by Southwest Cancelled","type":"story","url":"https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/03/06/sxsw-coronavirus-canceled-austin-texas-festival-2020/4978787002/"},{"by":"klohto","descendants":108,"id":22507809,"kids":[22509280,22508558,22509033,22510332,22508584,22508548,22508545,22508763,22508547,22511359,22508396,22508759,22509749,22509020,22511251,22508465,22510286,22508730,22509238],"score":276,"time":1583532608,"title":"A googol-to-one gear ratio [video]","type":"story","url":"https://www.kottke.org/20/03/heres-what-a-googol-to-one-gear-ratio-looks-like"},{"by":"ceejayoz","descendants":46,"id":22507764,"kids":[22508296,22507969,22508080,22507953,22508041,22508033,22507948,22508172,22507998,22508094,22508449,22507942,22508828,22508051,22507934],"score":76,"time":1583532268,"title":"City of Austin Cancels SXSW March Events","type":"story","url":"https://www.sxsw.com/2020-event-update/"},{"by":"Lagogarda","descendants":6,"id":22507744,"kids":[22507858,22507860,22507962,22507823,22507855],"score":38,"time":1583532089,"title":"SXSW 2020 canceled due to coronavirus","type":"story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/6/21162247/sxsw-2020-cancelled-coronavirus-austin-texas-virus-fears-public-health-event"},{"by":"sndean","descendants":3,"id":22507584,"kids":[22507987,22511205],"score":16,"time":1583530784,"title":"The U.S. May Already Be in a Recession","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-06/the-u-s-may-already-be-in-a-recession-thanks-to-coronavirus"},{"by":"Shivetya","descendants":126,"id":22507605,"kids":[22507996,22508554,22508058,22507979,22508304,22507957,22507653,22511609,22512848,22508608,22508002,22508070,22510009,22508624,22507873,22509473,22511656,22512729,22507825,22508091],"score":113,"time":1583530959,"title":"Torture prevalent, effective in popular movies, study finds","type":"story","url":"https://www.ua.edu/news/2020/01/torture-prevalent-effective-in-popular-movies-study-finds/"},{"by":"LinuxBender","descendants":5,"id":22507473,"kids":[22510667,22509358,22508034,22507945],"score":8,"time":1583530035,"title":"Command-line program to download videos from YouTube.com and other video sites","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl"},{"by":"vo2maxer","descendants":5,"id":22507530,"kids":[22508076,22510389,22508026],"score":21,"time":1583530459,"title":"FCC to require anti-robocall tech after “voluntary” plan didn’t work out","type":"story","url":"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/03/ajit-pai-follows-congress-instructions-requires-new-anti-robocall-tech/"},{"by":"tannercollin","descendants":14,"id":22507501,"kids":[22513733,22520114,22507700,22507523,22511926,22516585,22532660,22524212,22512669,22514345,22507587],"score":25,"time":1583530284,"title":"Show HN: isEven API – tell if a number is even SaaS","type":"story","url":"https://isevenapi.xyz/"},{"by":"johnblood","descendants":12,"id":22507114,"kids":[22507462,22508166,22507218,22512639,22508720,22514974,22507499,22511543],"score":7,"text":"I just started learning Ruby as my first language.

All these algorithms benefit from recent breakthroughs in academia and a generous open-source community. However, in order to be deployed to the real world, they require a custom set of training data to learn and understand the language unique to each industry. Therefore, people around the world are meticulously labeling data samples.<p>Example sentence: <i>London is the capital and largest city of England and of the United Kingdom.</i><p>Labels: “London” —&gt; “capital”, “United Kingdom”<p>Labels: “London” —&gt; “largest city”, “England”<p>In the last few years I’ve worked at companies such as Apple and Yahoo and noticed that many organizations tend to reinvent the wheel when creating labeling interfaces for their labelers. Some companies still do this work in Excel.\nWe saw an opportunity to create a &quot;single interface to rule them all&quot; - to handle all sorts of text labeling tasks.<p>We leverage existing NLP capabilities to intelligently validate the quality of labels in a document and complement human judgment. Furthermore, we already understand terms like “Starbucks” and “New York” - why spend time labeling these terms from scratch every time? We created an API so you can plug in existing models to apply a first pass on labeling the document. We also built many other extensions to help labelers optimize their time - a “find and label” extension for labeling repetitive terms, a dictionary extension for quickly looking up unfamiliar terms. We spent the past year building out the labeling solution I wish I could have used.<p>We now handle named entity recognition, parts of speech, document labeling, coreference resolution (multiple words referring to the same object&#x2F;person) and dependency parsing (drawing relationships between words). A case study with one of our clients shows 70% improved labeling efficiency upon adopting the Datasaur platform, and we have much more room to improve.<p>We also spoken with 100+ AI teams globally and identified the best practices in labeling. In addition to providing an enhanced interface, we can help track labeler performance, peer disagreement scores, and detect&#x2F;remove labeler bias. By incorporating and encoding these features into our software, we can not only help improve the labeling efficiency but also improve the quality of the data and therefore the resulting AI model.<p>We believe that as AI becomes ever more prevalent and ubiquitous, labeling will become an increasingly important task. AI is a garbage-in, garbage-out technology, and the quantity and quality of data can often make a critical difference in the resulting AI model. We’re really excited to open Datasaur up to the world today and hear your feedback. Have you run into similar labeling issues?

The initial dataset I was planning to use was Google street views for larger cities and their satellite towns.<p>My question is, as a lean bootstrapped idea, what services are available to me in order to help label data that won&#x27;t break the bank?
