organize tasks in a natural way by using only tags and mentions, all in a single box.<p>Ambra removes the necessity of having multiple fields for creating a task – there is one single box to rule them all. We empower writing tasks naturally.<p>Defining a fully descriptive task in traditional tools is not a simple process. You’ve to start writing the task title, description, and additional form fields for task status, priority, assignee, etc. It means there are some ceremonies to be followed.<p>Working for many years with different remote and office teams, I saw that every team develops its own ubiquitous language. This is more emphasized especially when it comes to daily tasks description language. This level of understanding helps the project team to communicate quickly while eliminating inaccuracies and contradictions; and that’s an attribute of a – smart team.<p>Describing a task in a natural way using one single box, without the need for multiple form fields, makes the task data entry process trivial and helps the team focus on delivering – what’s most important for an agile team – values.<p>A flat team is responsible enough to focus on productivity and move the tasks to #done.  However, they should have a proper tool to achieve that – that’s where Ambra comes.<p>An example: Hey @ troy we need #todo a #presentation of the website to the customer #urgent. You immediately know the status of the task, who&#x27;s in charge for and when it&#x27;s needed.<p>Ambra is offered as freemium, you can go now and create your first project, invite your teammates, or just start assigning tasks to yourself and feel the simplicity.<p>We love to hear your feedback.","time":1604572410,"title":"Show HN: Ambra – Task Management Reinvented","type":"story"},{"by":"rbanffy","descendants":45,"id":24997018,"kids":[25003822,25004516,25004115,25005445,25011699,25003821,25003323],"score":59,"time":1604571398,"title":"The Allure of Supercavitating Torpedoes","type":"story","url":"https://www.naval-technology.com/features/featurethe-allure-of-supercavitating-torpedoes-5838643/"},{"by":"dt3ft","descendants":11,"id":24996958,"kids":[24997156,24997351,24996988,24997562],"score":4,"text":"Ransomware is a major risk, and it keeps evolving to avoid detection from antivirus tools or operating systems.<p>But what if the Operating System manufacturers developed a technique where modifications to data on a disk drive exceeding x storage measurement units per time unit triggers an alarm?<p>Let&#x27;s think of it in terms of physical warehouse.\nIf someone walks into your warehouse and begins to flip every box on every shelf upside down, you would not just stand by and watch it happen.

I did a little bit of looking and found a few options like rescuetime but after trying it out I found it was hard to track time because I had to have the application open while using apps&#x2F;software on my laptop and phone. I knew about screen time but was unaware that it was also available on macOS. When I found this out I thought that I had found my solution to tracking my time. However apple screen time lacks a lot of features and is quite limited. For example there is no way to look at weekly or monthly trends, the categories are unable to be changed, and I can&#x27;t access data from more than a month ago. In addition, when I select the metrics for all devices they differ on my iphone and mac. I was hoping that I could just download the data and create a better visualization&#x2F;user interface, however I could not find any easy way to do this. I can&#x27;t think of why Apple would not be able to allow this data to be downloaded if they are not willing to create a better screen time feature. This data should be accessible to the user especially if there are no third party alternatives that can accurately track screen time.","time":1604545357,"title":"Why can't we download data from screen time feature on Apple devices?","type":"story"},{"by":"cinquemb","descendants":81,"id":24995318,"kids":[24996416,24996460,24996266,24996873,24996156,24996249,24997141,24996333],"score":118,"time":1604545696,"title":"Prestige in US Today","type":"story","url":"https://www.overcomingbias.com/2020/11/what-makes-prestige.html"},{"by":"saeranv","descendants":237,"id":24995315,"kids":[24995491,24995517,24995482,24995425,24995464,24995949,24995679,24995837,24995606,24995808,24995752,24998812,24996350,25001086,24995639,24995975,24995734,24995981,24995624,24995495,24995481,24995420,24995733,24995417,24995537,24995462,24995434,24996162,24995707],"score":143,"time":1604545685,"title":"The polls messed up","type":"story","url":"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/11/04/dont-kid-yourself-the-polls-messed-up-and-that-would-be-the-case-even-wed-forecasted-biden-losing-florida-and-only-barely-winning-the-electoral-college/"},{"by":"bookofjoe","descendants":3,"id":24995206,"kids":[24996124,24995642],"score":17,"time":1604543979,"title":"Scientist who vacuumed murder hornets braces for fight","type":"story","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/31/us-murder-hornets-nest-asian-giant"},{"by":"ngcc_hk","dead":true,"id":24995132,"kids":[24995145,24995146],"score":2,"time":1604543194,"title":"Why no discussion about the halt of largest tech-cum-fin IPO (Ant Group)?","type":"story"},{"by":"niviachanta","dead":true,"id":24995079,"kids":[24995252,24995383],"score":12,"time":1604542518,"title":"Fracking Reduces CO2 Emissions","type":"story","url":"https://www.soapboxproject.org/journal/interview-with-fracking-expert-alexandria-shrake"},{"by":"startupcheckr","dead":true,"id":24995052,"kids":[24999370,24996292,24996513],"score":29,"time":1604542212,"title":"Online business tools for startups and entrepreneurs","type":"story","url":"https://www.startupcheckr.com"},{"by":"polm23","descendants":5,"id":24995853,"kids":[25005577,25005166,25004612],"score":17,"time":1604553355,"title":"In Search of the Philosopher's Keyboard","type":"story","url":"https://www.dampfkraft.com/philosophers-keyboard.html"},{"by":"stopachka","descendants":18,"id":24994860,"kids":[24997314,25044775,24996244,24996084,24997425,24996785,24997366,25008256,24998215,24999748,24996360,24999428,24997209,24996629,24998599,25005108],"score":28,"text":"Hey team, what essays have you gotten back to over and over again?

Sunsama is a daily planner for busy folks. Each day, Sunsama walks you through a guided daily planning process that helps you create a calm, focused, and intentional plan for the day. Sunsama pulls together your calendar, emails, and tasks from other SaaS tools into a single place.<p>Travis and I started building products in the calendar and productivity space a couple years after graduating and working our first jobs. The idea that we were going to spend the next 40 years behind computers, working, and that Outlook or Google calendar would be the best way for us to be thoughtful and intentional with what we did at work felt unacceptable.<p>Before Sunsama, we built, launched, and shut down six different products in this space over the course of four years. I’ll spare you the postmortem on each failure but my favorite boondoggle was the first product we built. We tried to build a “social network for time” (think Calendly meets LinkedIn). In retrospect, it was doomed because it wasn’t something we needed ourselves nor did we have a real user in mind, we just thought that “networking calendars” would be an interesting problem to solve. After shipping this and learning that no one wanted it, we just kept frankensteining our software from one pivot to another, mostly unsuccessfully. In one of our last pivots before Sunsama as it is today we hit a breaking point when our biggest customer churned and we realized we only had a few months of runway. It was a gut punch because we felt we’d finally run out of “if we just change &lt;blank&gt;, this will definitely work” ideas.<p>This time, instead of frankensteining our idea, we took a step back and started fresh. Luckily, all the products we built were calendar&#x2F;productivity related and over the years we’d talked to thousands of users and customers about their calendars, their work tools, and how they went about their work day. This intuition and expertise for how people work coupled with a fresh perspective got us to the realization that everyone started the day by asking themselves &quot;what am I going to do today?&quot; but answering that question was difficult and there wasn’t a great place to answer it. The calendar works well for planning meetings but is too clunky for heads down work. Project management tools work well for documenting all the work a team might do over long periods of time but it&#x27;s stressful to look at hundreds of Jira tickets when you just want to work on a couple of them today. Text lists or written notes are flexible but don&#x27;t connect back to the actual source of work. And simply keeping a mental list seems to break down once your job becomes sufficiently busy or ambitious.<p>So we decided to build a calendar + daily todo list for people who function on a hybrid of a maker and manager&#x27;s schedule (to use Paul Graham’s terminology).<p>We’re excited to officially launch on HackerNews now that product is self service! It took us a while to get to this point as we originally started out as a product with a concierge onboarding (a la Superhuman).<p>Right now, we integrate with Google Calendar, Gmail, Asana, Github, Jira, Todoist and Trello. In the future, we hope to add more integrations and open up signups to folks who use those tools as well! We&#x27;d love your feedback on how it feels to plan out a workday with Sunsama!","time":1604505996,"title":"Launch HN: Sunsama (YC W19) – Daily Planner for Busy

Instead, one idea I really like in k is how the database is the programming environment.<p>The standard e.g. python + postgres setup suffers from having the data wanting to live in 2 places: in the db for long term storage and in your application memory, for manipulation&#x2F;research. So you end up marshalling data to-and-fro, writing boring code dealing with the subtleties of slightly different types in python vs postgres. Maybe you even try using an ORM, which comes with a host of problems. You also have the problem of not knowing exactly where to put business logic; usually, if it can he expressed as a constraint on a table, it should leave in the database. But that&#x27;s not always the case, so you end up putting some stuff in the client code.<p>In q&#x2F;kdb, the database and your application process are the same. It&#x27;s a joy to naturally interspread q-sql with q code - it&#x27;s the kind of step change that maked you wonder how were you managing before discovering it.<p>The closest I&#x27;ve come to reproducing this is with pandas + storing csvs on disk, but this has a couple of problems:<p>1. Pandas syntax is, let&#x27;s be honest, a hack. They&#x27;re doing their best, but they have to comply with python syntax rules. You also have like 50 different date and time types. The table index is either useless or actively getting in the way most of the time (and I could go on).<p>2. Using csvs is also a hack.

I think everything about it is backwards and it needs to be thrown out and started from scratch.<p>Since March, I&#x27;ve been building a movement around what I&#x27;m calling Modular Learning- an approach that&#x27;s really personalized, really flexible, really involves families in the learning process and very much nurtures children&#x27;s natural curiosity and love of learning - in a nutshell, a more holistic and child-centered approach that allows for total flexibility and personalization.<p>I&#x27;ve been hosting workshops for thousands of parents and kids impacted by school closures on issues ranging from communication with children to curriculum planning, food, financial security and talking to kids about racism.<p>I&#x27;m now working closely with a group of 20 families (mostly in tech) with kids ages 3-12 in personalizing their children&#x27;s education through a combination of 1-1 instruction, social-emotional learning, electives and parenting workshops, closely measuring how kids perform in a parent-driven approach. We&#x27;ve also written hundreds of blogs on  the best curriculum and apps for parents to support their children&#x27;s learning. based on their learning styles.<p>I need to find a co-founder who can share this big vision with me and has really bold and smart ideas on using technology to scale something like this, and of course is at a stage where they&#x27;d be excited about taking on a project of this magnitude.<p>Anyone interested?<p>If so, email me at manisha@modulo.app","time":1604418762,"title":"Anyone want to build a new public education system with

end up on projects that stall and slowly fail. The goal is clear, but no one knows how to get there. Stakeholders are more concerned with keeping a slowly deteriorating status quo. My role is described to me as &quot;ripping things out,&quot; but no one  wants to risk ripping anything out. How do I learn to identify these projects early? They are bad for my career and they&#x27;re also very stressful.<p>I am &quot;in charge of&quot; a large installation of our products at a customer site. I have a team of five that gets whittled down to two. A big restack has been in planning for a long time when I join the team. I realize that we aren&#x27;t ready to migrate. It&#x27;s not clear how we can get any more ready. The installation is set up with many opaque plugins of unknown provenance. We don&#x27;t know what they do or how many users rely on them. We are afraid to ask the customer about what features they use, because we can&#x27;t give the impression that we don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;re doing. We don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;re doing. We go through the motions of planning the migration and repeatedly postpone it. Nothing is done by the time I leave the project.<p>I&#x27;m tasked with rewriting a big feature on top of a beta plugin framework. The feature is threaded chaotically throughout the application and comes in a dozen variations and code paths. No one seems to know what some code paths do. Several features no longer seem to be in active use. No one can say what&#x27;s important to keep. The PM says the rewrite should keep all existing functionality and be invisible to end users. After months of dead ends, I obtain an internal transfer.<p>An employer wants me to fix some data pipelines. They have been missing SLAs by days and weeks. The pipelines are flaky because different parts are owned by different teams, and each has reserved the right to pull the ripcord, because the current setup shields them from the risk of shipping a broken result. The aggregate effect is that nothing ever gets released.

I used it quite a bit back in the day. It is implemented in old-school FORTRAN. By old-school, I mean a FORTRAN that only had computed IF statements, as in<p>IF (X) 3,4,5<p>which means<p>if x&lt;0 then goto 3\nif x=0 then goto 4\nif x&gt;0 then goto 5<p>This is a listing of a punched-card deck. Columns 73-80 are sequentially numbered so that, if you dropped your card deck, you could sort the cards by those columns. The increment per-line is 100 so the numbers are 00000100, 00000200, 00000300, etc. This allows new cards to be put in between existing cards while maintaining the sort sequence, e.g. 00000150.<p>This program is a work of beauty. Many of the statements have numeric labels so they can be reached by GOTO or computed IF statements. This programmer chose the label numbers so they are in ascending order (so you know where to look for a jump target). They are 4 digit labels where the left-most digit is the main task (e.g. handle recursive function calling), the next digit is a subtask within the main task, etc.<p>The FORTRAN function names mirror the intended LISP names, e.g. CAR, CDR, etc. so it is clear to a LISP programmer what the semantics will be. The call stack is named STACK, etc.<p>Every grouping has a comment line (character in column 1), e.g.<p>C    EVALUATE THE FUNCTION<p>I am typing in the source code so I can share it with the LISP history site. Something this beautiful deserves to be preserved. This programmer is an artist.<p>Read source code.

That&#x27;s good news, it shows that America has a president that values freedom of speech. Yet freedom is threaten by the corrupt media and tech companies that silence Democrat critics and cover up corruption scandals. Courtesy of the corrupt media, Biden has been able to hide and duck questions the entire campaign like no other presidential candidate in history. When Biden is asked tough questions disaster ensues. The real threat to freedom of speech is not vicious questions, but collusion. If you value freedom, you must vote in this presidential election. Ronald Reagan once said: &quot;Never take freedom for granted because it&#x27;s never more than one generation away from extinction&quot;.<p>Besides freedom, here are other factors to consider before choosing between Biden or Trump:<p>* Joe Biden seems to have a hard time working a full day, and has deteriorated mentally in quite famous and significant ways. Evidently, he is physically and mentally incapable of handling such a demanding job as the presidency.<p>* Biden lies often and without regret. In the last presidential debate (watched by millions of people) he falsely denied his statements on banning fracking.<p>Trump has delivered on most of his campaign proposals, always putting America first. Don&#x27;t vote for Biden just because you don&#x27;t like Trump. That is just stupid.<p>Trump administration built the strongest economy in 50 years with democrats and the media fighting them all the way. Low record of unemployment for all. Trump has made America great again. A strong America is good news for anyone that values freedom. As John F. Kennedy said: &quot;America must be determined to be first, and when we are strong, and we are first, then freedom gains, and the prospect for peace and security increase&quot;.

Each extension can add more functionality. For example, there&#x27;s an extension that lets you search in NPM packages, another extension lets you search in StackOverflow, another lets you connect your cloud platform and search in your infrastructure, another in your company internal docs, etc. There aren&#x27;t any ads, SEO, content marketing, tracking, or personalized content.

But after covid they decided they were pulling out of all their investments outside of their core business area, and we are outside of their core business.\nWe signed the debt version of a KISS, and we are wondering if this entitles them to actually get their money back. Our lawyers at the time told us it was not the case, but with the current situation we want to be completely sure.

A few months ago I started building a small side project to solve a problem that I found interesting. I hit a wall eventually and figured I may be able to speed up my progress if I spoke to someone with more industry knowledge. I spoke to some family who put me in contact with the CEO of a relatively successful company in this field who would be willing to lend an ear to my questions as a personal favour to my family member. Over the course of several weeks we built up a great relationship and further developed this little side-project as well as discussed some of his ideas on ways to further innovate in the industry.<p>To cut a long story short; he offered €200k in funding to quit my job and co-found a seperate business with him and two of his existing employees. The investment is interest free and can be reduced by €40k per year. The funding is being offered in a personal capacity and is not coming out of his existing company. There will be a 25% equity split four ways with the goal of further developing some of the ideas we have discussed to date.<p>Myself and one other employee will split the funding as salaries (totalling 1.4 years of runway). I will be the technical arm of the business. The other paid employee will be dedicated fulltime to providing information from within the industry to fill gaps in my knowledge and leverage his extensive network. The CEO and the final member will act as executives in the company (CEO and Chairman) and will work to get the business profitable as quickly as possible.<p>Broadly; what can I do in these extremely early stages that set will set the business on a trajectory for success? I plan on seeking a start-up mentor that I can regularly check in with - is this a good idea?

I&quot;m quite passionate about any job so it hurts my mental state to having to fight BS while spending the day busy doing unchallenging work. I&#x27;m looking for advise on how you came across dealing with being in bad jobs especially with covid. Also interested to know if you are currently facing the same issue and how you are tackling it.<p>I do recognize there are obviously some underlying issues at play here, I do feel like I&#x27;m unable to make a change in life in general sometimes.<p>Here are some thoughts I have,<p>1. Keep going at the current job and keep looking on the side.<p>Problem I have here is I don&#x27;t want to place too much mental pressure on doing well at the job and committing to interviews and job searching. So this mean I likely continue to show a lack of commitment regarding to studying interviews&#x2F;applying, making finding a good job a very long process<p>2. Leave the job, take time off to focus on new opportunities&#x2F;learning&#x2F;covid break.<p>I don&#x27;t have an issue with supporting myself for many years. I took a lot of risks when i was younger however now I&#x27;m now in my 30s, more cautious, and do fear unstability and judgement. So I do not know if I have a good enough reason to do this. Specifically I haven&#x27;t been showing consistency in focusing on studying&#x2F;job. Also I&#x27;m concerned if i can use all my free time effectively, If covid didn&#x27;t exists, it would be easier to find more purposeful things to do part time while job searching (volunteering, working on friendships&#x2F;relationships)<p>3. Do nothing, practice Stoicism<p>I think this is what I&#x27;m doing most of the weeks, trying ignoring the BS issues&#x2F;people, focus on day to day tasks, staying focused on getting through isolation and letting time pass. However I know the job situation  won&#x27;t get better on its own for the next year at least.<p>Thanks,","time":1604120118,"title":"Ask HN: How to best move away from an unpleasant job?","type":"story"},{"by":"mprime1","descendants":5,"id":24949303,"kids":[24949398,24949491,24949822,24958765],"score":3,"text":"I started to download some private thoughts and notes in a public bare GitHub repo.<p>I find it a good storage medium for some of my notes, bookmarks, lists.\nAnd has benefits such as being able to simply link to my thoughts rather than composing the n-th email about the same subject.<p>Over time I also want to throw in code i have laying around, host my CV and maybe make it my homepage.<p>Is this a thing people do?

We&#x27;re building a better data science notebook.<p>As an engineer, I spent most of my time working on developer tools, building IDEs, and studying human-computer interaction. I helped build a couple of startups, I built tools for JavaScript development, and worked on Firefox DevTools. But once I started to work with data scientists, all those code editors and IDEs that I knew as a software engineer suddenly stopped being the right tool for the job. Notebooks were.<p>Notebooks as we know them today have many pain points (versioning, reproducibility, collaboration). They don&#x27;t work well with other tools. They don&#x27;t exactly encourage best practices. But none of these are fundamental flaws of the notebook paradigm. They are signs of a new computational medium. Much like spreadsheets in the 1980s.<p>Two years ago, my co-founders and I started to think about a better data science notebook. Deepnote is built on top of the Jupyter ecosystem. We are using the same format, and we intend to remain fully compatible in both directions. But to solve the above problems, we&#x27;ve introduced significant changes.<p>First, we made collaboration a first-class citizen. To allow for this, Deepnote runs in the cloud by default. Every Deepnote notebook is easily shareable (like Google Docs) and easy to understand even by non-technical users.<p>Second, we completely redesigned the interface to encourage best practices, write clean code, define dependencies, and create reproducible notebooks. We also built a really good autocomplete system, and added a variable explorer.<p>Third, we made Deepnote easy to integrate with other services. We didn&#x27;t want to build another data science platform where people work with an iframed notebook. We want to build an amazing notebook that plays well with other services, databases, ML platforms, and the Jupyter ecosystem.<p><i></i>Check out a 2-min demo here:<i></i> <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;b7e05ecca78047c2a2f687d77be8ecea\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;b7e05ecca78047c2a2f687d77be8ecea</a><p>Building a new computational medium is hard. It takes time. Today, we&#x27;re launching a public beta of Deepnote. Not everything works yet. Some pieces are missing.

everyone! Yunyu, Rahul, and Jason here. We&#x27;re co-founders of Cohere (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cohere.so\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cohere.so</a>), which lets you see what your users are seeing on your web app and remote control their browser with their permission. This requires zero setup on their part, which is particularly helpful for less tech-savvy users.<p>Pointing things out over Zoom screenshare is highly time consuming (&quot;click the 4th checkbox on the right&quot;, &quot;click the handle and drag&quot;), and trying to figure out what users are doing over a live chat or phone call typically leads to endlessly frustrating back-and-forths.<p>When COVID forced all of us into remote work, we found ourselves spending a lot of time in screensharing sessions. We were tired of choppy frame rates and blurry text, and realized that we could get around this by sharing the user’s screen in a different way. Rather than video streaming, which is how it’s usually done, we could send over diffs of their webpage’s DOM representation and reapply those in the viewer’s browser – this is similar to how virtual DOM frameworks like React work.<p>We first used this technique for an earlier project (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23363250\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23363250</a>) that rendered React apps on the server (a Node equivalent of Phoenix LiveView). This reduces development complexity for web apps by completely eliminating the need for RPC layers (REST, GraphQL) – for instance, you&#x27;d be able to write to the database directly from your React component and share state across sessions with a single hook. It works by sending DOM updates from the server (e.g. insert a node, change an attribute) in response to input actions sent from the client (e.g. click a button, type a character).<p>This approach uses significantly less bandwidth compared to traditional\nscreen sharing solutions, and gives us a semantic understanding of the webpage (e.g. a button is sent over as a &lt;button &#x2F;&gt;, instead of a blob of bytes). As a result, we can selectively filter out sensitive content and allow viewers to scroll and type on the webpage without any perceived latency.<p>To solve our screen sharing problem, we initially built a Chrome extension that let users browse web pages collaboratively. During YC, we saw that our early adopters were primarily using this tool to walk through their own web apps with their customers, so we decided to refocus the product towards helping companies onboard and support their users.<p>Because we&#x27;re focused on the real time use case, we only record the DOM when a session is being viewed. This means that no data is sent to our servers unless Cohere is actively being used. Additionally, we don’t persist or retain any session data.<p>Thanks for reading our story – we&#x27;d love to get your thoughts, feedback, and ideas!","time":1603978413,"title":"Launch HN: Cohere (YC S20) – Real-time user support for web apps","type":"story"},{"by":"vincent_s","descendants":3,"id":24930256,"kids":[24930319,24930467,24930283],"score":4,"time":1603978321,"title":"Governments May Make Private Gold Ownership Illegal","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-20/odey-says-governments-may-make-private-gold-ownership-illegal"},{"by":"tambourine_man","descendants":71,"id":24930085,"kids":[24930228,24930809,24933582,24937160,24938860,24932563,24932803,24937216,24941919,24931566,24931404,24930315,24931742,24933415,24931097,24930487,24931001,24934755],"score":241,"time":1603976983,"title":"Vim-Mario: Mario on Vim","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/rbtnn/vim-mario"},{"by":"wallflower","descendants":30,"id":24930071,"kids":[24938734,24938988,24938965],"score":85,"time":1603976897,"title":"Cecilia Chiang, SF chef who brought authentic Chinese food to US, dies at 100","type":"story","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/10/28/cecilia-chang-sf-chef-who-brought-authentic-chinese-food-to-us-dies-at-100/"},{"by":"headalgorithm","descendants":29,"id":24930074,"kids":[24941361,24941368,24941178,24941315,24941291,24942500,24941141,24941202,24945604,24950808],"score":18,"time":1603976916,"title":"How Do We Prevent War in Space?","type":"story","url":"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-do-we-prevent-war-in-space/"},{"by":"Borkdude","descendants":8,"id":24929993,"kids":[24931235,24937255],"score":123,"time":1603976278,"title":"Show HN: Grasp – grep Clojure code using clojure.spec regexes","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/borkdude/grasp"},{"by":"chrisshroba","descendants":5,"id":24929956,"kids":[24930115,24929965,24930034,24930088,24930267],"score":6,"text":"The last thread like this is from 2009 and I thought it&#x27;d be interesting to see where y&#x27;all are from.

Think of us as an on-demand podcast studio you can focus on anything you want. We set you up with an interviewer in our marketplace, and we make the process easy, from scheduling to hosting interviews over the phone, and then delivering a polished edit that wouldn’t sound out of place on the radio.<p>Our idea was born out of a personal sense of loss: My grandfather passed away and I found myself regretting that I hadn’t captured him telling stories about his life. I thought others might feel the same about someone in their own lives.<p>The problem (for me, anyway) was that I didn’t have an easy way to go deep with my grandfather. It was never the right time. Some of the questions I wanted to ask were quite personal. I don’t have audio editing skills, so I was unsure what I would even do with the raw audio if I’d recorded a conversation with him.<p>I mentioned what I wanted to do to my friend, George, who’s a journalist. He stopped me and said, “But that’s what journalists do. Why don’t you hire a journalist?”<p>We decided to try it as an experiment. My Aunt Cindy was about to turn 59, so George called up three of her oldest friends, interviewed them about their relationships with Cindy, and delivered an edit that, when Cindy heard it, had her laughing and crying in equal measure.<p>Cindy and her friends told us three things that we have since heard over and over: First, customers often tell our interviewers things they’ve never told their loved ones, but would like to be able to say to them (example - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;CDlwIojFPmF&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;CDlwIojFPmF&#x2F;</a>). Second, we routinely hear from recipients that, as soon as they&#x27;ve heard an episode in which people talk about them, they want to call those people and thank them. And third, that the experience is helping people feel closer to each other.<p>But the truth is that we would have only ever been a cottage production studio with George and me at the helm (that’s right, my friend George became a co-founder). This is where Moncef Biaz and Martin Gouy, our technical co-founders, enter the picture. Together, as a team, we think about Artifact as a marketplace, connecting the right interviewers with the right guests (e.g., if you need a bilingual Mandarin and English-speaking interviewer who is also great with 11-year-olds, we got you.) We’ve also become obsessed with the state of audio recording and editing technology, effectively asking the question: &quot;How close can we get to studio-quality sound without the studio?&quot; The answer is: pretty darn close.<p>Far more important than the audio quality is the substance of what people are telling our interviewers. Our customers are telling us that these incredibly personal stories are becoming heirlooms for their friends and family. Customers are also teaching us new ways to use our service: wedding and anniversary gifts, family heritage, journaling, enterprise use-cases, etc.<p>We put lots of little snippets (with permission from our customers) on our Instagram.

We do the hard work of tying up with legacy financial institutions so that developers can integrate their desired APIs and launch.<p>Think of us like Plaid+Synapse for the Asian subcontinent where the regulatory complexity, financial intricacies, and local knowledge inhibit the foreign infrastructure players from operating.<p>This is my second fintech venture, and I started Decentro out of my own pain point. In 2015, we had launched a fintech venture called &#x27;Mypoolin&#x27; in the domain of social payments, ran it for three years, and then sold it to a global payments company that eventually got acquired by PayU in 2019.<p>Throughout those five years across the organizations, we saw it first hand that integrations with banks and old-school institutions were extremely painful across all stages and categories. The average time span for API integrations with any bank ranges from 4 to 6 months or more depending on the type and complexity of the use case.<p>Our product roadmap is a function of the core-building blocks of any fintech company. First came KYC&#x2F;KYB and digital onboarding, enabling companies to digitally verify the identity using 7 possible national IDs&#x2F;documents of consumers or partner businesses. Immediately thereafter, we launched our &#x27;Accounts&#x27; module with 2 partner banks in India, enabling any company to launch fully digital bank accounts (sitting on top of a common physical pool), collect the money via any possible method online into these accounts, fetch bank statements, automate reconciliations, and programmatically route money via any bank transfer channels into any account in the country.<p>Our first customer categories are SMB focused neo-banks and B2B marketplaces in the country that are looking to adopt banking APIs and digitize their money flow and customer lifecycle. Our customers have processed $3M API-based transactions on our platform over the last three months.<p>We just opened the beta APIs of business bank accounts. You can link multiple virtual accounts to your core business account, automate reconciliations, receive payments from your customers, and automate vendor&#x2F;salary payouts instantly. No more payment-processor&#x2F;gateway delays! Our pricing is straightforward and mostly on a per API&#x2F;transaction basis.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts on our proposition. Your unique insights while navigating the complex world of B2B, banking, and payments will help us solve the integrations pain point for good.<p>We are here to answer your questions here or on founders[at]decentro.tech","time":1603793946,"title":"Launch HN: Decentro (YC S20) – APIs for Banking Integrations in India","type":"story"},{"by":"pseudolus","descendants":2,"id":24905974,"kids":[24916933,24918096],"score":54,"time":1603793894,"title":"A Scientist Who Delights in the Mundane","type":"story","url":"https://www.quantamagazine.org/l-mahadevan-finds-math-inspiration-in-the-mundane-20201026/"},{"by":"OpenMPTCProuter","descendants":33,"id":24905937,"kids":[24908470,24912368,24906844,24911097,24908543,24911144,24908821],"score":127,"time":1603793415,"title":"OpenMPTCProuter","type":"story","url":"https://www.openmptcprouter.com"},{"by":"weinzierl","descendants":149,"id":24905920,"kids":[24906211,24906215,24906040,24906173,24908056,24906147,24910595,24907190,24913109,24906015,24906074],"score":221,"time":1603793166,"title":"Twitter preconnects to the wrong domains","type":"story","url":"https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/twitter-preconnects.html"},{"by":"nielsmouthaan","descendants":3,"id":24905912,"kids":[24905922,24906191],"score":6,"time":1603793103,"title":"Show HN: Daily - Accurate time tracking by asking what you are working on","type":"story","url":"https://dailytimetracking.com/"},{"by":"billpg","descendants":8,"id":24905866,"kids":[24906705,24906643,24906630],"score":15,"time":1603792582,"title":"C# designer Torgersen: Why the programming language is still so popular and","type":"story","url":"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/c-designer-torgersen-why-the-programming-language-is-still-so-popular-and-where-its-going-next/"},{"by":"dfgdghdf","descendants":36,"id":24905637,"kids":[24905721,24906114,24906269,24906383,24930078,24906419],"score":31,"time":1603789842,"title":"Coronavirus antibody prevalence falling in England, REACT study shows","type":"story","url":"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/207333/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence-falling-england-react/"},{"by":"joalavedra","descendants":18,"id":24905828,"kids":[24906408,24908344,24907588,24907161,24908192,24909858,24907416,24907189,24911271],"score":67,"time":1603792273,"title":"Show HN: Online Activities for Remote Teams","type":"story","url":"https://onsite.fun/"},{"by":"MikusR","descendants":54,"id":24905634,"kids":[24906946,24906754,24906759,24907079,24906847,24909123,24906726,24907249],"score":118,"time":1603789799,"title":"Graphics in Qt 6.0: QRhi, Qt Quick, Qt Quick 3D","type":"story","url":"https://www.qt.io/blog/graphics-in-qt-6.0-qrhi-qt-quick-qt-quick-3d"},{"by":"polm23","descendants":38,"id":24905780,"kids":[24906039,24906072,24905966,24908177,24906029,24907001,24908113,24907563,24905890,24905998,24905936],"score":101,"time":1603791648,"title":"Spanish police plans to extend use of its lie-detector while efficacy is unclear","type":"story","url":"https://algorithmwatch.org/en/story/spain-police-veripol/"},{"by":"aj_nikhil","descendants":11,"id":24905319,"kids":[24907352,24906672,24906527,24907514],"score":30,"time":1603786053,"title":"Show HN: Apio – Simple Application Monitoring for Node or Django","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/apio-monitor"},{"by":"sunsiren","descendants":2,"id":24905741,"kids":[24913906,24905952],"score":3,"time":1603791198,"title":"Why Are So Many World's Top Brands American?","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6VUd_DoVcY"},{"by":"retrohax","descendants":24,"id":24905247,"kids":[24906139,24908704,24907150,24906295,24907175],"score":93,"time":1603785133,"title":"Amiga 1000 Phoenix Project","type":"story","url":"https://retrohax.net/amiga-1000-project-phoenix-motherborad/"},{"by":"ingve","descendants":2,"id":24905206,"kids":[24910612,24905539],"score":12,"time":1603784644,"title":"U2’s Songs of Innocence Has Haunted Me for 6 Years.

I don&#x27;t know where to start as I&#x27;m not a dev (yet).<p>It will be a couple of forms for customer data, a hosted card capture page (probably stripe or worldpay or something), some blog pages for SEO, some way to spin up lots of landing pages for split tests, some way to aggregate and compare traffic conversion so I can optimise over time.<p>These requirements seem pretty generic: open a bank account, insurance policy, window cleaning subscription, etc. all the same sort of journey and requirements. If I can build a generic journey then I can wrap any product over it. If the business works then I can worry about building a robust, sustainable site later when I&#x27;m making money.<p>Simplest build is probably Wordpress + Elementor? Although I don&#x27;t know PHP and WYSIWYG editors are heavy. At the other end of the scale I could write from scratch an MVC web app and host it on AWS.<p>I don&#x27;t know how to evaluate the options, and I&#x27;m thinking that I must be missing some options, surely there is some Off The Shelf generic drag and drop, cheap web journey builder that will give a decent simple MVP launch? I&#x27;m limited by lack of ability but freed by my lack of ability :) What should I do?<p>2) I need a CRM to manage the applications and navigate the ones I want to work.

That’s crazy simple – it allows you to import xlsx spreadsheet file with data into your system with defined TypeScript types. Basically you need xlsx file which has data in it, and it can have any form you want, use this library and all the data is on its place in your system. Well, best way to understand it is to see samples here:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Siemienik&#x2F;xlsx-import&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;samples<p>Additionally I’ll give you some example here:\nLet’s imagine that you have sales department in your company, and all of your sales teams are working on xlsx files. They even have xlsx file with all their inventory that they are selling. But you have a system which has same inventory in it packed with all the data and lot of formulas. Sales team has to use your system, but they also want to use their xlsx file which has very specific form. All they want to do is to edit their file and import it to your system to create specific entry with this data – e.g. sales campaign with prices and inventory, which can be used by the rest of the company. You can do that very easily with this library. You just need to have to have this xlsx spreadsheet with defined TypeScript types and you are good to go! Sales will be working with their favourite tool and you will have it all in your system :)<p>What do you think about that? Would you use this library?

In fact, it feels kind of liberating not having to think about a bunch of tools; when diving into a new part of the codebase I can just start grepping away. I also feel that not having an IDE forces me to build a detailed mental map of the codebase.<p>For reference, I&#x27;m 23 years old, mostly working in C++, Python, and Haskell, and a touch of JS. I imagine I couldn&#x27;t do this for everything, particularly platforms highly integrated with a specific tool like mobile dev, unity, or fpga.","time":1603650213,"title":"Ask HN: I don't use an IDE, should I be using one?","type":"story"},{"by":"jtokoph","descendants":2,"id":24888365,"kids":[24889992,24889217],"score":16,"time":1603648880,"title":"Secrets of the Nintendo Game Boy Boot Logo","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1cUIGHZLGA"},{"by":"mmastrac","descendants":14,"id":24888307,"kids":[24899409,24903324,24900099],"score":144,"time":1603648430,"title":"UEFI-rs: Write UEFI applications in Rust","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs"},{"by":"atlasunshrugged","descendants":2,"id":24888363,"kids":[24888451,24888501],"score":3,"time":1603648875,"title":"Erik Prince's Private Wars","type":"story","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/erik-prince-libya-blackwater-roger-stone-trump-2020-election-1077089/"},{"by":"URfejk","descendants":217,"id":24888234,"kids":[24893624,24892854,24893100,24892924,24892588,24892499,24892564,24892608,24896226,24893303,24892172,24893997,24892963,24893547,24893957,24892734,24894229,24893497,24896022,24894968,24892420,24892482],"score":530,"time":1603648002,"title":"The RIAA’s attack on YouTube-dl is not a DMCA 512 infringement","type":"story","url":"https://joindiaspora.com/posts/808cf690f8e801381778002590d8e506"},{"by":"aidenyb","descendants":30,"id":24887968,"kids":[24888638,24888620,24892065,24888529,24888733,24888585,24890157,24890243,24889694,25013909,25013911,24893803],"score":84,"time":1603646554,"title":"Show HN: Lucia – 3kB Vue Alternative","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/aidenybai/lucia"},{"by":"TeaVMFan","descendants":3,"id":24887922,"kids":[24910018,24888025,24887945],"score":3,"time":1603646262,"title":"Java: Winning Many Battles, Now to Win the War","type":"story","url":"https://frequal.com/java/JavaWinningBattlesNowForTheWar.html"},{"by":"jhncls","descendants":10,"id":24887925,"kids":[24889753,24889567,24889553,24889860,24889828,24889386],"score":50,"time":1603646268,"title":"Neuropilin-1 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and infectivity","type":"story","url":"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/10/19/science.abd2985"},{"by":"grzm","descendants":65,"id":24887676,"kids":[24904644,24905167,24905022,24906387,24906086],"score":142,"time":1603644752,"title":"Improving Postgres Connection Scalability: Snapshots","type":"story","url":"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-database-for-postgresql/improving-postgres-connection-scalability-snapshots/ba-p/1806462"},{"by":"asim","descendants":300,"id":24887521,"kids":[24889100,24887777,24887839,24887910,24887759,24887820,24888287,24887796,24888159,24888513,24888170,24888149,24888514,24888406,24887987,24887668,24887889,24888018,24887720,24887893,24894411,24890683,24890147,24888031,24887706,24888061,24888087,24888283,24889571,24888233,24889272,24887926,24887800,24889270,24887787,24897199,24887898,24889867,24887743,24893384,24888555,24889474,24889246,24887966,25008993,24887663,24889638,24889148,24888039,24891915,24889173,24889416,24887661,24888960,24888216,24889453,24895208,24888877,24889199,24894089,24892454,24888624,24888141,24891845,24889233,24887650,24887665,24903929,24887674,24888094,24889619,24896000,24887780,24889687,24888789,24889358,24890792,24891594,24888576,24889544,24887944,24887624,24890939,24888236,24913626,24887969,24887917],"score":192,"text":"What are your thoughts on the Go programming language?","time":1603643726,"title":"Ask HN: Go programming language is over ten years old.

and Sajan here, co-founders of Laylo (cal.laylo.com), a platform for content creators to offer one-click reminders to their upcoming content, events and merchandise.<p>To give some backstory, over the last year we were building a data startup to help musicians understand who their biggest fans are online. We partnered with Sony Music and have over 600,000 artists accessing their fan data through our API. One thing we constantly noticed was that artists were posting on Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, etc. about their upcoming releases. The problem was that since their releases weren’t out yet, they didn’t have any destination to send fans.<p>Posts like “new merch dropping next Tuesday at 3 PST” assumes that fans will actually remember. It also uses up valuable social media real estate and doesn’t give the artist any usable data.<p>That’s why we built Laylo Drops. Drops lets you create a landing page for your upcoming releases, captures your fan data (emails and phone numbers), and automatically reminds them at the time of the drop.<p>Drops links are sharable anywhere that you can put a link: IG Stories, Twitter, etc. Fans don’t even need to create an account to RSVP. We also provide social media templates, custom messaging tools and more to make the marketing simple.<p>We set our sights on the music industry (because that’s where we started) but ultimately our goal is to help creators of all kinds connect directly with their audience and make announcements with ease.<p>We would love to hear your feedback and your experiences as creators or working with creators. We’re very excited to be sharing this with HN, and we’ll be here to answer any and all questions you want to throw our way!<p>Thanks,<p>Alec","time":1603638229,"title":"Launch HN: Laylo (YC S20) – Fan reminders for content, merchandise, and events","type":"story"},{"by":"0xmohit","descendants":0,"id":24886716,"kids":[24886752,24888438],"score":1,"time":1603637648,"title":"While the Poor Get Sick, Bill Gates Just Gets Richer","type":"story","url":"https://www.thenation.com/article/economy/bill-gates-investments-covid/"},{"by":"teptoria","descendants":2,"id":24886609,"kids":[24886945,24886785],"score":5,"text":"5 years ago, the answer to doing a great CRUD app would be Django + SQL Relational DB. \nNow we live in the ever-changing age of serverless, with countless DB structures, web frameworks and system architectures.<p>In your experience (or if you have benchmarks or anecdotes feel free to share), what&#x27;s the best way to structure + architect a CRUD webapp?

Python fits this bill. Python&#x27;s standard library has functions like math.comb(), math.gcd(), math.factorial(), etc. They make it easy to write down many closed-form expressions without reinventing the wheel.<p>* Speed. If I am exploring a new concept and I want to test a conjecture for large numbers, such iterate-and-test loops in Python run 30 times slower than equivalent loops in C++. Here C&#x2F;C++ fits the bill and Python does not.<p>* Expressibility. While I am exploring mathematics, it should not feel like I am fighting the syntax of the language. Python and Java fit the bill due to their simplicity. C++ is manageable. Rust feels like too much work for quick and dirty hacks to test conjectures.<p>* Longevity. The language should be stable and not prone to too many breaking changes. Some code I write now should run without modifications ten years later. C, C++, Go fit the bill. Python does not.<p>* Open source implementations. The language must have popular free and open source implementations. I don&#x27;t want to be paying large sums of money for something like MATLAB or Mathematica. Most languages popular here on Hacker News like Python, Go, Rust, etc. fit the bill.<p>Now if there is no language that do not meet all the requirements above, that is fine.

Likewise, everyone should have a fundamental understanding of the equity markets, derivatives markets, futures markets, bond and treasury markets along with an understanding of how interest rates work and their effects on financial instruments like mortgages.

All this can be taught without giving financial advice, which may be more in the domain of parents, but by focusing on the theoretical and historical aspects of financial instruments so that kids have a better understanding of how they work and are better prepared for life in general.","time":1603521547,"title":"Ask HN: Why isn’t finance a part of the core curriculum at schools?","type":"story"},{"by":"harley1611","descendants":5,"id":24877383,"kids":[24877648,24881121,24877411,24879251],"score":6,"text":"Hi.

And will we ever be?<p>The following are my thoughts on why were rejected, and a few concerns which still slumber in the back of my mind: \nI believe that 3 main issues caused our application to be firmly placed in the rejected pile. I do not believe that it was a close call.<p>The number 1 reason: Team. \nOriginally, I had the idea for my startup 5 years ago, and since then I have moved continent, started a family, gotten jobs, left jobs, and struggled to launch my startup. I guess, one of the side-effects of moving country is your network goes from level 80, to level 0. I tried some cofounder dating, and actually found a great CTO to join me, but after 2 months of working together, he was asked to become the new Vice Minister of Technology for the country, and therefore had to quit the startup. Thereafter, I &quot;convinced&quot; a technical and strategic partner to join my company, even though we lived 7 timezones apart, we believed that we could manage (spoiler alert, we couldn&#x27;t). The project was not moving ahead at the pace we wanted it. And finally, my new CTO quit, after being offered a senior position at AWS. Alone again... I am now working with a former co-worker, and friend, but he has been clear from the beginning, that is not interested in the CTO position. He wishes to continue his employment for the coming 5 years or so. In the same period, I found a CMO to join the team, but that didn&#x27;t work out either, as I felt he was not invested in the project.","time":1603335413,"title":"Why did I get rejected?","type":"story"},{"by":"raiyu","descendants":2,"id":24854470,"kids":[24854599,24854514],"score":3,"time":1603335357,"title":"Descript","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl9wqNe5J8U"},{"by":"geerlingguy","descendants":6,"id":24854462,"kids":[24854475,24859000],"score":22,"time":1603335254,"title":"Trying to Get an Nvidia GPU to Work with Raspberry Pi CM4","type":"story","url":"https://gist.github.com/geerlingguy/9f1510ab028e68b712381520308db2af"},{"by":"barry-cotter","descendants":81,"id":24854357,"kids":[24854723,24856123,24854442,24855472,24855937,24856006,24854731,24856107,24854705,24855085,24855004,24855364,24854949,24854974],"score":92,"time":1603333899,"title":"We Were Builders Once, and Strong","type":"story","url":"https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2020/10/we-were-builders-once-and-strong.html"},{"by":"cwwc","descendants":96,"id":24854222,"kids":[24854753,24854842,24855600,24854704,24854784,24856852,24854922,24855544,24854697,24854789,24854843,24854976],"score":89,"time":1603332177,"title":"Call to arms: Sweden raises defense spending by 40% in 5 years","type":"story","url":"https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/10/19/sweden-embarks-on-its-largest-military-build-up-for-decades"},{"by":"prostoalex","descendants":104,"id":24854207,"kids":[24864843,24864674,24864874,24864997,24864766,24869826,24864260,24865323,24864757,24865156,24864787,24864153,24864068],"score":128,"time":1603331978,"title":"Chefs are adapting their menus for chilly outdoor dining","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-21/how-chefs-are-adapting-their-menus-for-chilly-outdoor-dining"},{"by":"sohkamyung","descendants":93,"id":24854201,"kids":[24855257,24854988,24856780,24854849,24857157,24855432,24857308,24860482,24856587],"score":125,"time":1603331894,"title":"The Physics of Space War: How Orbital Dynamics Constrain Engagements [pdf]","type":"story","url":"https://aerospace.org/sites/default/files/2020-10/Reesman_PhysicsWarSpace_20201001.pdf"},{"by":"MonkeyIsNull","dead":true,"id":24854099,"kids":[24854658,24854739],"score":13,"time":1603330556,"title":"The Media Manipulation Casebook","type":"story","url":"https://mediamanipulation.org/"},{"by":"elijahparker","descendants":2,"id":24854169,"kids":[24854758,24854221],"score":24,"time":1603331427,"title":"Simple Software Creates Complex Wooden Joints That Interlock with No Nails, Glue","type":"story","url":"https://scitechdaily.com/simple-software-creates-complex-wooden-joints-that-interlock-with-no-nails-glue-or-tools-needed/"},{"by":"windows2020","descendants":3,"id":24854078,"kids":[24854079,24854215],"score":1,"time":1603330261,"title":"Some Thoughts on Windows 10","type":"story","url":"https://imgur.com/a/JVkj1dZ"},{"by":"crazypython","descendants":2,"id":24854055,"kids":[24855259,24854094],"score":6,"text":"One of my acquaintances is doing a research project on autism.

I know what his life has been like.<p>But we do not -- even though we share the same parents, and toilet. From birth, men and women are installed with different software. We are given different information. Our worldviews have totally different frameworks.<p>If you compare the pile of books and magazines by our beds, you see how this happens. When Andrew was thirteen, the floor by his bed was heaped with gaming magazines, and books about physics. He liked physics, his Xbox, and he read books and magazines solely about how to be good at physics -- and about how to play Xbox.<p>He had no choice in this -- there are no &quot;general interest&quot; magazines for teenage boys. A boy in a newsagent is faced with specialist titles -- on music, gaming, fishing, film, martial arts, etc. -- and so gains a worldview dictated by mono-interest, clannish communities, dedicated to becoming good at &quot;a thing.&quot; In newsagents, this is made clear by simple categorization: &quot;men&#x27;s magazines&quot; are racked together under the title &quot;Men&#x27;s Interests.&quot; Men have interests. You pick your thing; you dedicate yourself to it. You see the whole world through your specialist subject. You concentrate on becoming good at your thing -- and that is how you become successful. This is the way of men.<p>By way of contrast, the newsagent&#x27;s racks for female periodicals are titled &quot;Women&#x27;s Lifestyle.&quot; Men have interests -- women have lives. Lives they must strive to perfect. As a consequence, the magazines heaped by my bed were there to guide me through a world where it was presumed I would have to become knowledgeable about a whole range of things that would give me not an interest, but a life. And a stylish life, at that. And that is how you beocme successful if you are a woman.&quot;","time":1603291329,"title":"Why Women Don't

Not being a security-aware techie, she checked off every single item in the &quot;you should not do that&quot; list.  From passwords that can be hacked in 2 minutes flat to using the same password (or single character variants) on dozens of sites.  And, of course, passwords stored in Chrome, Safari and others in her head.  Frankly, I was surprised she finally agreed to migrate to a password manager.<p>Yet, that&#x27;s not what this post is about.  We had to change the password, secret questions and sometimes user ID on dozens of sites.  Through this journey of somewhere in the order of a dozen hours I got to see the good, the bad and the ugly --really ugly-- of nonsensical passwords policies and laughable-if-it-wasn&#x27;t-serious approaches to user login, UI, uid and pwd recovery, password policies, confusing login sequences, logins requiring visits to multiple websites to login to a service, ridiculous login URL&#x27;s, sites with parking pages for the main site and a full site only on a subdomain and more.  Frankly, I was horrified.<p>I wish I had kept detailed notes, I did not.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting this and we were just trying to get done.  I am typing this from memory.<p>The first &quot;what are they thinking?&quot; that came to mind is Trello.  Yup.  If you got to trello.com&#x2F;login to login it presents you with a normal-looking user and password form.  As soon as you enter your email the password field goes away and you are presented with one option:  A &quot;Login with Atlassian&quot; button.<p>Imagine my wife&#x27;s surprise.  She has no clue who Atlassian is or how it might be related to Trello.  Why do I have to have an account with Atlassian?<p>To make matters worse, the Trello login URL and the URL that you are routed to once you click the &quot;Login with Atlassian&quot; button (to then enter the password) are different, of course.  Which means that your password manager is now confused because you entered your user ID at trello.com and now your password has to be entered at atlassian.com.<p>Really, seriously, what rocket scientist thought this would be a good idea?<p>And then you have banks and credit card companies with the weirdest password policies.  Anything from 8 to 12 characters and almost randomly chosen ideas on upper case, lower case and symbol content.<p>One memorable one had useful guidance under password creation field.  One line per policy and a checkbox that would turn green and be checked if you met that requirements.  So, you start typing a password and different checkmarks light-up.<p>One of the requirements was &quot;A symbol from this set:&quot; followed by a bunch of symbols.<p>Well, guess what, &quot;A symbol&quot; quite literally meant ONE and only one character.  Which means that the randomly generated password from the password manager --which contained a good assortment of upper, lower and symbols-- never passed the test.  Until I realized that &quot;a symbol&quot; actually meant only one, rather than many.  Problem solved...time wasted.<p>Oh, and speaking of typing...<p>Yet another website, I think it was a credit card, refused to allow us to login after changing the password.  We must have done the password recovering thing three times.  We&#x27;d generate a fresh 32 character random password, click-paste on both fields, click &quot;Save&quot; and go.  The site accepted the password happily and said &quot;You succeeded in changing your password&quot;.<p>Every single time we tried to login it said we had a bad password.  Unbelievable.<p>Well, turns out to be that they had a policy limiting password length to 16 characters.  In order to see this you had to click on a link labeled something like &quot;password tips&quot;.  We did not.<p>What these geniuses did was to TRUNCATE (yes, I am telling) the 32 character password from the password manager and store that.  Since the truncated version matched in both recovery fields, they said &quot;success!&quot;.   They said nothing about having truncated it.  So, when you try to login with the full 32 character pwd...it doesn&#x27;t work.  This was just maddening.<p>I came across another site with similar truncation, this one truncated to 12 characters.  As if written by close cousins, this one did not warn the user about the truncation.  The only hint was that the 32 dots became 12 every time I pasted the password.  At least that was a hint!<p>And yet, one of my favorites belongs to our water company:<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;valenciawater.com&#x2F;<p>No, no, that&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s a domain parking page.  Yup.<p>I went there when my wife told me she was paying the bills at this URL:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webpay.valenciawater.com&#x2F;iwr&#x2F;user&#x2F;login.seam<p>I setup the password manager to go to the root domain, after all, that payment URL could be changed, right?<p>Well, that&#x27;s when I ran into the parked-domain-as-a-feature site (or whatever you want to call it).  I could not believe this could belong to a legitimate water company.  My first thought was that my wife has been paying money to some scam artist for months and could not understand why our water had not been shutoff.<p>So I did what anyone would do, I googled our water company and found they have a legitimate looking website:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yourscvwater.com&#x2F;<p>OK, that makes sense.  I thought, OK, I&#x27;ll find the proper login URL and setup the password manager accordingly.   Sure enough, they service three regions, two of them are services through the URL my wife had been using:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webpay.valenciawater.com&#x2F;iwr&#x2F;user&#x2F;login.seam<p>And the other through this other URL:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ipn.paymentus.com&#x2F;rotp&#x2F;scwd<p>Unbelievable.<p>Today&#x27;s journey was a jaw-dropping trip through a valley of incompetence and an exhibition of a complete lack of common sense in web development.  I don&#x27;t know what to say other than to ask:  Where do these clowns come from?  These are not insignificant companies.  And, in most cases, they handle money and important personal information for their clients.  This is horrific.

I have experience with the JVM and the Node.js platforms and what&#x27;s necessary to keep them operational: containerization, cloud computing, databases, etc.<p>I think I&#x27;ve reached an upper bound as a grunt programmer. I tried management as a new direction but it didn&#x27;t work out, I just can&#x27;t do it, it makes my life miserable. I noticed however, that I have a unique ability: I really like talking to people (including business folks), wrapping my head around their problems and figuring out robust solutions for them including all the models, documentation and preliminary implementations (POC&#x2F;MVP). I&#x27;m also good at sharing the knowledge (right now I&#x27;m working as a tech trainer).<p>I did this a few times as part of some contract work and everybody was very happy with it but I don&#x27;t know how to scale this into a consulting business. What I want to keep doing is getting projects from 0 to POC&#x2F;MVP state. I can help putting together teams, figuring out the architecture, and concrete solutions &#x2F; algorithms, but if I keep doing the grunt work instead, it won&#x27;t pay that well. So to sum it all up I can apply my skills in an area that has higher returns, but I don&#x27;t really know how to get there.<p>What should I do to achieve this? What makes this harder is that I&#x27;m not living in the USA (I live in Hungary, Europe).<p>Edit: I quit my day job half a year ago. I was thinking about a sabbatical, but people from my network started to appear and now I&#x27;m swamped with work. What my goal is to streamline all this and turn regular grunt programming into a specialized format where the ROI is much better.<p>I also have a business partner who has similar ideas but a different skill set, and I&#x27;m trying to shape this into something that&#x27;s more effective.<p>I already have a blog, a GitHub portfolio, and I&#x27;m regularly talking on meetups, but you are right, I

it&#x27;s Yury and Steve from Openland (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openland.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openland.com</a>). We make it easy for any person or business to build a chat community.<p>We believe that in the next five years there will be a massive shift from audiences (top-down content broadcasting) to communities (two-way communication between organizers and members and among members). For members, communities fulfill fundamental social needs: new friendships, safe space for self-expression, learning from peers. For organizers, communities help collect leads, sell, drive customer success, or earn direct revenue from members.<p>Today, building a great community is super hard. Getting people in one place, explaining and enforcing the rules, collecting member info, and interacting in a scalable personalized way takes a huge amount of time.<p>That&#x27;s why we&#x27;ve built Openland. At its center, there&#x27;s a new fully-functional messenger, comparable to FB Messenger or WhatsApp. On top of that, we added tools for onboarding, automated messaging, integrations (CRMs, etc.), analytics, and paid memberships. Community automation is what sets Openland apart from other messengers and community platforms.<p>Openland has actually started as a marketplace for urban land. While working on its messaging module, we realized that professional messaging in general is much underdeveloped and our talents are better suited for building a horizontal messenger than a vertical marketplace. We made a pivot shortly after YC graduation and spent the next two years quietly building a new messenger for communities.<p>Since our soft-launch this Summer, 250+ communities launched on Openland around educational programs, professional services, tech products, content creators, and nonprofits. There are also standalone communities built from scratch. The largest community has 14k+ members who&#x27;ve already sent 500k+ messages. Openland is free to use. Today, we take a small revenue cut from member-supported communities and will add premium plans for business-led communities later in the future.<p>If you want to start a community for your customers, students, fans, or followers, we&#x27;d be delighted to help. To coordinate, ping Yury at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openland.com&#x2F;yury\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openland.com&#x2F;yury</a> or email at yury@openland.com.<p>Openland is built on FoundationDB, Node.js, and React Native. For anyone interested in messaging tech, we share our engineering lessons at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openland.com&#x2F;tech\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openland.com&#x2F;tech</a>.<p>We’d love to hear your thoughts and questions.

However I don’t think there are APIs provided by these services that let you sync to your own backend. Dropbox deprecated their sync API a few years ago, presumably because it gave away their core functionality.<p>Some options that I see so far:\n- Use Dropbox API webhooks to be notified of file changes, then do the syncing logic myself (using s3 for persistence and postgres for file metadata)\n- Write my own custom sync logic for all platforms that I want to support\n- Try to shoe horn an open source sync lib onto the platforms I want to support. Eg Syncthing is written in Go which could theoretically get running in iOS<p>For option 1 my concern is that I still have to write plenty of sync logic server side, why not go the extra step and implement the client(s). I am also beholden your the API in a few ways: 1) They could end their service, 2) All my users have to have an account with them, 3) My cache of files is a bit of a 3rd class citizen as it will be last to get change notifications.<p>My concern with option two (write it myself) is simply that it’s a lot of work. Although it would be fun work to do, it’s still a distraction from everything else core to my service.<p>Option 3 seems doable but potentially a misadventure of working against the grain of the

I suspect this trend has been fuelled by a concerted effort by skilled state actors to divide people in the US, and the west in general. These groups have been given near free rein by Facebook, YouTube et al. to run highly sophisticated campaigns to maximize chaos and destroy civil discourse. I understand that Facebook et al. are trying to prevent this, but as someone who has a PhD in Deep Learning, I am high skeptical of the ability of ML&#x2F;DL&#x2F;AI&#x2F;Whatever to combat such actors. I feel like we are at a stage where someone&#x27;s idea of truth has been so tightly strangled by their social media intake that if you were to send a flat-earther to space on a rocket, they would declare the experience as fake and fabricated. Today, watching the supreme court judge nominee say that climate change was debatable, when in fact it, man made or not, it is an irrefutable fact, really made me feel pessimistic about this whole situation. If we continue on this path, and I struggle to see a way out, it seems almost inevitable that we are heading into a situation where the damage done will be too great to remedy.<p>People watch over 114 THOUSAND YEARS of youtube per a day, some of that might be educational, but the majority of that is thanks to the algorithm playing with their limbic system, sending them down yet another rabbit hole, and people in general are complete slaves to their limbic system.

We are Lucia and Jimmy, co-founders at Osmind (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osmind.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osmind.org&#x2F;</a>). We build software that helps mental health doctors treat their patients in evidence-based, data-driven ways. Along the way, we develop better methods of diagnosing and treating people in a personalized manner.<p>Jimmy and I met at Stanford in a healthcare IT class at Stanford last year where I wrapped up my MBA and Jimmy is on leave from medical school. We’ve dedicated our personal and professional efforts to healthcare - I led operations and business at AI-driven neuroscience biotech Verge Genomics (S15) and Jimmy founded multiple healthcare nonprofits across digital health, care delivery, and research. Like many, we’ve seen too many of our loved ones fail to find the right mental health treatment for them. We realized we want to build something to help -- and we’re optimistic that neuroscience and psychiatry are on the verge of a revolution. We’ve built Osmind to maximize access to innovative mental health treatments for those who need it the most.<p>Over 20M Americans who suffer from treatment-resistant mental health conditions, which means they’ve tried and failed two or more conventional treatments. Oftentimes, finding the right mental health treatment means years of trial &amp; error and suffering. On top of that, patients with treatment-resistant mental health conditions annually cost $900B+ in direct medical spend, twice as much as people with less severe versions of the same conditions. Researchers and doctors just haven’t been able to find mental health therapies that work well (conventional antidepressants have an estimated ~30% effectiveness rate). This is because pharma lacks sufficient understanding of mental health pathophysiology while clinicians lack the right data on what treatments work best for which people.<p>We approach this problem in two ways: 1) we build software for doctors and 2) generate insights for better development of therapies, treatment algorithms, and diagnostics.<p>First, we sell an electronic health record (EHR) to doctors working with treatment-resistant mental health patients. Our EHR enables doctors to measure how patients are doing in between appointments via an integrated patient mobile app to drive personalized, improved clinical decision-making. For example, we can use data science to automatically detect symptom exacerbation or improvement (from patient-reported outcomes or functional metrics such as activity levels) and get them in for treatments at the right time. This is a rarity for EHRs, especially in treatment-resistant mental health, which is known to lack evidence-based practices and consists of a difficult-to-treat patient population. Our EHR also automates administrative tasks such as collecting intake forms and getting reimbursement from insurance companies. Our ultimate goal is to make recommendations to the doctor on what treatments work best for people based on objective criteria such as their past medical history, demographics, and more. That way, doctors can deliver the best possible care, and patients can get better. We launched the software in June and are serving over 125 clinics nationwide covering over 20,000 patients receiving FDA-approved psychedelic medicine, neuromodulation, and general psychiatry treatment.<p>Second, we can extract insights from the software to find better and more precise ways of treating individuals. Our software above aggregates clinical, patient-reported, digital, and biological information, which has never been done at scale in mental health. For example, establishing more objective predictors of depression and correlating them with treatment impact can help us diagnose people more precisely and determine what makes one type of treatment better than the other. We can use this information to better design clinical trials that actually succeed, potentially saving billions of dollars of sunk costs to develop therapies that work. New innovation in mental health is on the horizon with the development of efficacious treatments like ketamine, FDA-approved psychedelic medicines, neuromodulation, digital therapeutics, and more. Long term, the holy grail would be to obtain a biological understanding of mental health and find diagnostics and therapies that can end suffering brought on by mental health issues.<p>We care deeply about patient and clinician privacy as well. Our platform is HIPAA-compliant and protected by end-to-end encryption. We work with independent third parties to verify our compliance and security. Patients own their health data and have the right to all of it. Any analysis we do is always on anonymized and aggregated information and never traceable back to an individual or clinic. We openly state that our mission to advance new treatments to the patients and doctors we work with and have found that the whole field is motivated to help - everyone realizes it’s an all-hands-on-deck movement.<p>Please drop us a line if you’re at all interested in learning more or have any feedback. We’re also hiring software engineers and would be grateful to be in touch with anyone in this community!

One of the things it can do is start an action that might take a few <i>days</i> to complete (e.g. ask someone for an approval). The flow is in a running state for days without anything happening, and it carries on where it left off once the action completes.<p>It got me wondering if there is any way to do that in actual code. I would want to write something like<p><pre><code>  doSomething();\n  const result = await offline someVeryVeryLongRunningThing();\n  doSomethingElse();\n</code></pre>\nThen behind the scenes someVeryVeryLongRunningThing launches its own process for doing its thing, using polling, events, whatever it wants. (It&#x27;s a specially written function that supports async offline.) The main process saves its state to disk somewhere and <i>terminates</i>. Then when someVeryVeryLongRunningThing finishes (or fails), the original process is relaunched with the state and call stack that were there before, and carries on where it left off.<p>Obviously things like open sockets and file handles will be lost. But if it could at least retrieve those parts of state that are just data that would still leave a lot of useful use cases. And this is something a compiler could catch.<p>Now of course you can implement it yourself in all sorts of ways, but there would be a lot of boilerplate and the code would not look anything like the above.

You can also try it out: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gazepass.com&#x2F;<p>Passwords add friction during registration and login. Our mission at Gaze is to eliminate them from the Internet. We do this by enabling brilliant hackers such as yourself to remove passwords from your products.<p>Meet Gazepass—a fully passwordless login API that lets your users sign up with just a few clicks, and subsequently login seamlessly.<p>Here are the highlights:<p>- Social Accounts: Users can register with Google or by typing in their email address (more social logins to come in the future)<p>- Native Biometrics: They can subsequently login using native biometric auth (like Apple Face ID, Windows Hello or Android&#x27;s biometric-enabled devices)<p>- Camera Face ID: If they don&#x27;t have a biometric sensor on their device, they can choose to sign in with camera face ID—our own face ID technology that runs on any webcam&#x2F;front facing camera<p>- User Choice: If your users prefer not to use biometrics at all, they can disable biometrics altogether and login with a single click<p>Integrating Gazepass on your website is easy too! We have already released our JS SDK for integration on websites. We will be releasing our mobile SDKs very soon as well (currently under development). You will also find relevant API endpoints on our docs (which are constantly being improved -- launching comprehensive docs very soon).<p>This is just the very first version of our product—there&#x27;s lots more in store. We would love to hear from you and get your thoughts&#x2F;feedback. You can join our Slack workspace by visiting https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gaze.ai&#x2F;slack -- we&#x27;ll be waiting to start working with you!

It&#x27;s a combination of a decentralised identity system and a decentralised messaging system that makes use of the aforementioned new identity system.<p>It&#x27;s based on cryptographic keys with one major property: keys are paired with arbitrary mnemonic strings, e.g. your favourite username, so apps can send messages in a P2P fashion addressed to the strings directly without having to worry about IP addresses. These key-string pairs can be generated on-the-fly on any computer and there&#x27;s no central database. When multiple people inevitably choose the same strings as their identifiers, e.g. 5 people choose &#x27;alice&#x27;, the system has a consensus mechanism for resolving such conflicts across the entire network so &#x27;alice&#x27; will always point to one public key that all nodes will use at a given point in time for encryption and signature verification. This means that only that specific &#x27;alice&#x27; will receive any messages sent to that identifier. The other 4 people won&#x27;t be able to read them.<p>I&#x27;ve written two papers describing both systems:<p>* Nomicle: A decentralised, identity-based, cryptography system [ http:&#x2F;&#x2F;noraco.org&#x2F;projects&#x2F;xp002&#x2F;docs&#x2F;XP002.pdf ]<p>* xTalk: A Nomicle-powered, inter-app messaging system [ http:&#x2F;&#x2F;noraco.org&#x2F;projects&#x2F;hp001&#x2F;docs&#x2F;HP001.pdf ]<p>I plan on releasing the source code and documentation some time later this month. It&#x27;s all written in Python. Nomicle&#x27;s code includes a Python library as well as a C library that developers can use to integrate it into their apps. I&#x27;m trying to make it as easy and simple as possible for anyone to pick up. These are the first projects in a pipeline of open source projects that build on this work and that I intend to work on and release in the near future. Messaging is one potential use of Nomicle, but I can already see more uses such as consensus-based packet routing and information publishing. In fact, the latter is the next project I&#x27;ll be working on.","time":1602341967,"title":"Show HN: Decentralised Digital Identity and Messaging","type":"story"},{"by":"sss111","descendants":6,"id":24739423,"kids":[24740507,24743797,24740547,24743719,24741126,24740189],"score":40,"time":1602342037,"title":"Easily build webapps for ML and DS projects","type":"story","url":"https://www.streamlit.io/"},{"by":"dr_dshiv","descendants":8,"id":24739220,"kids":[24813954,24739240,24741773,24739351,24739286,24739425,24739552],"score":2,"text":"I get distracted by my own writing and want to write without the desire to edit.

want to understand how architecture is practiced at FAANG companies (or similar companies, like Uber, AirBnB, Dropbox etc.) To make that question more concrete, I&#x27;m interested in understanding the following:<p>- By what roles is architecture done at your company? Is it a separate architect role, or part of engineering roles?<p>- How are architecture decisions made and validated?<p>- How is architecture documented?<p>- How much freedom is there in making architecture decisions as a (product) team?<p>- Related to the previous question, are there top-down &quot;rules&quot; in terms of technology choices? For example: what databases you can use, what API protocols are mandated (e.g. REST vs GraphQL vs gRPC). If there are general rules, who makes those rules and who updates those rules?<p>- Does your company explicitly deal with &quot;Business Architecture&quot; next to technology architecture? If so, how and why? (ie. what problems does it solve for you?)<p>- What downsides do you perceive to the way architecture is practiced at your company?<p>Some background: I&#x27;m working at a big enterprise&#x2F;corporate in Europe that wasn&#x27;t originally a digital business. Like most companies, we&#x27;ve been focusing on making more parts of our operations digital and basically becoming a digital-first company. Now I&#x27;m interested to have a look outside my own bubble and to see how companies that are technology-focused at heart and digital-first are approaching architecture.<p>I&#x27;m not looking to start a flamewar on the merits of architecture roles or anything. I just want to understand how others are doing it, so I can learn.<p>Thanks in advance for your answers!","time":1602326231,"title":"Ask HN: How is architecture practiced at FAANG companies?","type":"story"},{"by":"swazzy","descendants":292,"id":24737993,"kids":[24739180,24738726,24739253,24738479,24738230,24738601,24738813,24738128,24740538,24739771,24738682,24738313,24738289,24743752,24738716,24742837,24739757,24740305,24739495,24743617,24738660,24738714,24740637,24741143,24738224,24738195,24738549,24741036,24742925,24738866,24742825,24740020,24740032,24739984,24743910,24738780,24740632,24740945,24743500,24738212,24738263,24739614,24739788,24738498],"score":702,"time":1602326111,"title":"They're Made Out of Meat (1991)","type":"story","url":"https://www.mit.edu/people/dpolicar/writing/prose/text/thinkingMeat.html"},{"by":"alexis2b","descendants":2,"id":24737982,"kids":[24738283,24737998],"score":4,"time":1602325997,"title":"Odin: «Cloud-based» replacement for troubled F-35s software","type":"story","url":"https://www.flightglobal.com/military-uavs/first-lockheed-martin-f-35s-loaded-with-odin-hardware/140551.article"},{"by":"todsacerdoti","descendants":83,"id":24737934,"kids":[24738432,24738208,24740520,24739031,24738253,24741104],"score":124,"time":1602325463,"title":"Arch Conf 2020 Streaming [video]","type":"story","url":"https://streaming.media.ccc.de/archconf2020/ArchConf"},{"by":"bookofjoe","descendants":23,"id":24737911,"kids":[24751630,24749803,24750323,24749549,24754321],"score":49,"time":1602325293,"title":"What happened to South America's missing mega-mammals?","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/science/mammals-south-america-extinction.html"},{"by":"susam","descendants":2,"id":24737843,"kids":[24749677,24750581],"score":2,"time":1602324174,"title":"Show HN: TeXMe Demo","type":"story","url":"https://spdocs.github.io/texme/examples/demo.html"},{"by":"ColinWright","descendants":130,"id":24737789,"kids":[24738438,24738007,24738086,24738136,24739117,24739857,24743503,24737961,24739076,24738849,24739577,24741265,24738422,24739108,24737936,24737913,24738036,24738114,24738235],"score":94,"time":1602323277,"title":"Is your programming language unreasonable?

Like a lot of people today, I&#x27;ve been on the job search most of this year due to not having a job. But this current trend for me started a few years ago, well before Covid hit.<p>My career started by working contract after contract for a few years, then jobs dried up around 5 years ago. No longer able to support myself I moved in back with one of my parents. Meanwhile I continued to search for jobs including full-time ones. Considering all this, though, I think I am stuck in a job search &quot;trance&quot;. Even though I barely have enough money for myself, with only small contract gigs (and ineligible for unemployment insurance) I am living comfortably with my family. I have no obligation to pay rent because the place is so cheap. My parents only care that I run errands for them. Job searching doesn&#x27;t get brought up often unless I mention something about it.<p>My parents don&#x27;t come from a lot of money- far from it. I grew up in a low-income household and paid my way through college with loans and Pell grands. My parents just managed to do a good job saving enough for retirement after their steady careers. So that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m dealing with.<p>As for me, I continue working on different projects to keep my work skills relevant. I participate in networking events and get mock interviews. But seems like I&#x27;m not pushing myself hard enough. The comfort of a free roof over my head is working against me without me realizing it for so long.<p>Being supported by my parents and my lukewarm opportunities appear to go hand in hand. So how do I boost this motivation when I have this warm, comfortable safety net?

here - I am one of the creators of Doppler and I’m pumped (and kinda nervous!) to share it with HN.<p>Doppler is an easy way to manage and share environment variables and secrets -- things like API keys, database credentials, feature flags, and configuration like a port or a hostname. We’ve heard it&#x27;s “GitHub for secrets”.<p>While working at Uber and small startups, managing app config via env vars really sucked. Simple options like .env files were a nightmare to keep updated. Enterprise tools like HashiCorp Vault and AWS Parameter Store felt like we were stuck using FTP instead of Dropbox!<p>For the past 2 years, we’ve been heads-down building a secrets manager we actually want to use. For our customers, it&#x27;s now their central source of truth for secrets and app configuration. They use Doppler to quickly organize and sync secrets with teammates and across infra, from local to prod on every stack. It has the features you&#x27;d want in a secrets manager, like sharing, audit logs, versioning, and integrations with major cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Heroku, Docker, Netlify, Laravel Forge, etc.).<p>We’re deeply committed to strong security controls and highly available infra. Best-practices like data tokenization, security driven design, and external pentests help keep us secure: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doppler.com&#x2F;security\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doppler.com&#x2F;security</a>. And fully managed encrypted fallbacks in your infra means your secrets are always available, even in the rare case we aren’t.<p>To support our community, we’re committed to offering a community plan that&#x27;s free forever for unlimited users.

The number of systems goes through the roof. The overall management of these systems became very poor.<p>Passwords are found in source repositories, servers and processes appear to be not monitored in production, the feature selection became a democratic vote between business people, writing tests is skipped way too often, code is not cleaned up before committing, merge requests are incomplete and what not. The data science team even refuses to even talk about their practices. They just SSH&#x2F;RDP into their servers, install dozens random products, hack away some Python or R or whatnot, take a database dump here and there. No GIT, no docs, no tickets, no nothing.<p>In short: Many new hires in a short time frame brought a huge lack in good practice and craftsmanship into the company.<p>Should the &quot;Head of IT&quot; of roughly 50 people even bother with the all the many little details of the work produced?

the correct way to ask this question.<p>I recently found out that I am not eligible to apply for the Computer Science masters program in my country at my previous University. (GPA is too low) While disappointing, it is understandable, way too much happened at my uni stay that honestly glad I was just able to graduate.<p>I took a look at their Masters&#x2F;PhD programs and under their Research section the topics they consider that is noteworthy for them, I&#x27;ve actually worked on in the past. While I&#x27;m not sure how my previous work would compare to what they currently are researching, it does make me interested in a few questions.<p>1) Can a genuine piece of work or research be used to demonstrate enough knowledge that the GPA requirement no longer matters? I know this is probably a case by case basis, but is it even possible?<p>2) Can I, without the oversight of any academic institution (here being only Universities, and not Academic Foundations and the like), submit&#x2F;publish genuine research papers?

Since a young age I&#x27;ve found it incredibly difficult to reason about and form an argument for or against a topic.

No matter how much I tried, I simply could not reason about the different materials and which one would be better.<p>12 years on and I now have a PhD in computer science.  I find software development extremely straightforward and the accompanying decision making easy. But during design discussions before development takes place, I still find it very difficult to present a reasoned argument as to why I&#x27;d design a piece of software one way over another. I mostly rely on an internal feeling that either provides positive or negative emotions (intuition). Project level decisions are also affected by this.<p>The absence of reasoned argument is not due to a lack of trying. When I attempt to reason about a problem I struggle to think of the questions I should be asking. Thoughts about a topic do not come naturally, and often they are very cyclic and disjointed. It is only through writing down my thoughts that my argument gains clarity.

HN, I&#x27;m Roshan and I&#x27;m part of the team that&#x27;s launching the Placekey today at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;placekey.io. It is a free and open universal standard identifier we built so that data pertaining to places can be shared across organizations easily.<p>A Placekey is a short identifier that has Address and POI sections detailing What is at a place and a section describing Where on the globe the place is. Eventually, there will be a Placekey for every place in the world, even those without postal addresses. US geospatial data from a large array of partners https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.placekey.io&#x2F;partners can already be associated and cross-referenced using Placekey. By allowing every place to be represented by a canonical string, data scientists and researchers can easily join datasets and share geospatial information with each other.<p>Generating a Placekey will always be free, whether you do so using https:&#x2F;&#x2F;placekey.io or the API available at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.placekey.io. And storing a Placekey is permitted for any reason, whether you want to cache it, use it to exchange information with someone else, or to fulfill any other purpose you can think of.<p>Finally, any requests you make to the Placekey API are completely private. They will be used to improve Placekey&#x27;s matching and resolution, but will never be shared with or sold to third parties.<p>Some more details are in our:<p>* FAQ - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;placekey.io&#x2F;faq<p>* API Documentation - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.placekey.io&#x2F;<p>Try generating one at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;placekey.io&#x2F;  No signup required.\nLet us know your thoughts!","time":1602002002,"title":"Show HN: Placekey – An ID for Every Place","type":"story"},{"by":"pbhowmic","descendants":153,"id":24699562,"kids":[24701275,24702414,24701440,24702029,24705484,24701850,24701427,24701260,24704695,24702628,24702314,24705009,24702063,24702857,24705732,24706523,24702309,24703612,24701690,24701892,24702334,24704686,24713285,24704508,24704276,24702163,24704135,24705708,24705449,24701437,24702446,24702615,24702034,24703906,24701913,24701797],"score":216,"time":1602001717,"title":"Cellmate: Male chastity gadget hack could lock users in","type":"story","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54436575"},{"by":"Hooke","descendants":18,"id":24699547,"kids":[24706145,24705601,24709992,24705718,24706040,24715177,24707015,24707850,24705757],"score":34,"time":1602001660,"title":"Charles Babbage’s Observations on Street Nuisances (1864)","type":"story","url":"https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/observations-on-street-nuisances-charles-babbage"},{"by":"sciurus","descendants":64,"id":24699534,"kids":[24707446,24709751,24704676,24705512,24707900,24711147,24708040,24709726,24708444,24707676,24709108,24704770,24710508,24708201,24709691],"score":98,"time":1602001616,"title":"Eliminating Task Processing Outages by Replacing RabbitMQ with Apache Kafka","type":"story","url":"https://doordash.engineering/2020/09/03/eliminating-task-processing-outages-with-kafka/"},{"by":"DocFeind","descendants":9,"id":24699537,"kids":[24703000,24707504,24710690,24727477,24702111],"score":22,"time":1602001628,"title":"Tables, a Product from Area 120, by Google: One tool, many uses","type":"story","url":"https://tables.area120.google.com/u/0/about#/"},{"by":"gregorymichael","descendants":106,"id":24699448,"kids":[24706763,24706571,24706616,24706589,24706976,24706739,24711040,24706559,24707622,24707007,24706860,24707151,24706786,24715833,24706555,24709375,24707471,24706911],"score":123,"time":1602001329,"title":"Teaching our five year old to code by cheating","type":"story","url":"https://baugues.com/cheat-code/"},{"by":"rustoo","descendants":42,"id":24699427,"kids":[24699854,24699959,24701147,24699861,24700176,24702779,24720191,24704943,24703859,24700102,24700884,24699776],"score":168,"time":1602001268,"title":"Remote learning isn’t new: Radio instruction in the 1937 polio epidemic","type":"story","url":"https://theconversation.com/remote-learning-isnt-new-radio-instruction-in-the-1937-polio-epidemic-143797"},{"by":"vapormache","descendants":6,"id":24699371,"kids":[24702070,24702569,24701140],"score":15,"time":1602001055,"title":"Vapor – Decentralized Web over Bitcoinized HTTP","type":"story","url":"https://vapor.network"},{"by":"prismatic","descendants":3,"id":24699122,"kids":[24705683,24705084,24705743],"score":30,"time":1601999939,"title":"Caravaggio Destroyed (and Saved) Painting","type":"story","url":"https://www.vulture.com/article/caravaggio-baroque-paintings.html"},{"by":"DamnInteresting","descendants":5,"id":24699104,"kids":[24706010,24708432,24708915],"score":23,"time":1601999840,"title":"Scientists explore ways to use mineral waste from mines to pull CO2 from the air","type":"story","url":"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/10/06/1009374/asbestos-could-be-a-powerful-weapon-against-climate-change-you-read-that-right/"},{"by":"whereistimbo","descendants":2,"id":24699054,"kids":[24763494,24736373],"score":1,"time":1601999579,"title":"Kriya Yoga in the Bhagavad Gita","type":"story","url":"http://yogananda.com.au/gita/gita0429k2.html"},{"by":"constantinum","descendants":2,"id":24698795,"kids":[24700423,24698845],"score":5,"time":1601998392,"title":"Chargebee raises $55M to help businesses move to subscriptions","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/chargebee-raises-55-million-to-help-businesses-move-to-subscriptions/"},{"by":"codeapple","descendants":2,"id":24698781,"kids":[24698799,24702845],"score":4,"text":"It seems Google and Microsoft have had some difficult publishing Stadia&#x2F;xCloud apps to the App Store due to Apple&#x27;s current polices.

We start the event with rapid pitches by founders -- like Demo Day, but for engineers instead of investors -- to give you a quick way to survey the companies. There is also custom software to let you easily like the ones that stood out, so founders can reach out to you.<p>After the pitches, we open up an expo hall (again, all virtual) to give you a chance to meet founders and early employees, learn more about the domain and technology, and hear about open roles. We’ve been experimenting with the format over the last few months, and recent participants of YC events say it’s just as good as our past in-person events. (Thank goodness!)<p>We aim to have 40 or so YC startups attend and give pitches, with a bias towards ones that have graduated in more recent YC batches (W20, S20). These startups are vetted by YC and have raised a healthy round of funding. A good number of the roles they are hiring for are in engineering and design, but there will also be non-tech roles as well.<p>Working at a startup isn’t for everyone, and many HN users will be the first to point that out. Justin Kan, a former YC partner himself, has this great post on what you will and won’t get out of working at a startup, and it’s pretty accurate: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.atrium.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;work-at-a-startup&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.atrium.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;work-at-a-startup&#x2F;</a><p>That said, we’re finding more people are joining YC startups this year, and for a variety of reasons: to pursue something better aligned with their values, to have a bigger impact through their work, to grow skills in ways that their current jobs won’t allow, and (yes) to seek out “the next big thing”.<p>If you might be considering something new -- or even if you’re just curious to know what’s out there -- we welcome you to join YC and our founders for an informative and efficient evening of networking, job hunting or just seeing if startups are for you.<p><a

However, I don&#x27;t know what the rumors are going to be and I don&#x27;t know what the name of the sanctum will be.

Also, the reason that the sanctum was abandoned must be unclear and mystical. Also, the sanctum must have somewhat of a horrifying past and it has to look like it was abandoned 10 to 40 years ago. The name of the game is Mystical Sanctum Ruins.<p>I am also looking for people to help me make the game itself, but my biggest priority is getting ideas for the game. So if you want you can ask me to let you help with the code part. Also, if you do ask me to let you help with the code part, there is a very high chance that I will let you help. Just saying I will give you credit for helping me, even if you just gave me ideas for the game, I will still give you credit for at least giving something to the production of the game.<p>The game will not be making money, so if you do decide to help with the coding part, then don&#x27;t expect to be paid because you will not be paid, you will just receive credit for helping. Also, I don&#x27;t know how long it will take to make the game, but when the game is ready to be released, the first ones to know about its release will be all who have received credit for helping. Also, when the game comes out, the game will be free to play and a single-player game.","time":1601915290,"title":"I am making a game and I don't know what it should be about","type":"story"},{"by":"tsar_nikolai","descendants":3,"id":24689252,"kids":[24689286,24689335,24689299],"score":2,"time":1601915438,"title":"Facebook says breaking off WhatsApp and Instagram would cost billions of dollars","type":"story","url":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-says-government-breakup-of-instagram-whatsapp-would-be-complete-nonstarter-11601803800"},{"by":"cjlm","descendants":801,"id":24689247,"kids":[24694375,24693806,24695118,24692782,24691802,24688098,24690835,24691149,24686261,24690999,24686141,24691309,24694748,24690641,24691381,24690569,24690568,24688481,24686213,24686312,24688721,24686070,24691334,24690792,24694258,24688526,24691863,24691190,24691123,24695033,24696141,24691865,24687635,24691268,24691105,24690284,24693304,24691786,24687160,24693803,24692122,24691318,24691919,24687994,24692295,24697013,24692363,24686324,24695028,24695334,24688722,24694537,24691423,24692740,24693639,24694759,24694552,24690728,24685998,24687708,24694469,24694358,24693552,24694335,24706419,24691213,24690517,24699719,24692385,24697227,24690438,24694928,24693400,24692630,24695392,24692138,24690589,24692634,24695380,24691791,24693875,24693719,24696793,24690376,24690374,24691233,24692154,24691085,24695873,24690427,24686053,24690548,24686156,24690219,24694993,24687764,24690248,24690628,24686249,24686005],"score":1041,"time":1601915415,"title":"Missing Covid-19 test data was caused by the ill-thought-out use of Excel","type":"story","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54423988"},{"by":"Mikho","descendants":2,"id":24689119,"kids":[24689211,24705431],"score":3,"time":1601914777,"title":"Google defers 30% in-app commission in India to April 2022 after protests","type":"story","url":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/google-defers-move-to-levy-30-fee-to-april-2022/articleshow/78484208.cms"},{"by":"rmedaer","descendants":41,"id":24689044,"kids":[24690222,24691045,24691347,24690239,24689623,24690729,24692745,24692824,24699124,24694042,24691682,24691512],"score":52,"time":1601914343,"title":"Show HN: URL Shortener Optimized for QR Code","type":"story","url":"https://ku.ag"},{"by":"jamesskarzynski","descendants":44,"id":24689091,"kids":[24692765,24690815,24692495,24691840,24691928,24692221,24689874,24692359,24694817,24692706,24690492,24692839,24689732,24691712,24690622,24689729,24690300],"score":93,"text":"Hi HN!

I’ve posted two to The Workplace[1,2], but my final apprehension is more opinion-based, which I believe the HN community would have a good insight on.<p>I work for a scientific research institution as a software engineer. I have minimal knowledge in the details of the science being done, but the software engineering requirements are orthogonal to this. I’ve picked up a bit and I’m generally interested, but in the six years I’ve worked there, it hasn’t come up enough to warrant the investment. Indeed, there are dedicated staff on the team — two with PhDs in the subject and one with decades of experience — exactly for this purpose.<p>My manager’s argument is that, for the promoted role, I would have to significantly increase my domain knowledge. To an extent, I agree that domain knowledge is useful to perform the job — as a force multiplier — and I don’t have a problem with absorbing some. However, where does one draw the line? Maybe this is facetious, but ultimately it’s all ones and zeros! While it could be argued as diminishing returns in comparison, I believe a better investment (in terms of force multiplication) would be investing further in my engineering skills; especially when a complementary resource readily exists.<p>The obvious answer to my question is, “The amount of domain knowledge you need is the amount your manager wants.” Fair point, but I am trying to analyse the calculus of all this. Paradoxically, employers want employees that are fungible (so they can be easily replaced), but also specialists (so it’s harder for them to move elsewhere). I’m wary — given my other misgivings — that investing energy into a niche domain that I’m not wedded to will make me less employable overall.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;workplace.stackexchange.com&#x2F;q&#x2F;164629&#x2F;67054<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;workplace.stackexchange.com&#x2F;q&#x2F;164632&#x2F;67054","time":1601744893,"title":"Ask HN: How much domain knowledge is enough?","type":"story"},{"by":"aciswhat","descendants":3,"id":24673274,"kids":[24687133,24673281,24673307],"score":3,"time":1601744512,"title":"Show HN: Better Blinkist Front End","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/cktang88/better-blinkist"},{"by":"kchow","descendants":3,"id":24673074,"kids":[24673470,24676230],"score":3,"time":1601742856,"title":"Save your wrists and your time: lose the mouse","type":"story","url":"https://www.kchow.org/post/keyboard-warrior/"},{"by":"blendo","descendants":136,"id":24673106,"kids":[24673603,24674709,24674413,24676930,24673522,24673714,24673717,24674677,24687053,24673872,24674294,24674054,24675452,24674630,24678439,24674116,24675962,24675952,24674036,24674045,24675476,24673563,24676408,24673891],"score":155,"time":1601743099,"title":"Bill introduced to promote prescribed fire intends to reduce fire risk","type":"story","url":"https://wildfiretoday.com/2020/09/24/bill-introduced-to-promote-prescribed-fire-intends-to-reduce-fire-risk/"},{"by":"xeeeeeeeeeeenu","descendants":2,"id":24672644,"kids":[24673040,24672652],"score":1,"time":1601738924,"title":"“True lies” – or what LLVM claims, but fails to deliver","type":"story","url":"https://skanthak.homepage.t-online.de/llvm.html"},{"by":"mddanishyusuf","descendants":6,"id":24672653,"kids":[24674240,24673559,24672716,24672882],"score":6,"time":1601738957,"title":"Experiment with Lifetime Subscription and made $20k in two days","type":"story","url":"https://mohddanish.me/experiment-with-lifetime-subscription-and-made-usd20k-in-48-hours-18"},{"by":"jaytaylor","descendants":236,"id":24672585,"kids":[24675332,24673581,24673213,24672895,24675217,24677046,24674314,24673617,24674174,24674227,24674316,24674766,24674126,24675351,24675380,24673247,24673878,24675321,24674001,24673840],"score":162,"time":1601738391,"title":"For years, Intel sat on its CPU monopoly and now the tide turns against them","type":"story","url":"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4377146-for-years-intel-sat-on-cpu-monopoly-and-now-tide-turns-against"},{"by":"joubert","descendants":56,"id":24672532,"kids":[24672872,24674666,24672916,24675461,24675019,24690179,24676500,24674592,24672832,24673731],"score":114,"time":1601737921,"title":"Morgan Stanley Closes Acquisition of E*TRADE","type":"story","url":"https://www.morganstanley.com/press-releases/morgan-stanley-closes-acquisition-of-e-trade"},{"by":"headalgorithm","descendants":4,"id":24672473,"kids":[24674523,24673505,24673481,24674110],"score":14,"time":1601737404,"title":"Online avatar service Gravatar allows mass collection of user info","type":"story","url":"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/online-avatar-service-gravatar-allows-mass-collection-of-user-info/"},{"by":"bumbledraven","descendants":161,"id":24672463,"kids":[24672727,24674287,24673203,24673244,24672995,24672696,24672705,24673763,24673395,24672662,24673330,24673217,24672740,24677660,24672813,24672643,24673060,24677312,24673533,24672840,24672747,24677276,24675740,24674178,24673504,24710800,24676486,24673344,24673370,24673779,24674009,24738443,24676997,24673045,24676303,24672869,24674067,24674025,24672635],"score":321,"time":1601737320,"title":"Color blindness","type":"story","url":"https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2020/09/color-blindness-is-inaccurate-term.html"},{"by":"gervwyk","descendants":8,"id":24672320,"kids":[24672668,24672513,24672661,24672565],"score":5,"text":"I’m launching an open source framework project soon and really want to make sure that the community around the OS framework has a place to contribute to community discussions.

After about 6 months of self study, I decided I wanted to work for a webhosting company, and that I really wanted to work in the hosting&#x2F;server&#x2F;datacenter&#x2F;Linux environment. So NOC Technician is basically where it’s at for that sort of thing to get a foot in the door.<p>I was hanging out in an IRC channel for a local Linux user group, and lo and behold, there was a guy who worked in a local datacenter&#x2F;hosting company. I got the manager contact from him, and basically called and emailed and bothered the hell out of him until he relented and said OK come work as an unpaid intern. I worked hard, learned and incredible amount there (they hired me on after a few weeks, albeit very cheaply of course)— DNS&#x2F;network&#x2F;webserver&#x2F;troubleshooting, all the fundamentals, and there were incredibly smart and brilliant people there that I learned from. Those were very cool days.<p>From there I kept learning and have done fairly decently for myself.

I don&#x27;t know how common this is, but I don&#x27;t have words for most the stuff I do. I tend to think of things visually then struggle to convert those visual ideas into words.<p>I was trying to explain to a friend how interviews go for me recently and the best example I could think of is that it&#x27;s like trying to answer the question, &quot;how would you go about walking in a straight line?&quot;.

I guess I use my brain to communicate with the muscles in my legs somehow, but other than that I don&#x27;t really know how I do it. It&#x27;s very similar with code for me. Arrow functions aren&#x27;t &quot;arrow functions&quot; they&#x27;re just, `() =&gt; {}`.<p>It really gets me down because I know I&#x27;m technically far more capable than I&#x27;m able to demonstrate verbally, but I can&#x27;t prove it without being in a job for a few months and consistently demonstrating my technical ability.<p>Does anyone have any advice for someone like me?

everyone, so I&#x27;m in my mid-twenties, no debt, 1 years worth of salary in savings + index funds, work in software development in Canada, I have about a years worth of experience and I&#x27;m stuck in a rut. I don&#x27;t enjoy working for the company that I currently work for because there&#x27;s no opportunity for growth or advancement, and I&#x27;m a brainless blob because of how precise the tasks have to be completed. It&#x27;d actually be better for me to get a lobotomy.<p>I save more than half of my income after tax so I am hoping for an early retirement but I can&#x27;t guarantee it.<p>I try to constantly solve problems in my life and post them to GitHub. I have many many many projects on the go but none of which are really sellable. I&#x27;m trying to constantly produce as much as I can in hopes that I&#x27;ll develop something that someone else might find worth using.<p>I&#x27;d like to be an entrepreneur but it&#x27;s a lot more work than creating a startup and getting passive income; it&#x27;s highly risky and there&#x27;s a high chance I&#x27;ll lose my entire investment. I posted an idea to reddit which got significant attention (thousands of votes, hundreds of comments) and a lot of good questions and answers for my business idea but nobody outside of reddit finds it interesting.<p>I want to work in security but I don&#x27;t have the credentials. I found a bug in Facebook&#x27;s email-code two factor authentication many years ago which allowed the user to enter at least 30 codes incorrectly before entering in the right one. I reported it, they said it was not an issue but then fixed it a month later and I could only enter in three before getting locked out. Found vulnerabilities in other websites that exposed enough info to file a tax return for some.<p>I don&#x27;t really see the point of doing things anymore. I&#x27;m super tired all of the time but my nutrition macros are ok according to some apps. Doctor says I&#x27;m fine so I&#x27;m probably just lazy.<p>What would you suggest that I do to get unstuck?","time":1601596249,"title":"Ask HN: Bored, stuck in a rut.

The data warehouse, modeled as a star schema, grew to over 700 data models from 3000+ raw production tables. Every time we wanted to make a change or build a new analysis, it took forever as we had to deal with managing the complexity of these 700 different models. With all these layers of dependencies and stakeholders constantly demanding more data, we ended up making lots of mistakes (i.e. dashboard metrics not matching). These mistakes led to loss of trust and soon our stakeholders were off buying tools (Heap, Mixpanel, Amplitude, Wave Analytics, etc…) to do their own analysis.<p>With a star schema (also core to recently IPO-ed Snowflake), you build the tables you need for reporting and BI on top of fact tables (what you want to measure, i.e. leads, sales…) and dimension tables (how you want to slice your data, i.e. gender, company, contract size…). Using this approach, the amount of fact and dimension tables grow in size and complexity in relation to the number of questions &#x2F; datasets &#x2F; metrics that need to be answered by the business. Over time the rate of new questions increases rapidly and data teams spend more time updating models and debugging mismatched numbers than answering data questions.<p>What if instead of using the hundreds of fact and dimension tables in a star schema, we could use one table with all your customer data modeled as a collection of core customer actions (each a single source of truth), and combine them together to assemble any table at the moment the data analyst needs that table? Numbers would always match (single source of truth), any new question could be answered immediately without waiting on data engineering to build new fact and dimension tables (assembled when the data analyst needs it), and investigating issues would be easy (no nested dependencies of fact and dimension tables that depend on other tables). After several iterations, Narrator was born.<p>Narrator uses a single 11-column table called the Activity Stream to represent all the data in your data warehouse. It’s built from sql transformations that transform a set of raw production tables (for example, Zendesk data) into activities (ticket opened, ticket closed, etc). Each row of the Activity Stream has a customer, a timestamp, an activity name, a unique identifier, and a bit of metadata describing it.<p>Creating any table from this single model made up of activities that don’t obviously relate to each other is hard to imagine. Unlike star schema, we don’t use foreign keys (the direct relationships in relational databases that connect objects, like employee.company_id → company.id) because they don’t always exist when you’re dealing with data in multiple systems.<p>Instead each activity has a customer identifier which we use, along with time, to automatically join within the single table to generate datasets.<p>As an example, imagine you were investigating a single customer who called support. Did they visit the web site before that call? You’d look at that customer’s first web visit, and see if that person called before their next web visit.<p>Now imagine finding all customers who behaved this way per month -- you’d have to take a drastically different approach with your current data tools. Narrator, by contrast, always joins data in terms of behavior. The same approach you take to investigate a single customer applies to all of them. For the above example you’d ask Narrator’s Dataset tool to show all users who visited the website and called before the next visit, grouped by month.<p>We started as a consultancy to build out the approach and prove that this was possible. We supported eight companies per Narrator data analyst, and now we’re excited for more data folks to get their hands on it so y’all can experience the same benefits.<p>We’d love to hear any feedback or answer any questions about our approach. We’ve been using it ourselves in production for three years, but only launched it to the public last week. We’ll answer any comments on this thread and can also set up a video chat for anyone who wants to go more in-depth.","time":1601483439,"title":"Launch HN: Narrator (YC S19) – a data modeling platform

This bug is so severe that it was hard for me to believe when I encountered it, but anyone can easily verify this for themself.<p>In particular, your account&#x27;s Local Items keychain, which is used by Safari and some other Apple applications to store passwords, is encrypted in such a way that it can only be restored onto the exact same machine — knowing the user&#x27;s password is insufficient. Thus, if your machine is lost, stolen, or damaged, a restore from Time Machine backup will not properly restore your keychain. Nor will the keychain properly migrate to another machine using Migration Assistant (luckily, this is how I discovered this behavior).<p>There is no warning of this behavior in any documentation, and no workaround whatsoever except to use a different browser or password manager, or to manually store all passwords yourself separately in the Login (rather than Local Items) keychain.<p>There&#x27;s also no way to export the items in the the Local Items keychain except manually copying them to another keychain, during which you must enter your password one-by-one for each copied item (people have written some AppleScripts to automate this, e.g. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;rmondello&#x2F;b933231b1fcc83a7db0b).<p>If you use iCloud Keychain, then the Local Items keychain is just a machine-local cache of the iCloud data, which is fine, I guess. But this behavior is just dangerously broken if you do not use iCloud for this purpose.<p>(This was originally a comment at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24624001, but it was suggested that it be its own top-level post.)","time":1601380540,"title":"Tell HN: macOS keychains cannot always be restored from backups","type":"story"},{"by":"Garbage","descendants":3,"id":24626966,"kids":[24627027,24626975],"score":4,"time":1601383064,"title":"Time Travel Theoretically Possible Without Leading to Paradoxes, Researchers Say","type":"story","url":"https://www.npr.org/2020/09/27/917556254/paradox-free-time-travel-is-theoretically-possible-researchers-say"},{"by":"pseudolus","descendants":3,"id":24626546,"kids":[24642946,24643189],"score":15,"time":1601380409,"title":"Early Works by Edward Hopper Found to Be Copies of Other Artists","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/28/arts/design/edward-hopper-copies-paintings.html"},{"by":"el_oni","descendants":3,"id":24626447,"kids":[24626702,24629720],"score":2,"text":"I use a bunch of scientific instruments that initially output their data in binary formats and which require the instrument software to output as a Ascii, csv, xml (etc.) File.<p>Is there a way to deserialise the data without the software?

In the U.S., we are on the verge of a wave of evictions, and people are disenfranchised with the political system. Whether it fails to create meaningful change or whether it&#x27;s even intended to is not irrelevant but effectively the same.<p>What does all this mean for software developers?  We program and oil the industrial complex, the system that is jeopardizing our very survival.  Software engineers have brought tremendous efficiency gains resulting in profit gains that as we know are not fairly distributed, and we continue to automate and increase unemployment while our society, in the U.S., lacks essentials like food security and good public housing.  That being said, we are also in a unique position at this point in history.  The world and our economy have become dependent on software.  Should software developers use the economy&#x27;s dependence on software as an opportunity to demand socioeconomic change?

My father and grandfather were also cleaners for the majority of their working lives and often expressed regret before they passed. After some months self-learning I had amassed the courage to start applying for internships and junior jobs. No luck initially, though eventually I was able to begin a data entry job on a 12 month contract. I was finally able to sit at a desk and have a work assigned email address!<p>Half-way into my contract I organised a dozen or so meetups at Google Campus. There I met people who gave me the inspiration to continue applying for jobs. I was a fish out of water but it was a fantastic time. Finally, after another year or so of searching, I received an offer. I was able to jump in at the deep end had full project ownership over critical projects for several international brands. Over the next year I was able to fit in a wealth of experience and saw my career progress nicely as I jumped from project to project.<p>Eventually I was offered the chance to join a small business services company and lead development of financial systems there. I accepted, and I have been here for over half a decade now with some success. However, I now feel woefully under-experienced compared to my peers and sorely need mentorship.<p>I feel hopelessly trapped and constantly on the precipice of professional and personal catastrophe. I am not fit the for job market as a senior engineer, and I no longer have the financial means to take a step back into a less senior role at a company with a larger engineering team.<p>My scenario is certainly not unique but I have no peers to discuss this issue with so I am reaching out to HN for stern and dispassionate advice.","time":1601122854,"title":"Ask HN: I am “trapped” in a senior engineering role, how can I escape?","type":"story"},{"by":"hexbinencoded","descendants":12,"id":24598253,"kids":[24602450,24605841,24599472,24601120,24600018,24600790,24601325,24599528,24599406],"score":19,"text":"I&#x27;m looking for a compact, reliable 5 GHz WiFi-bridge that either has 1 Gigabit port that can bridge multiple Ethernet MAC addresses or 4x 1 GbE ports that can do the same.

The main benefit is that students can pause the video and edit the code whenever they want.<p>We think this is needed is because over 70% of people who are trying to learn to code today use videos. But since videos aren’t interactive, students end up mirroring the instructors’ code line-by-line in their local code editors. This is time consuming, and it often causes problems with local dev environment setup.<p>Scrimba solves these problems as it enables students to pause the screencast and modify the instructors’ code directly inside the player. So when a Scrimba student feels confused, she jumps into the screencast and plays around with the code (editing, running, debugging) until she’s made sense of it. As a consequence, she learns faster.<p>Technically, this is possible because we have merged the IDE and the video player into one tool. To understand the technology in-depth, please watch this cast: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scrimba.com&#x2F;scrim&#x2F;cww679T9\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scrimba.com&#x2F;scrim&#x2F;cww679T9</a><p>The Scrimba format also opens the way for other features that can further enhance the learning experience, like searching inside videos, in-video hyperlinks, audiovisual code feedback from teachers, remote pair programming between students, and more. The more we work with the format, the more of these opportunities we see. So we have decided to use the format as the backbone for an online coding school as we continue to improve it.<p>After launching a bunch of shorter courses the last couple of years, we launched our first full-degree program this summer. It&#x27;s called “The Frontend Developer Career Path” and it contains 75 hours of content and 100s of interactive coding challenges. It costs $19 per month and the teachers are well-known instructors like Gary Simon, Cassidy Williams, and Kevin Powell. Students are also paired up in Study Groups, in order to make the online learning experience feel less lonely. So far, over 3000 people from 110 different countries have enrolled.<p>Here’s a link to the course: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scrimba.com&#x2F;learn&#x2F;frontend\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scrimba.com&#x2F;learn&#x2F;frontend</a><p>Fun fact: Scrimba is built entirely in Imba, a programming language that our CTO has created. It’s a Ruby-inspired language that compiles to JavaScript, and it excels at creating high-performant web apps.

I&#x27;m Wen Bo from alto.lol (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alto.lol). I&#x27;m building a safe virtual space for students who attend the same university to meet and connect via video chat. It&#x27;s like Zoom breakout rooms but any user is free to create&#x2F;join&#x2F;leave rooms and invite others to a room.<p>I moved to San Francisco, away from my family and friends, a few months before the start of Covid. I was still working for my job back in NYC and was the only one on my team who was fully remote. The isolation from my co-workers was challenging but video chatting with them on a regular basis helped with the transition.<p>After I was laid off, I began experimenting with real-time communication apps to alleviate the isolation that people felt due to working remotely and sheltering in place. I also searched for volunteer opportunities on helpwithcovid.com and worked with a project owner on ideating and planning a video chat app he wanted to build.<p>Around early August, I learned that a number of universities were going to be either fully remote or limit capacity on campus for the fall semester. I envisioned a video chat app where students were free to hang out and meet new classmates since it&#x27;d be difficult, if not impossible, to do so in person.<p>Alto (short for Alone Together) enables you to sign up with your university email, enter the lobby, and:<p>1) join a room where other classmates are already chatting<p>2) invite a classmate that is in the lobby to chat<p>3) create a room and send the link to your school friends to start chatting<p>I&#x27;ve worked with Python&#x2F;JS for the past three years, but after being laid off, I wanted to try something new. I heard great things about Elixir back in my product management days, so I spent the last month learning a new stack (Elixir&#x2F;Phoenix&#x2F;LiveView&#x2F;Tailwind) and building the MVP. Video chat is built using WebRTC.<p>I&#x27;m happy to share this project with the HN community!

Hydrogen fuel cell stocks such as PLUG and FCEL have gone up 10x despite the lack of any significant new breakthrough technology and a history of loss making and value destruction.<p>Just today, Bank of America research released a 103 page &quot;Hydrogen Primer&quot; in which they predict that the hydrogen space will generate $2.5 trillion in direct revenues and $11 trillion of indirect infrastructure potential. They believe that a tipping point is coming soon because of the falling cost of renewable energy and electrolysers used to produce &quot;green&quot; hydrogen, as well as better efficiencies in fuel cells.<p>My question is for the experts in the crowd here, either based on engineering experience or on first principles and physics, does this seem likely to you? Why do we really need hydrogen? It seems we are getting to the point where wind power and particularly solar power are now cost effective. Once we have better batteries for storage, what problem do we have left that requires hydrogen to solve?

questions such as usage of serverless technologies, organizational experience, and more.<p>The second section covers the benefits and downsides of the technology as well as the most popular use cases and tools to get the most out of serverless technology.<p>The final part of this report highlights the key decision-makers when it comes to adopting serverless technology. We also wanted to hear the opinions of those who are not using serverless technology, to learn more about the reasons why they haven’t adopted it.<p>Here&#x27;s a collection of several key findings based on the community&#x27;s answers:<p>1. Currently AWS is the leading provider followed by Azure and Google Cloud.<p>2. The two biggest benefits of using serverless architecture are flexibility in scaling and speed of development.<p>3. Node<i></i>.js<i></i> is the most widespread programming language when it comes to serverless, with Python in second place.<p>4. The most common use case for serverless is rest APIs, and the second is data processing tasks.<p>5. The biggest challenge for developers working with serverless is debugging. By far. Architectural complexity is not even close in second place.","time":1600864646,"title":"Serverless Trends

I&#x27;m hoping you smart people out here can help me.<p>For the last week I&#x27;ve been working on an exact-pattern-matching solution, and my code hit the limit to what&#x27;s possible on my machine. On my win10&#x2F;7300HQ&#x2F;2667MHz single channel DDR4, running mostly isolated on a single core, it crunches through 512megs (random [a-z,A-Z]) in 58 milliseconds (faster with actually random data) looking for a Needle the size of 8 bytes, but it&#x27;s not fixed to that length.<p>I wanted to compare it to ripgrep, but there&#x27;s no way of getting the numbers for its comparison algorithm <i>only</i>, so it&#x27;d be unfair.<p>Short of scavenging github for (apparently mostly) C code (which I don&#x27;t speak, and I really want to avoid installing Visual Studio)\nto use for comparing, I don&#x27;t know what to do. Worse, looking through the code I&#x27;ve found, despite not speaking it,\nmade it look pretty obvious that all these solutions out there aren&#x27;t going to beat mine,\nbecause they contain far more instructions, memory accesses and comparisons&#x2F;branches than my own.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to brag. I&#x27;m rather desperate and hoping that someone can help me solving my problem.<p>Is there a benchmark suite of some sorts (a binary?) I can download and feed with my own haystack&#x2F;needle?\nIs there some &quot;known to be fastest&quot; pattern matching program I&#x27;m unaware of, which I could use for comparing?<p>And what <i>is</i> the gold standard for exact pattern matching anyway?\nI know of Rabin-Karp, Boyer-Moore, but I&#x27;m not convinced they actually qualify for full range pattern matching,\ninstead of looking for <i>text</i> strings specifically.<p>PS: To give you some context about me: When it comes to programming, my friend says:\n&quot;[he] isn&#x27;t happy until the speed of his code approaches the theoretical limits of light.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve hit the limits on my machine short of running it on multiple cores,\nbut there&#x27;s no point in doing so when I can&#x27;t compare it to anything.<p>Thank you for any possible help&#x2F;advice you can give me.<p>(My apologies for the formatting.

I wanted to ask if you had recommendations for something that feels more productive.<p>I&#x27;m writing the backend in Go, and the frontend in Vue. I&#x27;m also using GraphQL. So my development looks like:<p>- Write logic in Go<p>- Write GraphQL resolvers in Go<p>- Write relevant Vue components for GraphQL<p>- Look up the syntax for Vue-baesd web components I&#x27;m using (eg, Vue+Bootstrap)<p>- Compile&#x2F;minify my Vue code<p>- Run my Go program<p>If I had chosen to write this as I have in the past: server-side HTML templating and rendering, then I&#x27;d be done with the project by now! How can I improve my productivity without spending so much time in documentation or switching between different languages and code bases? My pain points are:<p>- It would be nice to use mostly normal HTML, or web components, without having to look up the syntax for every element every time I want to create a button.<p>- It would be nice to have some sort of automatic binding between form elements and server side processing. GraphQL makes this easy, as does DOM binding in Vue, to avoid the tedium of writing POST form parsing logic and special templating for indicating errors.<p>- It would also be nice to be able to use the same language, or the same code base. Right now, the server and client really do feel like distinct code bases, even though they&#x27;re in the same repo.<p>How can I implement this such that my code feels as productive as using plain old HTML and templating, but with the UX touches, and developer productivity gains, with more modern tooling?","time":1600484913,"title":"Ask HN: Recommendations for a more productive web framework?","type":"story"},{"by":"barbanegra","descendants":4,"id":24524497,"kids":[24531150,24525924,24526859,24527798],"score":5,"text":"Was it a friend&#x27;s recommendation?

For example table design - holds a lot of data, needs to support complex filtering, a lot of contextual actions, etc.<p>Most of the content online focuses on consumer products and the knowledge barely applies in enterprise products.<p>It would be great to see if you guys know any in-depth resources (preferably books).","time":1600443270,"title":"Ask HN: Does anyone know any good resources for enterprise UX design?","type":"story"},{"by":"canada_dry","descendants":3,"id":24518024,"kids":[24518063,24527961],"score":3,"time":1600442981,"title":"Huawei floats an agreement that “promises a no-backdoor and no-spying” for 5G","type":"story","url":"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-morning-update-huawei-canada-draws-up-no-backdoor-no-spying-legal/"},{"by":"GChevalier","descendants":0,"id":24518027,"kids":[24518430,24518282,24518499,24518424],"score":27,"time":1600443014,"title":"Neuraxle – A Clean Machine Learning Framework","type":"story","url":"https://www.neuraxle.org/"},{"by":"simulo","descendants":305,"id":24518295,"kids":[24520116,24518637,24519371,24518696,24520212,24518573,24520231,24519081,24519634,24520729,24519116,24522245,24518693,24519194,24521966,24519196,24519123,24519379,24519113,24519450,24519984,24525739,24520738,24522455,24519362,24519130,24519105,24520518,24663232,24518577],"score":768,"time":1600444242,"title":"Vue.js 3","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next/releases/tag/v3.0.0"},{"by":"nikital","descendants":30,"id":24517925,"kids":[24520351,24520271,24519419,24521441,24524137,24526004,24519598,24526463,24523746,24532183,24522390,24519389,24519551,24519670,24525559,24526109],"score":309,"time":1600442541,"title":"Show HN: ugit – Learn Git Internals by Building Git in Python","type":"story","url":"https://www.leshenko.net/p/ugit/"},{"by":"jitbit","descendants":4,"id":24517904,"kids":[24517972,24518052,24522481,24519661],"score":2,"time":1600442441,"title":"Latest Chrome disables Notifications consent popup","type":"story","url":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63954229/notification-requestpermissions-no-dialog-shown-automatically-blocked-messa"},{"by":"a5withtrrs","descendants":217,"id":24517825,"kids":[24522818,24522938,24522861,24522886,24525553,24524085,24522911,24522935,24522912,24526097,24524401,24522755,24526292,24522826,24527224,24526507,24526735,24522784,24525642,24522887,24524036,24526154,24564848,24523221,24523400,24522856,24523548,24524622,24525591],"score":323,"time":1600442152,"title":"It was more efficient to blow up a real 747 than to use miniatures or CGI","type":"story","url":"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546992/why-christopher-nolan-actually-blew-up-a-real-plane-for-tenet"},{"by":"adamnemecek","descendants":134,"id":24517824,"kids":[24518342,24519181,24518048,24517988,24517946,24519829,24519542,24519745,24519864,24526403,24523091,24519487,24525850,24519652,24520712,24527545,24520069,24522074,24518043,24520512],"score":398,"time":1600442151,"title":"rg3d: Rust 3D game engine with an FPS demo game and scene editor","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/mrDIMAS/rg3d"},{"by":"dddddaviddddd","descendants":68,"id":24517792,"kids":[24520884,24522471,24519460,24526609,24521541,24521515,24525704,24520879,24522740,24528292,24526231,24548162,24522465,24524746,24522206,24522921,24522172,24519601,24524204],"score":272,"time":1600442025,"title":"Iron, How Did They Make It?
