We give parents of young children access to a dedicated expert in child development. When your kid stops sleeping through the night, starts having meltdowns, or is struggling in preschool, instead of frantically Googling things, we give you personal access to someone with expertise, who you can know and trust.<p>As parents, we know how hard it can be. One of us, Elizabeth, has a 5-year-old and is pregnant while going through YC. (She&#x27;s amazing! And at the same time it&#x27;s a heavy load.)  We know it can feel that work takes up so much energy that there’s none left over for your kids, and paradoxically at the same time it can feel that all your energy is taken up by your kids and there’s none left for work. We’re all trying to create the best environment for our child, but the day to day reality of that can feel really hard.<p>And our support systems have changed dramatically; we’ve often moved away from the close-knit communities and extended families that used to be the norm. And when we go online we see an overwhelming amount of advice that’s often contradictory and just doesn’t feel applicable to our specific situation.<p>As well as being parents, we have a background in child development. Elizabeth is a clinical child psychologist, Tom has worked extensively in EdTech, and Catalin has applied ML to child behavioral health out of Stanford. We came together because of a shared appreciation for how crucial the home environment is for a child’s development, and a shared confusion as to why support for parents is so impersonal. We can’t think of another field that is as complex as child development where outside support and access to expertise isn&#x27;t the norm.<p>So we created Trustle! We want to bridge the gap between parents and expertise. Whether it’s to solve a specific problem like sleep or behavioral challenges, or it’s to proactively prepare the right environment, Trustle gives parents a dedicated coach.<p>When a parent signs up we ask a few questions and match them with a suitable expert who is then available through video chat, phone, and in-app messaging whenever the parent needs them. All our experts have a least a decade of experience working with families and young children, a minimum of a master’s in early childhood development, and go through a fairly rigorous selection process.<p>We deeply appreciate how personal the parenting journey is. Our role is not to push our own beliefs. Instead, our coaches get to know families, and then use this relationship, paired with knowledge about child development and learning, to come up with solutions that work for their children, their goals, and their beliefs.<p>On the experts’ side, we use technology to amplify their ability to work with parents. First, technology can make them more efficient.  We can create an automated ‘assistant’ for the coach that can surface the right information at the right time, and support the coach by preparing repetitive and unambiguous tasks.  Second, we&#x27;ll keep them up to date on the latest in child development research, as well as using the power of the network by giving coaches access to each other&#x27;s learning and experience.<p>There’s no one-sized fits all ‘solution’ in raising children, which is why there is so much impersonal, contradictory information online that leads to parents feeling confused. We want to help parents cut through that, and figure out what works for them.<p>We know there are many parents on HN, including those with young children right now - we’d love to hear about your experiences and needs around this.

I&#x27;d really like to make something that&#x27;s more of a tool than just an app. Think &quot;mobile phones in airplanes tracking your rental fleet&quot; over &quot;weather app&quot;.<p>Any direction-pointing is very welcome!","time":1583431210,"title":"Ask HN: What industries are underserved by software?","type":"story"},{"by":"jkuria","descendants":4,"id":22495759,"kids":[22497221,22499079,22497118],"score":16,"time":1583429320,"title":"YC CEO: “Not Drowning in Demand?

They seemed pretty helpful and at the end asked if there were any types of customers we were interested in connecting with. They followed up with an introduction to a (real, well known) company that fit our profile and I had a decent, though, in retrospect somewhat peculiar, conversation with someone who worked there (verified through LinkedIn and company email address) and was looking to address a problem that our product solves.

HN,<p>We’re Kim and Donald from Entry Level (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;entrylevel.io). Entry Level, is a job board for students, recent grads, career changes, and individuals with less than 3 years of experience.<p>As current fullstack bootcamp students, both of us struggled to find jobs targeting beginners breaking into tech. Most jobs we would apply for require 3+ years of experience making it hard for us. We’d often go from website to website to find entry-level opportunities and I wanted to create a job board that has all the info I want from the multiple sites I visit frequently.<p>So we made Entry Level to help others struggling to find that first job like us. With Entry Level, you can search through all of our jobs from lots of different sources. If you’d like to apply for a job, it links you back to the source. How it works is simple, you just search and click on a job that interests you and apply.<p>We aggregate the data through the use of elastic search, but before that, we made multiple scripts that run on a cron job that gathers data from multiple sites. After gathering the data, the script then forwards it to our elastic search instance then we filter by a specific query that would filter all entry-level jobs. Then after the filtering process, we direct the data to our Postgres database and render it on our front end. Aside from that we also use other job boards APIs to increase the value of our content.<p>Goals for finishing MVP:\n- Categorizing job titles - A lot of jobs posted on Entry Level are from a wide variety of categories. We want to niche down and focus on tech jobs as of right now.\n- Pagination - Entry Level has hundreds of jobs within it’s database and adding pagination will help users find more jobs within a tech category. \n- Searchable tags\n- Site loading Async&#x2F;Await\n- Email Mailing List\n- Post Jobs<p>We just launched our beta and would love to get your feedback!What would make your job process easier?

We help companies quickly build internal tools to track and execute human-in-the-loop workflows.<p>We’re built specifically for technology companies that have manual work behind the scenes. For example, a fintech that has a beautiful mobile-first experience for its end users, likely also has a risk team internally approving new accounts, or reviewing suspicious transactions for anomalies. These teams need tools to get their jobs done, but building those tools is time consuming and often means spending your limited engineering resources on internal tools when you’d much rather invest in building user-facing features.<p>What’s more, maintenance of these tools is an ongoing endeavor. As the company scales and the operations team identifies ways they can improve their workflow, they’re often bottlenecked on engineering availability, forcing the team to implement workarounds in the interim, such as working out of spreadsheets and Slack. These workarounds, while easy to implement, come with pitfalls such as tasks slipping through the cracks or data getting out-of-sync.<p>With Flowdash, we’re combining the best of both worlds. We want to enable the deep integration that comes from building custom software, while making it possible for operations teams to iterate and improve their workflow over time.  We’re able to do this because we’re not trying to be a general-purpose low-code platform, but really focus on use cases where a team of humans works through a backlog of tasks.<p>Flowdash was inspired by our own experience. Omar and I were early engineers at Gusto and over the course of six years, built several internal tools to support our payments, risk, and payroll operations teams. We saw first-hand the benefits of equipping our ops teams with great tools, but also struggled to prioritize improvements to these tools against user-facing features.<p>We think of operations teams as unsung heroes. Their work is critical to the day-to-day operations of the company, yet few people externally know they exist. We want to give them better tools to get their work done.<p>Here’s how it works:<p>Flowdash’s core primitive is a Flow, which we define as a pipeline of work, where tasks move through a set of stages from creation to completion. Every Flow exposes an endpoint where developers can push new tasks with a single POST request. Users then claim tasks and move them along the pipeline. Additionally, actions can be customized in a number of ways, such as sending email, calling a third-party API, or talking back to your main application. Because stages and actions can be customized without code, the end-user can change how they work without requiring engineering intervention. From the developer perspective, you can think of it as a human-powered background job.<p>As a concrete example, let’s consider a fintech onboarding new clients. When a new client signs up, a task is automatically pushed to Flowdash. From there, a risk agent reviews the account and decides whether to Approve or Reject the client. In turn, that action issues a callback to the main application to complete onboarding. Here’s a 3-min video setting this up end-to-end: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flowdash.com&#x2F;demo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flowdash.com&#x2F;demo</a>.<p>We’re excited (and a little intimidated) to be on HN today, and would love to get your feedback. Have you had to build similar tools? What were some of the pain points or challenges?

and Petr here from Raycast (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.raycast.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.raycast.com</a>). We are building a command-line inspired native app to save developers time on non-coding tasks, such as managing active sprints in Jira, sorting out notifications in GitHub, or checking metrics in Amplitude.<p>Both of us are software engineers and we noticed that we were spending less time coding and more time managing the software development process. We had to keep track of bug reports, manage sprints, comment on pull requests, release new versions and many more things that eat up a big portion of our time. All of those tasks are spread across web tools that aren&#x27;t optimized for power users. When we used these tools every day, loading times became annoying, animations turned into pain and clicking 10 buttons for the simplest things didn&#x27;t feel right.<p>We built an internal productivity tool that addresses this issues in our previous jobs at Facebook as a side project. It was a desktop app for macOS that sits in the menu bar and connects to the internal issue tracker. The app displays your open issues and has a global shortcut to create a new one. The tool allowed us to replace the slow web app for the majority of our work and saved us time. When other engineers enjoyed the simplicity and speed of the tool, we realized that such an app can be applied to other web tools as well.<p>Everybody has to deal with one of these. Take Jira, for example: to update the status of an issue, you have to open the browser, create a new tab, navigate to the website and find the right issue. Only then can you change the priority. This feels broken! This kind of interaction shouldn&#x27;t take that long. In fact, you should be able to do this without opening a browser, without seeing a loading indicator and without switching context!<p>Raycast is inspired by command line interfaces. These interfaces are a great way to escape from the clutter of typical web tools. They are simple, responsive and extensible. However, they also have drawbacks: rich media elements aren&#x27;t well supported, ASCII characters are too limiting for advanced UI design and it&#x27;s very hard to discover commands. Raycast is our attempt to combine the benefits of a command line with those of a modern user interface. Its UI is similar to Spotlight or Alfred. You can launch the app with a global shortcut, search for commands, and perform quick actions. Similar to CLIs, you execute application-specific commands in Raycast, such as creating an issue in Jira or opening a pull request in GitHub. An integrated store makes it easy to install new extensions.<p>The app is entirely designed to keep developers in the flow. Most important: it&#x27;s fast! Our client-first architecture makes every interaction instant. The app is written natively to deliver the best performance with the least amount of resources. It won&#x27;t drain your laptop battery and it&#x27;s accessible via keyboard shortcuts.<p>Consistency is key to being more productive. Once you&#x27;ve learned how to create an issue in Jira via Raycast, you know how to schedule a meeting in Zoom, create a pull request in GitHub, or set a reminder for tomorrow. All commands follow a similar structure and share UI components to make them look and feel the same. The components are built for speed: Text fields have autocompletions, elements in dropdowns are searchable and automatically remember previous choices. The app doesn&#x27;t require a login and your data is stored encrypted on your local hard drive. All the API requests go directly to the third party services and we don&#x27;t track any sensitive data.<p>At the moment, Raycast is only available for macOS and we&#x27;re focusing on the fastest experience for Jira. Upcoming extensions will include an inbox for your GitHub notifications or utilities such as reminders. We can&#x27;t build all extensions ourselves and believe in an open platform. We will release an API to build custom extensions and use the private beta to make sure that we can provide a great developer experience. We have tons of ideas and would love to hear what would you like to see in a tool like this.","time":1583172490,"title":"Launch HN: Raycast (YC W20) – CLI-inspired desktop app for non-coding tasks","type":"story"},{"by":"andrewfromx","descendants":4,"id":22466910,"kids":[22483475,22469328,22476935],"score":8,"text":"I kinda stumbled into this but wondering if others make a practice of this. I have a macbook, and I have a fedora31 linux machine. Not a VM or something in the cloud, two real physical laptops and I use the mac for 4 hours a day and the linux machine for 4 hours a day.<p>And I&#x27;ve noticed this forces good dev PC hygiene in that I have this rule I never break: no files I need can only be on one hard drive. Also, if I have sample data in one database, I force myself to have an easy way to re-create that sample data for myself 4 hour later. But it&#x27;s not just for myself. This two PC dev system means when the next developer comes on the project there are no surprises of stuff that only works on my 1 machine that did the dev work.<p>And the fear of what if my laptop is stolen goes toward zero since 4 hours later I always start all over on a different laptop.<p>Oh and I get to be BOTH a mac user and a linux user!

These include:<p>- Temporal Random Walks: random walks that respect the time that each edge occurred (stored as edge weights)<p>- Watch Your Step: computes node embeddings by simulating the effect of random walks, rather than doing them<p>- ComplEx: computes embeddings for nodes and edge types in knowledge graphs, and uses these to perform link prediction<p>- Neo4j connector: the GraphSAGE algorithm can execute neighbourhood sampling from a Neo4j database, so the edges of a graph do not have to fit into memory.<p>The new release also incorporates key bug fixes and improvements:<p>- StellarGraph now supports TensorFlow 2.1<p>- Demos now focus on Jupyter notebooks<p>- Supervised GraphSAGE Node Attribute Inference algorithm is now reproducible<p>- Code for saliency maps&#x2F;interpretability refactored to have more sharing, making it cleaner and easier to extend<p>- Demo notebooks predominantly tested on CI using Papermill, so won&#x27;t become out of

We built an at-home physician-ordered DNA test that covers all genes and looks for pathogenic variants related to thousands of rare genetic conditions.<p>Why rare genetic conditions? It may seem like a niche problem but there are ~400 million people worldwide with a rare genetic condition, half of which are currently undiagnosed. To put this into perspective, it’s estimated that 1 in 10 Americans has a rare condition and while each of the individual ~10,000 conditions is rare, the population that suffers such conditions is larger than cancer and HIV combined. Furthermore, for the patients that have been diagnosed, it takes on average 8 years for doctors to identify their conditions. You’ve already heard of rare genetic conditions, you might just not be aware of it. Remember the Ice Bucket Challenge for ALS? Most of these diseases initially look like more common conditions, such as autism, chronic pain, ADHD, or even the flu, before patients get worse. This diagnostic odyssey can be extremely costly for patients and in our experience, some are spending more than $30,000 and seeing more than 10 doctors before they get access to the right specialists and testing.<p>We have seen this problem first-hand. Lukas is a rare-disease expert and worked on the world’s largest rare disease project (the 100,000 genomes project) as a PhD candidate at Oxford University in the UK. I am trained as a theoretical computational astrophysicist and during my PhD and fellowship at Cambridge University and Oxford University, I spent my spare time working with National Healthcare Service doctors developing and publishing medical diagnostics with machine learning. Our original idea was actually slightly different from what we have now. We spent a lot of effort on developing a symptom checker specifically for rare conditions with the idea to comb through existing medical records and flag patients with potential rare genetic conditions because, unsurprisingly, WebMD and others aren&#x27;t really great for this purpose. As we were building this, we realized that for the patients we worked with, even if their symptoms were suggestive of a genetic condition, access to clinical-grade genetic testing was extremely difficult for many as it was either too expensive because insurance wouldn’t cover the cost, or they couldn’t find a doctor that would order it. Thus, we decided to use our expertise to both find these patients more efficiently and built up a service to drastically reduce the time and cost to access clinical-grade genetic testing.<p>About the test:<p>Just like most DNA tests, you can do this from home and it’s noninvasive, all we need is a little saliva. Unlike most DNA tests, ours is physician-ordered, sequenced in a CLIA-accredited and CAP-certified lab, the results are signed out by a licensed clinical lab director, all users have access to genetic counseling, and we try to incorporate as much phenotypic data as possible into the analysis. Our product is a whole-exome sequencing test with 100x coverage and covers all of the more than 20,000 genes, where 85% of known disease-causing variants occur.<p>People always ask, how are you different from 23andme? Looking for a rare genetic condition is kind of like trying to find a typo in a novel. Using a 23andme (or similar) test to look for such a condition is like trying to find a typo in the first Harry Potter novel and stopping after 75 words. Those tests are just not meant for this purpose. Most are based on genotyping arrays that look for very specific variants at predetermined locations in the genome. However, the variants that cause rare diseases can occur anywhere. For example, there are over 1,700 different mutations in the CFTR gene that can cause cystic fibrosis. Approximately 85% of the known pathogenic mutations occur in the protein-coding regions of DNA called the exome. Our test is a whole exome sequencing test rather than a genotyping array, which allows us to cover all of the genes in a person’s DNA. We often get the question, why not do whole genome rather than whole exome? Right now it simply comes down to accessibility. For most consumers, whole genome sequencing is still too expensive and the additional gain in terms of coverage of pathogenic mutations doesn’t necessarily warrant the significant price increase. That being said, if you are interested in clinical-grade whole genome sequencing, we can soon offer this as well.<p>Patient privacy is a huge concern for us and something we think about all the time. Quite simply, we will never share any of our users&#x27; data without explicit consent and we are more than happy to both delete our users&#x27; data and destroy their sample if requested.<p>Interestingly, we often have the opposite problem where we receive inbound requests of people trying to share their data with us to see if we can help them. Out of the more than 10,000 rare diseases, over 95% do not have an FDA-approved treatment, which is why the rare disease community is so motivated to leverage their personal insights. We have started a waitlist to provide such services and are actively seeking ways to help these people and integrate them into our community, even if they have not had sequencing through us.<p>Finally, how much does it cost? A single test right now costs $899 on our website, but we try to offer the test in trios where we sequence both the patient and two family members as this often gives a higher diagnostic yield. The latter option is $1,799. We expect that the test price will decrease significantly with time as the cost of sequencing drops and more of the analysis can be automated. We don’t currently accept insurance; however, in our experience, using more traditional channels to access this kind of testing can result in bills of &gt;$10,000, not all of which may be covered. Many insurance providers don’t even cover this kind of testing, except for very specific purposes, despite more and more of the medical literature recommending exome sequencing as a first-tier diagnostic for specific indications. Ideally, we would make the product so affordable that it simply makes sense to use us rather than billing insurance for the test plus the numerous doctor and specialist visits needed before and after it’s ordered. We are currently offering the test at cost, as we aim not to profit off of the patients that need it most, and this is sustainable because, with the consent of the patients, we can leverage our data asset for drug discovery, clinical trial recruitment, and drug repurposing.<p>Consumer genetic testing is growing rapidly as an industry and nearly doubling every single year. What is missing from this market is accessible physician-ordered testing that can genuinely help those with complex symptoms and undiagnosed genetic conditions. This is what we hope to provide.

For example, if a user searches for &#x27;python jobs NY&#x27;, results from Indeed.com will be pulled in. The long term plan is to connect into the best vertical information sources for each type of query.<p>Quick Directs - Automatic redirects for a limited number of commonly searched terms (facebook, google, etc.).  This is similar to the Google &quot;Feeling Lucky&quot; button, but done by default. I found that most of the searches I did in Google were navigational. It&#x27;s simple, but surprisingly has been the thing to resonate with normal (non-technical) users.<p>Strict Search - Optional selection to force all the search terms in the query to be present in the web results.<p>Full URL paths - The full URL path of the result is available on the SERP under a toggle.<p>Privacy - The site doesn&#x27;t do any tracking. There will most likely be a need to put some things in place at some point to prevent abuse, but user search data will never be used for ad tracking.<p>The number of things I still have to add to the site is incredibly long, but I have gotten to the point where I have switched over to using it full time as my default search engine.","time":1582723085,"title":"Show HN: Runnaroo – A new web search engine","type":"story"},{"by":"omgbobbyg","descendants":181,"id":22422570,"kids":[22422770,22424377,22422883,22423675,22422766,22422761,22423511,22422968,22425357,22423186,22422982,22423490,22422897,22423501,22424042,22423163,22423054,22428600,22427258,22422683,22425117,22425550,22424949,22423185,22423436,22423341,22425228,22426898,22423479,22425064,22422737,22422815,22422754,22424245,22423080,22424746,22424216,22427342,22427720,22423003,22424351,22423716,22425863,22426044,22423438,22423418,22423158],"score":210,"time":1582722755,"title":"Don’t Confuse a Bug’s Priority with Its Severity","type":"story","url":"https://www.bluelabellabs.com/blog/dont-confuse-a-bugs-priority-with-its-severity/"},{"by":"api","descendants":190,"id":22422989,"kids":[22424201,22427082,22423559,22424478,22424346,22423510,22427968,22424244,22424614,22430444,22423650,22424010,22423217,22426428,22426149,22423998,22426651,22423213,22424291,22425991,22433970,22430267,22429286,22423428,22423401,22427783,22424171,22428186,22424411,22423383,22432648,22432182,22423441,22423837,22423231],"score":347,"time":1582725988,"title":"NeutralinoJS: Lightweight Electron alternative using native browser controls","type":"story","url":"https://neutralino.js.org"},{"by":"joshlittle","descendants":277,"id":22422522,"kids":[22425308,22422757,22422831,22423095,22422785,22422748,22422732,22422724,22425313,22424033,22423125,22422909,22423760,22422842,22423415,22424198,22424138,22423745,22432471,22422715,22423854,22428002,22422805,22423859,22423117,22430395,22425319,22424435,22423818,22426760,22425148,22425494,22424747,22443617,22432395,22429372,22423843,22422908],"score":309,"time":1582722350,"title":"Google Chrome's fear of Microsoft Edge is revealing its bad side","type":"story","url":"https://www.laptopmag.com/news/googles-fear-of-microsoft-edge-is-revealing-its-bad-side"},{"by":"ngaut","descendants":11,"id":22422501,"kids":[22432601,22432657,22432972,22435387,22439523,22432629,22433918],"score":78,"time":1582722213,"title":"Morel: A Functional Language for Data","type":"story","url":"http://blog.hydromatic.net/2020/02/25/morel-a-functional-language-for-data.html"},{"by":"psnosignaluk","descendants":7,"id":22422487,"kids":[22424816,22423836,22424381,22430107,22423790],"score":7,"text":"Good day HN<p>I&#x27;m on the lookout for static analysis tooling to apply to our toolchain, preferably at code review time.

It isn&#x27;t really a morning person thing<p>So obviously the main concern here is he never addressed my concern about why I, an engineer who mainly works by himself, on his own projects, which can be done at my house, needs to be in the office exactly at 8.  \nAnd more so, I’m a little up in arms that him being a my boss, would totally disregard any concern of mine and glance over it like I never brought it up.<p>He is very much the “my way or the highway” type and therefore I didn’t question his motives any more as I still don’t know how far I can push him before him getting completely fed up and firing me.<p>So I’m wondering, what are your guys thoughts on this situation and behavior ? And secondly, I can I handle this in a smooth way as to not cause serious issues or implications?","time":1582569736,"title":"Ask HN: How do I deal with this confrontation with my CTO","type":"story"},{"by":"vulkd","descendants":2,"id":22406708,"kids":[22428808,22406771],"score":6,"time":1582568513,"title":"Vue.js Documentary","type":"story","url":"https://youtu.be/OrxmtDw4pVI"},{"by":"StuntPope","descendants":64,"id":22406698,"kids":[22407861,22408094,22407983,22408228,22409170,22408595,22409191,22410519,22408655,22413237,22409585,22408817,22407780,22408839],"score":89,"time":1582568473,"title":"Twitter's community verification system will be a disaster","type":"story","url":"https://easydns.com/blog/2020/02/24/bias-and-b-s-would-be-baked-into-twitters-proposed-community-verification-system/"},{"by":"ingve","descendants":126,"id":22406667,"kids":[22407745,22407301,22407409,22407515,22409333,22407645,22409435,22407148,22407113,22407242,22407364,22407325,22407475,22408546,22409499,22407285,22407340,22413287,22407483,22408011,22407583,22407853,22426838,22413025,22407605,22415116,22407347,22407412,22413079,22407653,22407150,22407620,22407140,22408797,22407719,22407599,22409526,22407457,22408101],"score":213,"time":1582568342,"title":"Math is an insurance policy","type":"story","url":"https://bartoszmilewski.com/2020/02/24/math-is-your-insurance-policy/"},{"by":"dvt","descendants":368,"id":22406583,"kids":[22407206,22410977,22408809,22407241,22407346,22408960,22408502,22407198,22407149,22407988,22407525,22407130,22411703,22408320,22408193,22414085,22410807,22407463,22408668,22410895,22407684,22408375,22410604,22407901,22416772,22411003,22408590,22409841,22407518,22409116,22407681,22419638,22411763,22415945,22407562,22411637,22406787,22408737,22408431,22410490,22409012,22408373,22409137,22408931,22411604,22410969,22407652,22407651],"score":220,"time":1582567844,"title":"RFC: Let's Disrupt Dating Apps","type":"story","url":"https://dvt.name/2020/02/24/rfc-lets-disrupt-dating-apps/"},{"by":"stevepike","descendants":34,"id":22406560,"kids":[22407115,22406933,22411882,22407390,22408322,22413454,22407695,22406770,22415510,22407738,22439981,22407091,22407062,22407051,22408244,22407557,22407666],"score":124,"text":"Hi HN,<p>We&#x27;re Allison and Steve of Syndetic (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getsyndetic.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getsyndetic.com</a>). Syndetic is a web app that data providers use to explain their datasets to their customers. Think ReadMe but for datasets instead of APIs.<p>Every exchange of data ultimately comes down to a person at one company explaining their data to a person at another. Data buyers need to understand what&#x27;s in the dataset (what are the fields and what do they mean) as well as how valuable it can be to them (how complete is it? how relevant?). Data providers solve this problem today with a &quot;data dictionary&quot; which is a meta spreadsheet explaining a dataset. This gets shared alongside some sample data over email. These artifacts are constantly getting stale as the underlying data changes.<p>Syndetic replaces this with software connected directly to the data that&#x27;s being exchanged. We scan the data and automatically summarize it through statistics (e.g., cardinality), coverage rates, frequency counts, and sample sets. We do this continuously to monitor data quality over time. If a field gets removed from the file or goes from 1% null to 20% null we automatically alert the provider so they can take a look. For an example of what we produce but on an open dataset check out the results of the NYC 2015 Tree census at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getsyndetic.com&#x2F;publish&#x2F;datasets&#x2F;f1691c5d-56a9-47d4-8df7-a373a2894c8b\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getsyndetic.com&#x2F;publish&#x2F;datasets&#x2F;f1691c5d-56a9-4...</a>.<p>We met at SevenFifty, a tech startup connecting the three tiers of the beverage alcohol trade in the United States. SevenFifty integrates with the backend systems of 1,000+ beverage wholesalers to produce a complete dataset of what a restaurant can buy wholesale, at what price, in any zipcode in America. While the core business is a marketplace between buyers and sellers of alcohol, we built a side product providing data feeds back to beverage wholesalers about their own data. Syndetic grew out of the problems we experienced doing that. Allison kept a spreadsheet in dropbox of our data schema, which was very difficult to maintain, especially across a distributed team of data engineers and account managers. We pulled sample sets ad hoc, and ran stats over the samples to make sure the quality was good. We spent hours on the phone with our customers putting it all together to convey the meaning and the value of our data. We wondered why there was no software out there specifically built for data-as-a-service.<p>We also have backgrounds in quantitative finance (D. E. Shaw, Tower Research, BlackRock), large purchasers of external data, where we&#x27;ve seen the other side of this problem. Data purchasers spend a lot of time up-front evaluating the quality of a dataset, but they often don’t monitor how the quality changes over time. They also have a hard time assessing the intersection of external datasets with data they already have. We&#x27;re focusing on data providers first but expect to expand to purchasers down the road.<p>Our tech stack is one monolithic repo split into the frontend web app and backend data scanning. The frontend is a rails app and the data scanning is written in rust (we forked the amazing library xsv). One quirk is that we want to run the scanning in the same region as our customers&#x27; data to keep bandwidth costs and transfer time down, so we&#x27;re actually running across both GCP and AWS.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in this field you might enjoy reading the paper &quot;Datasheets for datasets&quot; (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1803.09010.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1803.09010.pdf</a>) which proposes a standardized method for documenting datasets modeled after the spec sheets that come with electronics. The authors propose that “for dataset creators, the primary objective is to encourage careful reflection on the process of creating, distributing, and maintaining a dataset, including any underlying assumptions, potential risks or harms, and implications of use.” We agree with them that as more and more data is sold, the chance of misunderstanding what’s in the data increases. We think we can help here by building qualitative questions into Syndetic alongside automation.<p>We have lots of ideas of where we could go with this, like fancier type detection (e.g. is this a phone number), validations, visualizations, anomaly detection, stability scores, configurable sampling, and benchmarking.

I took a look at some of the interviewing problems and was unable to complete even easy ones. Even when I can it&#x27;s likely very sub-optimal.<p>As a quick background, I am self taught, stumbled into this stuff was I was young. Never really learned anything well, but fell in love quickly. Never went to school (partly after reading many blogs about how it&#x27;s useless anyway). I&#x27;ve been employed for a few years, although no where near the comp levels discussed on the internet. My job consists mostly of what what one would consider CRUD: writing code that take data from one place, process it a bit, and store it somewhere else. I hate it, It feels tedious and unchallenging. Somehow, despite not much most days, I come home overly exhausted.<p>Since being employed, I haven&#x27;t learned much new. I only really know one or two languages now, being the ones I work with. I&#x27;ve tried many times, to learn new things. I&#x27;ve tried learning new languages, paradigms, domains (like kernel, graphics, etc. programming) but I&#x27;m incapable of learning. Every time I try it ends the same way: I end up staring at a screen for an hour or so reading docs or articles I&#x27;ll forget 10 min later or writing some skeleton code I&#x27;ll delete or never touch again. After that, I realize I&#x27;m not learning anything and giving up to go play games or watch TV.<p>It&#x27;s distressing, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever be able to get a role that I&#x27;d find interesting or challenging. Truthfully, I&#x27;m likely just not smart enough. Which is fine, not everyone can be, but I don&#x27;t want to do that same mind-numbing work I do now. My question is where do I go from here. I&#x27;ve considered to moving to a something like networking or sysadmin, but without any education it seems like I&#x27;d be at a severe disadvantage?

ago I started a relatively successful open source project (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;autospotting.org) designed to save its users a lot of money on AWS bills while being lightweight, easy to use and adopt.<p>I had a full-time job and I worked on it countless nights and weekends, developing it entirely in the open and not asking for anything in return. Hundreds of users started to use it and a few even contributed significant amount of code and it matured to eventually become production-grade.<p>A couple of years later my child was born and I had a hard time justifying spending time on it instead of spending it with my wife and son. I thought about it a lot and eventually decided to monetise it on Patreon and treat it as a mini-job. I&#x27;d be spending on it roughly as much time as I get from it on a monthly basis, considering my usual hourly rate, hoping to one day ramp it up enough to actually become a full-time job (currently at $450&#x2F;month, so still quite far from this goal).<p>In order to give some additional value to to my patrons, I decided to start testing selected builds that I only announce as stable releases in private to my patrons.<p>So I keep developing it in the open, I just don&#x27;t create public releases of the open source code.<p>I&#x27;ve recently seen someone say this about my project:<p>&quot;For somebody who works in OSS software, incl. commercial OSS, it is painful to see such an blatant, unethical approach to monetisation https:&#x2F;&#x2F;autospotting.org<p>&#x27;Our code is really shit, but if you give us money, we&#x27;ll give you a less shit version&#x27;<p>This is not the spirit of OSS&quot;<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;matthewfellows&#x2F;status&#x2F;1197013237222391808<p>So what do you folks think about this?","time":1582408412,"title":"Ask HN: Do you find it unethical to monetize open source like this?","type":"story"},{"by":"zizee","descendants":2,"id":22393492,"kids":[22393582,22396536],"score":5,"time":1582407375,"title":"Show HN: Jargonaut - Project glossaries for your dev team","type":"story","url":"https://app.jargonaut.net/"},{"by":"arm","descendants":5,"id":22393362,"kids":[22394729,22394569,22394393],"score":34,"time":1582406075,"title":"Brace yourself, I’m in an expansive mood (2019)","type":"story","url":"https://leancrew.com/all-this/2019/09/brace-yourself-im-in-an-expansive-mood/"},{"by":"gajus","descendants":5,"id":22393286,"kids":[22393295,22457764,22399193,22393877],"score":12,"time":1582405172,"title":"Show HN: GitSpo – Monitoring and Analytics for Open-Source Projects","type":"story","url":"http://gitspo.com/"},{"by":"georgecmu","descendants":4,"id":22393260,"kids":[22394991,22396860,22398575,22396513],"score":88,"time":1582404877,"title":"Pycel: Compiling Excel spreadsheets to Python and making pretty pictures (2011)","type":"story","url":"https://dirkgorissen.com/2011/10/19/pycel-compiling-excel-spreadsheets-to-python-and-making-pretty-pictures/"},{"by":"rrishi","descendants":5,"id":22393251,"kids":[22393558,22399916,22393485,22393513],"score":4,"text":"I am more of a pen&#x2F;paper person than computer.

My friend who also has some servers with OVH mentioned to me yesterday that he saw a lot of strange IP addresses mainly in East Asia attempting to SSH into his server when he looked at the file &#x2F;var&#x2F;log&#x2F;auth.log . Out of curiosity I checked this file on my 3 servers and on all 3 servers the log was full of similar mysterious IP addresses from East Asia trying to login with invalid usernames. I was confused as to why seemingly every server on OVH&#x27;s network receives so much traffic from these hosts. It got me curious, what are all these hosts and why are they attempting to gain access to OVH servers? I contacted OVH support and they said they were already aware that some other entity was attacking their servers like this. After seeing these strange connections I stopped listening for SSH on port 22 and changed it to a non standard port, and I have quite the long SSH password anyway so I&#x27;m not too worried about becoming a victim of one of these attacks, but it does make me wonder. Are they just trying to gain control of some poorly secured OVH server so that they can have control of a server for their nefarious purposes?

HN!<p>We’re Fitz &amp; Malis, the founders of Freshpaint (YC S19) (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freshpaint.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freshpaint.io&#x2F;</a>). Our product is a more flexible way of setting up your analytics and marketing tools.<p>With our javascript snippet, Freshpaint automatically instruments your site by tracking every behavior for you, up front. From there, you can create events for behaviors like clicks, pageviews, etc either through a point-and-click interface or code (whichever you’re more comfortable with). In one click, Freshpaint sends data collected for that event – past or present – to 80+ analytics or marketing tools.<p>What does retroactive mean? Install Freshpaint’s snippet today. In 6 months start tracking something new, and you&#x27;ll have the last 6 months worth of data that our product has already collected. We make it easy to backfill that historical data into your tools.<p>There’s two types of people that get the most value out of Freshpaint:<p>1. The developer that owns data infrastructure at their company, and wants to lighten the load through automation.<p>2. The non-technical marketer&#x2F;customer success&#x2F;PM (or founder!) that makes use of the tools that require customer data.<p>We both met while working at Heap (YC W13) – Malis led the database team and Fitz led product marketing. When starting Freshpaint, we were inspired by a phenomenon we saw while working with customers at Heap. Even though they used Heap for analytics, we kept seeing companies also writing tracking code for each behavior they wanted to use in other tools, either with a routing service like Segment and mParticle or building direct implementations and their own pipelines. Across analytics, product, and marketing it was common to see a dozen tools that required the same data including tools like Hubspot, Intercom, Fullstory, advertising platforms, data warehouses, and more.<p>Let’s say you want to see how many users clicked your signup button or played a song in your analytics tools. Or you want to take the users who added an item to their cart and engage them in an automated marketing campaign. First, you have to write code to collect and log each behavior that you want to track. Then you have to send it to your marketing and analytics tools.<p>This requires a massive engineering effort and it’s distracting to maintain (it’s not uncommon to delay shipping a new feature by 2-3 weeks because of this tax). If you didn’t track something or made a mistake, that data is lost forever.<p>Developers have to do a bunch of work that (1) is not core product development, and (2) they often aren’t the ones to get value from that work because they’re not the end users of this data. Flip this problem around and you have marketers and PMs that are slowed or blocked from their work, and have to distract developers to get unblocked.<p>This is painful for multiple teams. Fitz experienced this a few years back as part of the growth team at Quantcast, and he always had to work with engineering to instrument what he needed to trigger marketing flows and or get analytics telemetry on his experiments.<p>We built Freshpaint to lighten the load and streamline the workflow for both groups. How it works:<p>1. Install Freshpaint’s javascript snippet on your site. It takes 60 seconds, and from that point Freshpaint collects every behavior like clicks, pageviews, etc.<p>2. Connect destinations like Google Analytics, Amplitude, Hubspot, Fullstory, Intercom, and a data warehouse. This is done by copying and pasting an API key or account ID. Complete integrations list here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freshpaint.io&#x2F;integrations\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freshpaint.io&#x2F;integrations</a>. We plan to build more so let us know what you’d like to see.<p>3. Create events for clicks, pageviews, form submissions, and more from data in Freshpaint. Create events thru code or point-and-click in our UI. Data is retroactively available back to the day you installed Freshpaint, regardless of when the event is created. We also support manual tracking and server-side tracking.<p>4. Send data to the destinations we support in one click. You can even backfill past data that Freshpaint has collected.<p>We&#x27;re eager to hear your feedback, since we know HN has a ton of members who are familiar with this space from all different perspectives!","time":1582304792,"title":"Launch HN: Freshpaint (YC S19) – an automated, retroactive Segment alternative","type":"story"},{"by":"riwasabi","descendants":8,"id":22384771,"kids":[22385066,22388026,22385785,22385404],"score":6,"text":"Many people say Ruby on Rails is the preferred choice for startups because it helps you move faster.

Everybody has their favourite products, and each of those products (awesome as they may be) have a couple of small things that could be improved to make them even better.<p>What&#x27;s interesting, though, due to a variety of reasons we usually don&#x27;t report those things at all - we might not think the complaint is solicited, we might not think that anything will be fixed after we report the thing, or even just writing and sending a semi-formal letter is too much friction for such a simple task.<p>This is why we&#x27;ve built Gripeless, an all-in-1 solution to make the process as smooth as possible for the user so that they don&#x27;t have to write emails, don&#x27;t have to think whether the product-owner is acting on those complaints or even requesting complaints in the first place.<p>Gripeless can be installed onto any website and the provided script is only 20kB gzipped. Both the script and the management dashboard are built with Elm, which turned out to be an amazing choice for making things fast.<p>We&#x27;re specifically building a product that can capture complaints and efficient access to them, so Gripeless is not a replacement for:<p>- Email support software - like Zendesk or Supportbee<p>- Automated analytics - like Google Analytics or Mixpanel<p>- Error reporting software - like Sentry or Rollbar<p>Complaints, that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re all about.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of existing science behind complaints in the service industry which this

have been working on a big project for quite some time now and I am finding myself rewriting and optimizing&#x2F;duplicating the code quite often and not finishing the damn thing as a whole(this is

And I am getting really tired of writing the same stuff over and over again. I work with Go which does not have generics but I would not say that is the issue here(I actually do not miss generics, maybe once or twice a year tbh).<p>In essence, over the years, I grew tired of writing so much code. It&#x27;s not that I do no like writing code, it&#x27;s just that I clearly see how much code I need to write in order to implement the business logic. And I&#x27;m just tired of it.<p>So I want to create a code generator that would take my business logic and generate the full implementation out of it so I can truly focus only on that and not the code itself. I have wrote code generators before, usually for event-sourcing stuff and repositories(db), so this is nothing new. But I am after more abstraction, less time spent writing code, more time spend developing the application as a whole. Imagine something like terraform but not for infrastructure but for the code.<p>So before I attempt to write something on this scale I was wondering if maybe there already is something out there?","time":1582220183,"title":"Ask HN: Is there codegen framework for business logic?","type":"story"},{"by":"drchiu","descendants":282,"id":22376794,"kids":[22377356,22378166,22377551,22378342,22377211,22378765,22377595,22377901,22378005,22377605,22381498,22377272,22377708,22379011,22382178,22379306,22380602,22377180,22382471,22380063,22377424,22380597,22378626],"score":477,"time":1582220097,"title":"DigitalOcean raises $100M in debt as it scales toward revenue of $300M","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/digitalocean-raises-100m-in-debt-as-it-scales-towards-revenue-of-300m-profitability/"},{"by":"james_impliu","descendants":83,"id":22376732,"kids":[22378393,22379019,22377247,22378668,22377175,22377453,22379267,22376943,22378245,22377355,22381339,22377897,22377571,22381013,22378997,22379373,22377834,22377037,22380245,22377650,22379724,22377303,22379248,22377114,22377101,22376956,22378955,22381184,22384470,22377179,22382165,22377057,22377142],"score":282,"text":"James, Tim and Aaron here - we are building a self-hosted, open source Mixpanel&#x2F;Amplitude style product.

We didn’t manage to solve that problem, but we learned how important product analytics were in finding users, getting them to try it out, and in understanding which features we needed to focus on to impact users.<p>However, when we installed product analytics, it bothered us how we needed to send our users’ data to 3rd parties. Exporting data from these tools costs $manyK a month, and it felt wrong from a privacy perspective. We designed PostHog to solve these problems.<p>We made PostHog to automatically capture every front-end click, removing the need to add track(‘event’) - it has a toolbar to label important events after they’re captured. That means you’re spending less time fixing your tracking. You can also push events too.<p>You can have API&#x2F;SQL access to the underlying data, and it has analytics - funnels and event trends with segmentation based on event properties (like UTM tags). That means we’ve got the best parts of the 3rd party analytics providers but are more privacy and developer friendly.<p>We’re thinking of adding features around paths&#x2F;retention&#x2F;pushing events to other tools (ie slack&#x2F;your CRM). We’d love to hear your feature requests.<p>We are platform and language agnostic, with a very simple setup. If you want Python&#x2F;Ruby&#x2F;Node, we give you a library. For anything else, there’s an API. The repo has instructions for Heroku (1 click!), Docker or deploy from source.<p>We’ve launched this repo under MIT license so any developer can use the tool. The goal is to not charge individual developers. We make money by charging a license fee for things like multiple users, user permissions, integrations with other databases, providing a hosted version and support.<p>Give it a spin: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;posthog&#x2F;posthog\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;posthog&#x2F;posthog</a>.

I just want to get as much direction and focus into my learning as I can since my free time is pretty limited at the moment and I would appreciate some advice.","time":1582216073,"title":"Ask HN: How can I get a remote position?","type":"story"},{"by":"samclemens","descendants":47,"id":22376039,"kids":[22380037,22380167,22380759,22382625,22390853,22380165],"score":53,"time":1582214930,"title":"Slavery in Early Austin: The Stringer’s Hotel and Urban Slavery","type":"story","url":"https://notevenpast.org/slavery-in-early-austin-the-stringers-hotel-and-urban-slavery/"},{"by":"nsdfg","descendants":81,"id":22376028,"kids":[22376195,22376507,22376417,22376304,22376750,22379773,22376730,22376228,22378072,22376340,22376483],"score":185,"time":1582214871,"title":"Google plans to move UK users' accounts outside EU jurisdiction","type":"story","url":"https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN20E08W"},{"by":"adamnemecek","descendants":48,"id":22375979,"kids":[22380383,22380648,22381043,22380950,22377390,22381394,22381084,22380744,22380940],"score":198,"time":1582214536,"title":"Sled: Embedded Database Written in Rust","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/spacejam/sled"},{"by":"doener","descendants":3,"id":22375978,"kids":[22379895,22376584,22376901],"score":17,"time":1582214535,"title":"Coronavirus brings China's surveillance state out of the shadows","type":"story","url":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-surveillance-idUSKBN2011HO"},{"by":"bryk","descendants":13,"id":22375965,"kids":[22377006,22378255,22379437,22388334,22388460,22375975,22376308,22375980,22381466,22380596,22377518,22375985],"score":18,"time":1582214453,"title":"Ask HN: HNers, where do you hang out online in your spare time?","type":"story"},{"by":"laurex","descendants":89,"id":22375846,"kids":[22378065,22376254,22376311,22376633,22376932,22377733,22377941,22376525,22376762,22376091,22377702],"score":166,"time":1582213633,"title":"What Coronavirus Does to the Body","type":"story","url":"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/02/here-is-what-coronavirus-does-to-the-body/"},{"by":"theafh","descendants":13,"id":22375796,"kids":[22393758,22395232,22393488,22395394,22397224],"score":58,"time":1582213309,"title":"‘Radical change’ needed after latest neutron star collision","type":"story","url":"https://www.quantamagazine.org/radical-change-needed-after-latest-neutron-star-collision-20200220/"},{"by":"malshe","descendants":268,"id":22375774,"kids":[22379219,22377092,22376870,22376207,22377600,22376363,22376404,22377837,22376708,22379682,22376720,22376326,22377669,22379418,22377771,22378924,22377054,22467717,22379225,22379889,22377112,22377921,22378507,22378821,22376394,22376367,22377594,22380963,22376503,22376774,22377086,22377341,22377268,22379059,22377870,22377769,22376938,22380219,22377814,22378436,22380793,22379214,22376409,22376997,22379767,22380864,22375860],"score":420,"time":1582213126,"title":"A group of ex-NSA and Amazon engineers are building a ‘GitHub for data’","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/gretel-nsa-amazon-github-data/"},{"by":"Dowwie","descendants":2,"id":22375787,"kids":[22380319,22383716],"score":9,"time":1582213201,"title":"Confronting Indifference Toward Truth – Dealing with Workplace Bullshit","type":"story","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000768132030001X#"},{"by":"rayshan","descendants":6,"id":22375759,"kids":[22376238,22376069,22376043,22378960],"score":12,"time":1582212985,"title":"Show HN: A better unicorn IPO leaderboard","type":"story","url":"https://blog.ltse.com/a-better-unicorn-ipo-leaderboard-8e5c2903c9b"},{"by":"smacktoward","descendants":2,"id":22375693,"kids":[22376476,22376174],"score":6,"time":1582212502,"title":"25 Years Later, 'Star Wars: Dark Forces' Is a Forgotten Gem","type":"story","url":"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qjdz5v/star-wars-dark-forces-25-years-later"},{"by":"Tomte","descendants":50,"id":22375636,"kids":[22376121,22375955,22375773,22376057,22376129,22375883,22376005,22376229,22375902,22375809,22376242,22376026,22376142,22376259,22375951,22376141,22376299,22376287,22376501,22376220,22375941,22376035,22376071,22376619,22376232,22375771,22377111],"score":37,"time":1582212018,"title":"X-Force Command Cyber Tactical Operations Center","type":"story","url":"https://www.ibm.com/security/services/managed-security-services/xforce-command-cyber-tactical-operations-center"},{"by":"czatt","descendants":4,"id":22375594,"kids":[22379861,22375680,22379445],"score":4,"text":"I have recently started receiving a lot of &quot;please confirm your subscription by clicking the link below&quot; emails for things I have not signed up for. 20-30 per hour, which is too much for it to be someone just trying to annoy me.

I&#x27;ve run it by a few people that are exceedingly cynical and the response was somewhat shocking (they both loved it). Having many years in this industry I understand that a good, new and original idea is pretty rare so I&#x27;ve naturally gotten pretty excited to develop this thing. However laying in bed last night with this all buzzing around I realized I don&#x27;t know how to go about it in 2020. I did a number of startups in the early 2000&#x27;s (non &#x27;made it&#x27;) and back then your options were basically to bootstrap it yourself or try an incubator.<p>My question is this - in 2020 what&#x27;s the best, most viable way to develop and bring to market a good&#x2F;serious idea that you want to make a serious run at?  It used to be you&#x27;d build a prototype or even the full website&#x2F;app, etc and along with a pitch-deck you&#x27;d try to raise money or give an incubator a shot.<p>A bit more about the idea... it&#x27;s big enough where I think it would need the backing of something like ycombinator, techcrunch or techstars to really reach it&#x27;s potential. Reason being, it would compete in an existing space where there are already huge, well funded players (I know this is typically the way things are). To put it into better perspective, it would be something on the level of a linked-in, indeed or maybe tinder, bumble are better examples. To be clear I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s either of those niches, just saying it would be similar to those and I&#x27;d be dealing with breaking into that kind of established space.<p>Just wondering what the best approach is for &#x27;going for it&#x27; in 2020 for your dream-shot, retire and buy an island idea.<p>Thanks!","time":1582211504,"title":"Ask HN: How to Do a Startup in 2020?","type":"story"},{"by":"pmarin","descendants":23,"id":22375449,"kids":[22380966,22381436,22382233,22382806,22380835,22378457,22375459],"score":52,"time":1582210620,"title":"Demonstration of the Xerox PARC Cedar integrated environment (2019) [video]","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_dt7NG38V4"},{"by":"doppp","descendants":4,"id":22375434,"kids":[22375930,22376211,22375832],"score":10,"time":1582210437,"title":"Indonesian minister calls on rich to marry poor to cut country's poverty rate","type":"story","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/indonesia-rich-should-marry-poor-reduce-poverty-minister-12453842"},{"by":"angrygoat","descendants":45,"id":22375331,"kids":[22376687,22379020,22376003,22376306,22375969,22378730,22378700,22379056,22383002,22377606,22376184,22380187],"score":102,"time":1582209400,"title":"The Law of Conservation of Complexity","type":"story","url":"http://nomodes.com/Larry_Tesler_Consulting/Complexity_Law.html"},{"by":"d4n","descendants":11,"id":22375327,"kids":[22379137,22375393,22375923,22376408,22392122,22389231],"score":12,"text":"I have worked at multiple consulting service companies that offered engineers commission for bringing in new business.

This is for several reasons:<p>1. Redis eliminates the cognitive overhead of learning another database language or data structures. What you know in your programming language can be more or less replicated in Redis. For anyone who does not come from a database&#x2F;SQL background this is huge.

Forget about benchmarks and all that.<p>3. Resilience - Redis got a lot of flak for the AOF bugs that are mostly sorted out now. You have Sentinel, replication and what not. At least DR is not a concern anymore.<p>4. Plethora of clients - this was never a concern but, the client support has vastly improved in the past couple of years.

Goodcover provides renters insurance (only in California at the moment) and operates as a cooperative. We take a fixed fee on every policy, pool the premiums to pay claims, and then return what’s left over back to Members through an annual dividend. Thanks to this model and good technology we’re able to cut the price of renters insurance in half.<p>I (Chris) worked in traditional insurance for 8 years. That time taught me to love insurance and how it picks people up after disasters, but it also gave me first hand exposure to the things people hate about it – the ever-increasing prices, the adversarial claims negotiations, the mountains of paperwork, and the byzantine decision making. All these inefficiencies kept us from really understanding and working for our policyholders – the people we were meant to serve. I became convinced technology was coming for this industry.<p>I moved to SF in 2016, which is where I met Dan through a family friend. Dan had co-founded Cloudkick (YCW09) and was now looking to start another company. He also knew technology was coming for insurance, especially after his early career at IBM where he saw just how many “tech consultants” were placed in State Farm. Meeting him was a breath of fresh air – we started Goodcover in 2017 and got into YC right after.<p>And then… it took us two years to get a product to market. We had opportunities to get going faster – you can get an agent’s license, buy off the shelf software, and sell other companies’ products in a matter of weeks. But they would be the same crappy, overpriced, adversarial products that everybody sells, and everybody hates. What good is that? Instead, we didn’t take the shortcuts and stuck it out to change the business model to cut the price in half, and Goodcover is the result.<p>The story of how we did this starts with how insurance prices are made. If you have lots of claims data, you can run regressions to learn how underwriting factors like location, customer data, previous losses, etc all affect the frequency and severity of claims for every dollar of coverage you are providing. You then load that claims model with your expenses and desired profit margin, and boom you have insurance rates. You then have to get the Department of Insurance in each state you enter to sign off on your rates (not too low so you lose money, not so high that the government calls out your gouging).<p>We knew technology would save us a lot on processing costs – with Dan’s technical background we knew that we could build technology that would run the business for a fraction of the cost that the typical industry vendors charge. We weren’t going to be saddled with huge agency forces or massive brand advertising. But, we didn’t have any claims data.<p>Enter Quirk 1 of the insurance industry: all personal lines insurance pricing is public. Since all product and pricing is approved by the state government, to start something new you need to essentially reconstitute work other companies have done, proving that the elements you choose work for your target market. This is why most new insurance offerings are basically just another version of the pricing model sold by the “Insurance Services Office” (ISO – yes, that’s a company, not a government agency). It’s approved everywhere and used by everyone, so it’s a quick start. Lemonade uses ISO with one important modification: they set their minimum premium at $60 instead of $120, allowing them to claim an introductory price of $5 a month. If you buy more than the minimum coverage though, you’ll quickly get to “everybody else’s price” territory.<p>However to cut the price without sacrificing coverage, we couldn’t use the same model that everyone else does. We needed a more granular model where we could charge the safest 99% people very little in exchange for charging the riskier 1% more. In my insurance career I had learned a lot about models designed for high-value homes, jewelry, cars etc – these models price in catastrophe (like hurricane and wildfire) very precisely to manage exposures in high-risk places. This granularity results in much lower prices for safer risks, since prices there don’t need to subsidize risky ones like they do in traditional “mass market” models. We decided to adapt these models to build our own that would be applicable to our target market, i.e. Renters. Our competitors that don’t use these models are in a bit of a pickle, because they can’t raise prices for high risks too fast thanks to regulatory constraints, meaning they have to keep prices high in safe places to balance the book.<p>It also meant we could start with a coverage baseline that was better than the usual Renters Policy, including coverage for mold remediation, water damage originating from other peoples’ apartments, etc. We modernized the coverage, getting rid of extra coverage for things like oriental rugs and replacing it with more computer coverage. And critically we lowered the expense base, allowing us to offer huge savings thanks to the compound effect of lower costs and more granular pricing for our target market. The biggest apples-to-apples discount we’ve clocked so far is 71%.<p>Custom model in hand, we were a critical step closer. But we still couldn’t offer insurance until we had the capital ready to pay claims. Insurance regulation sensibly makes sure that before you sell insurance to anyone you are adequately capitalized to pay your claims. Thus we set out to raise more capital.<p>Here’s where we ran into Quirk 2, and something I should have known all along. Insurance Claims Capital is inherently not venturable. VCs look for 10-100x return on investment. But, as we grew the company, by law our claims capital reserves would always need to be at least 3x our expected losses (8x is normal). That geometric growth pattern is not scalable. Even if we raised over and over again, by the time we “made it big” we would be selling shares to normal investors, people who value insurance companies on a multiple of their cash on hand. Today’s insurance monsters have grown their cash base slowly for about 100 years. We found it was inefficient for us to own this capital, and therefore impossible to pitch. Money we raise should go to scaling our operations, not sitting around in case we had more claims than premiums. This meant we need to get claims capital partners – aka, rent it from insurance companies.<p>We had hoped to avoid this because of quirk 3 of the insurance industry, “underwriting profits”. It used to be you could run an insurance business with huge expenses at a loss and make money because interest rates are great. No longer. The way insurance companies make money today is by keeping the difference of premium minus claims and expenses, or “underwriting profit”. This sets insurers up to be in conflict with their customers, and my experience in the industry showed me that if there was a root cause for all the reasons people hated insurance, this was it. So not only would we now need to ask insurers for help, we’d need them to give us their profit back to return to Members.<p>This process took over a year. Fortunately we secured in-principle approval from a great reinsurer (TransRe) early on. The next step was to find a “primary” insurance partner to get us set up in California. We still have the chart of our emotions on the whiteboard in our office from that time – with huge ups (like when we moved to board-level conversations with one of California’s best cooperative insurers) to huge lows (like when those talks collapsed because that insurer’s agency force wouldn’t allow the channel conflict of a digital partner). Eventually we got it done, inking a three-party deal that worked for everyone, providing a more or less stable return for our capital partners but with the excess profit returning to Goodcover’s Members. With model and insurance capital partners in hand we then moved to get approval from California, which went as well as a process like that could, thank goodness.<p>While we were working on these business objectives we built the necessary technology to service policies, quotes and maintain regulatory compliance. The easiest way to think of insurance is it works like an append only database. For instance, to remove coverage you would amend a person’s policy contract to remove a coverage, and so similarly in our tech stack we append an event that describes the changes to the policy which outputs a final policy. As a side benefit, this allows us to see the current state of a policy at any point in time. This model works well for us considering most, if not all, of our code is written in a functional language (Scala).<p>Which brings us up to late last year when we wrote our first Goodcover policy.

Kept following things in mind:<p>1.Use GIF in the thumbnail\n2.Product screenshots\n3.Post close to 12:00 am PST\n4.Never indulge in fake voting<p>We ended that day @ 4th position! Coming in top 5 on Product Hunt opens a lot of early PR opportunities. So, we go covered by number of niche blogs.<p>We spent $1k on SEO &amp; $200 in FB Ads targeting job profiles like Support Manager, HR Manager etc. To break some users (similar to us) from existing players, we built 1-click account migration for both Front and Help Scout from day 1. Also, we built few other integrations (Stripe, Twilio, Pipedrive etc.) to get some distribution going for us as early as possible.<p>We signed up 500+ users within 1st week. We priced the product the way we wanted it to be as a customer of other shared inbox offerings in the market. And, the pricing was also partly influenced by our love for Basecamp. So, we have 2 plans - free and $99&#x2F;m for unlimited users.<p>When you have a free plan, it is very important to design that free plan smartly. If you don&#x27;t put the controls on features at the right trigger point, you will miss out on the upgrades. Hence, we spent more time on planning our free plan than our paid plan. The idea really was to figure out the stage at which a small startup feels the pain of email chaos and is ready to pay for the solutuon. So, we offer the product for free for up to 5 team members. If you need anything more than that, pay $99&#x2F;m.<p>In 77 days, we have converted 52 accounts (4% of signups) into paid @ avg $120&#x2F;month.<p>Hope this is useful for some of you.","time":1582116188,"title":"How we reached $6250 monthly recurring revenue in 77 days from launch","type":"story"},{"by":"aogl","descendants":2,"id":22364949,"kids":[22365055,22365039],"score":5,"time":1582116305,"title":"What it takes to be a Platform Engineer in 2020","type":"story","url":"https://ao.gl/what-it-takes-to-be-a-platform-engineer-in-2020/"},{"by":"onetimemanytime","descendants":2,"id":22364873,"kids":[22364955,22365111],"score":2,"time":1582115116,"title":"Why do so many Egyptian statues have broken noses?

I would really like to know what all I can do to get better at designing such big complex systems. I try to read open source but it always feels like a challenge. I don&#x27;t know if I have the aptitude for this but studying CS and the thought processes of people who have spent so much effort in this field gives me a lot of joy. So, if you have any advice, resources, books or tutorials that you think might help me, please do share. I would be really obliged.

We make tools to help with using third-party APIs in production.<p>When software teams integrate with APIs they often run into outages, network issues, interface changes or even bugs that cause unexpected behavior in the rest of their system. These problems are hard to predict and prepare for so most teams don’t deal with them until there&#x27;s a outage and have to do an emergency build to add logging and get to a root cause.<p>This is what happened to us. Trung and I are both software engineers and we spent a lot of time and energy trying to make our API integrations robust and reliable in production. We found ourselves instrumenting all our API calls so we could know how many calls we were making, how long they were taking and if they were failing. We set up alerts for errors and latency increases and integrated with PagerDuty. We wrote retry logic with exponential backoff. We wrote failover from one API provider to another. At the end of it all we built a lot of tooling that required maintenance and wasn’t even applied uniformly across all of our integrations.<p>After building all this infrastructure we realized that many other teams are reinventing the same wheel.<p>To solve this problem we built an API proxy that takes requests and relays them to the API provider. By proxying this traffic we are able to instrument each call to measure latency, record status codes, headers and bodies, and add reliability features like automatic retry with exponential backoff. From there we can monitor and alert on issues and provide a searchable call log for debugging and auditability.<p>We knew that because we were asking teams to run their mission critical API calls through us that we had to build a highly available and scalable proxy architecture. We’ve done this by designing a proxy that can be distributed across multiple regions and clouds. We are currently running out of AWS. Global Accelerator allows us to use their private internet backbone to quickly get traffic to our proxies which run behind AWS Network Load Balancers. While this can help us ensure resilience against infrastructure outages, we also need to protect against self-inflicted wounds like bugs and bad deployments. Upon release we bring up a new set of proxy instances, deploy the code, and run our full test suite to make sure that each instance is able to proxy requests correctly. Once all instances are healthy they begin to go into the load balancer.<p>For companies with more stringent needs we support on-premise installations as well as a client-side SDK that can do instrumentation without the proxy.<p>Today we offer the service as a subscription. We hope to make it easy for teams to get visibility and control across all their integrations without having to build it themselves. This includes:<p>- Detailed logging on all of their third-party API calls<p>- Monitoring and alerting for increased latency and error rates<p>- Reliability features like automatic retry, circuit breaker and request queueing<p>- Rate limit and quota monitoring<p>We would love to hear from the community how you are managing your API integrations.

We&#x27;re Parthi and Kunal from FounderPhone (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;founderphone.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;founderphone.com</a>). FounderPhone is a shared customer support inbox for SMS and calls in Slack.<p>We&#x27;ve built and shipped 7 products recently and if there&#x27;s one thing we&#x27;ve learned, it&#x27;s that your personal relationship with your customer is your secret weapon as a startup. Having customers email support@company.com or message a bot via Intercom doesn&#x27;t feel personal. People are skeptical they will ever get a response. We&#x27;ve had a lot of success giving out our phone number to the top customers we really care about and telling them to text us whenever something comes up. Apparently, lots of great founders like Patrick from Stripe did this for their VIP customers while growing their startups.<p>The problem is that a single SMS inbox isn&#x27;t sustainable at scale. So we hacked together a solution for ourselves where we made Slack a shared inbox. When a customer texts or calls me, our team can also see the messages and incoming calls. We can discuss how best to handle the issue in Slack and then anyone can respond via text. For calls, anyone available can redirect calls to their own number. From the customer&#x27;s perspective, they&#x27;re just texting a single number. They&#x27;re not frustrated with messy tickets or being routed to 3 different people. They will always read your responses because it&#x27;s in their SMS inbox instead of being lost amongst their 20,000 unread emails.<p>This is just the start! We&#x27;re looking into building a whole suite of software to make customer support feel both personal and immediate. We&#x27;re making an integration with Segment and Sentry to alert you when a customer has an issue so you can reach out to them about it before they complain to you.<p>Text our FounderPhone (510) 756-2522 with your name or email founders@founderphone.com if you have any questions.

I&#x27;m hoping for enough responses for a statistically valid sample of the responding population. A previous version of this on another site got one poll response.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if there are zero responses to the question no matter what I ask, but I&#x27;ll try to ask a fair question that most accurately reflects the situation, without going into too much detail:<p>Suppose there was a way for a country to create a lot of jobs without additional government spending. Due to less need for welfare spending or things like the Works Progress Administration that created jobs in the US during the Great Depression, government spending could actually decrease.<p>However, if one country used the system, other countries would know of it as well, and if they used it, profits of companies selling luxury goods in the first country would decrease. The &#x27;cultural influence&#x27; of the first country could also decrease — if the first country was the US, perhaps fewer people would be interested in learning English.<p>The question is, what role do economic advisors have in this situation? In the US, this is the Council of Economic Advisors: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.whitehouse.gov&#x2F;cea&#x2F;<p>I will not quote it due to length. Other countries may have similar things. What best describes what advisors should do?<p>1) They SHOULD NOT do anything as a result of knowing about a system that does this.<p>2) They MAY or CAN share this system with the leader of their country.<p>3) They SHOULD share this system with the leader of their country.<p>4) They MUST share this system with the leader of their country.<p>I&#x27;d also ask, if economic advisors should not share this system, is there anyone who should?

When I click the submit button, I get an error simply telling me, &quot;Something went wrong, please contact support,&quot; which is what I was trying to do in the first place!<p>* Evaluating a well known language learning tool, and clicking on the first lesson. The page transitions briefly into the lesson page, then quickly snaps back to the list of lessons. This keeps happening, until I try disabling Firefox&#x27;s Enhanced Tracking Protection, which makes the workflow succeed. I realize this could be ETP being overzealous, but a broken site because Google Analytics, et al., aren&#x27;t being loaded seems like an oversight.<p>* Using a major DNS management vendor&#x27;s portal to update a record. I click &quot;Sign In&quot; on the homepage and since I have a session, the portal shows me my dashboard.

I&#x27;m a young engineer(25) with 3 years of industry experience. From the very first few days in this company, my manager gave me 100% independence to do something interesting. 2 years ago the company decided to transition into a brand new building, and that event has just happened. So, 2 years ago, I got this amazing opportunity to work on the digital version of this building, to make it as smart as possible. I am the designer and the implementer of the core component of this project, pretty much an operating system for the building, implemented in Haskell. I gave my heart and soul into this project, because I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll get this kind of opportunity ever again. Besides this, they sponsored every single conference I wanted to go to, I&#x27;ve had time for about 3 per year. They bought every book I needed and allowed me to work from home whenever I wanted, or come to work whenever I wanted. In less than a month, the project is about to be live, and will do a lot of stuff to help the employees be more productive at work. So this is what kept me going, and I&#x27;ve been extremely happy in my work. However:<p>1. Even though the pay is about the industry average, I&#x27;ve had to turn down a lot of offers this year(even 2x to 2.5x salaries) because in my head, developing a smart building and developing a website is simply laughable to compare.<p>2. I&#x27;m pretty much the only one in this company(about 600 in this location alone) that has this kind of freedom. I&#x27;m lying, a few people have joined the project throughout the years to help me out.<p>3. There&#x27;s no real ambition around me. Nobody wants to go beyond the accepted level of quality and deliver something amazing, a few details that would really delight the users. I really have to push to make these things happen.","time":1581975235,"title":"Ask HN: Can you help me with some career advice?","type":"story"},{"by":"parkeragee","descendants":8,"id":22351028,"kids":[22351917,22363523,22355245],"score":37,"time":1581975198,"title":"Show HN: Real-Time job opening notifications from remote-friendly companies","type":"story","url":"https://hireremotely.co"},{"by":"fanf2","descendants":22,"id":22350986,"kids":[22351675,22351489,22352204,22356470,22375667,22355562,22351852],"score":101,"time":1581974979,"title":"An emulator for a Sun 2 workstation","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/lisper/emulator-sun-2"},{"by":"got-any-grapes","descendants":3,"id":22350839,"kids":[22354977,22355069,22357882],"score":9,"time":1581974125,"title":"All your favorite brands, from BSTOEM to ZGGCD","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/style/amazon-trademark-copyright.html"},{"by":"avalexandrov","descendants":44,"id":22350829,"kids":[22351311,22352302,22351505,22352862,22351157,22351514,22351894,22351255],"score":66,"time":1581974054,"title":"Investor update on quarterly guidance","type":"story","url":"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/02/investor-update-on-quarterly-guidance/"},{"by":"samth","descendants":5,"id":22350647,"kids":[22351870,22357109],"score":42,"time":1581972874,"title":"Racket 7.6","type":"story","url":"https://blog.racket-lang.org/2020/02/racket-v7-6.html"},{"by":"ahuth","descendants":121,"id":22350664,"kids":[22352434,22352573,22353911,22351453,22351274,22354559,22351411,22351705,22362774,22353679,22356404,22352447,22356334,22355307,22364046,22362270,22356673,22354549,22353756,22352150,22352460,22380476,22356457,22356559,22354315,22356542,22351679],"score":397,"time":1581972943,"title":"Avoid rewriting a legacy system from scratch by strangling it","type":"story","url":"https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/avoid-rewriting-a-legacy-system-from-scratch-by-strangling-it/"},{"by":"dpapathanasiou","descendants":34,"id":22350562,"kids":[22350757,22350907,22351027,22356453,22350747,22350792,22350853,22351913,22350868,22364778,22355694,22350948,22350601,22353987,22350945,22351660,22350886,22350778,22353700,22353345],"score":39,"text":"I&#x27;m working on a new neural network based project, which means I&#x27;ll need to access and store more data than I can keep on my hard drives.<p>While I&#x27;m familiar with AWS S3 from my day job, I was wondering what other alternatives are out there that may be cheaper (or even free)?<p>I&#x27;m also aware of dropbox, google docs, etc., but ideally I&#x27;d like to have programmatic access via an API.","time":1581972304,"title":"Ask HN: cloud data storage cheaper than AWS S3?","type":"story"},{"by":"untitled-","descendants":10,"id":22350563,"kids":[22378742,22364225,22350721,22350956,22355436,22354610,22359815],"score":8,"time":1581972326,"title":"Ask HN: What is your method for self-studying math textbooks?","type":"story"},{"by":"burtonator","descendants":3,"id":22350496,"kids":[22356171,22350635,22350777],"score":2,"text":"Scammers are becoming more and more a problem for me... fake CL house rentals, people asking for banking information, etc.<p>The problem is that, for the most part, there&#x27;s no way to retaliate.<p>So I was thinking of doing an easy reverse fishing attack.<p>Basically you reply with:<p>&quot;Sure, here&#x27;s my banking info https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chasebankint.com&#x2F;1xv94&quot;<p>this URL SEEMS like a fake banking site but when you load it download a shock image, audio, locally, and then display these to the user.<p>A shock image is an image that&#x27;s VERY disgusting and can basically borderline cause brain damage.

There&#x27;s also an up-to-date roadmap (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;basisproject&#x2F;tracker#roadmap) which shows current progress.<p>Would love feedback, thoughts, contributions!","time":1581969093,"title":"Ask HN: Any anarchist/communist/socialist hackers here?","type":"story"},{"by":"boshomi","dead":true,"id":22350031,"kids":[22350351,22350040],"score":2,"time":1581968251,"title":"Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid [pdf](828p 31MB)","type":"story","url":"https://theswissbay.ch/pdf/Gentoomen%20Library/Extra/Douglas_R._Hofstadter-G%C3%B6del%2C_Escher%2C_Bach__An_Eternal_Golden_Braid_%28Twentieth-Anniversary_Edition%29-Basic_Books%281999%29.pdf"},{"by":"stazz1","descendants":3,"id":22350054,"kids":[22360440,22350194,22350260],"score":4,"text":"Check out https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digg.com&#x2F;about\n It says &quot;please don&#x27;t contact us&quot;  and there&#x27;s no way to submit stories.

We built a Chrome extension that uses real-time interventions to prevent people from unknowingly wasting time on online distractions.<p>A few months ago, I mentioned that I was spending too much time on Facebook. Omid recommended a browser extension to block certain sites. It worked well - my time wasted dropped to 15 minutes the next day. However, a few days later, I was setting up my company’s Facebook page, and the extension blocked me at the 15-min mark, the time I set for myself. I needed to finish that page, but there was no way around the hard-block, so I had to uninstall the extension.<p>Later, I tried other similar extensions. Each was either so permissive that it wasn&#x27;t useful for my purpose, or so strict that I had to uninstall it. We realized that existing solutions did not work because their approach is too prescriptive and simplistic. They didn’t recognize that people also need to use Facebook, Youtube, etc. for legitimate purposes. The problem is really intricate. On one hand, Facebook is great for getting reminders on friends’ birthdays or managing business pages; on the other hand, every minute spent on Facebook could potentially lead to a trap. These traps come in all forms - video autoplay, news articles with catchy titles, and sponsored content that looks just like your friends’ posts. Instead of always being hindered from visiting these sites, I needed to have access to their useful parts, but be careful to not get distracted in the process.<p>I decided to build a simple tool for myself - a countdown timer each time I visit a distracting site. We all started using it and liked it, so we decided to hand out the extension to some friends. Surprisingly, despite many bugs, our user retention was infinitely higher than our previous ideas. In fact, we built 6 MVPs during our pivoting process - commission-free prediction market, recruiting platform for quant traders, intercity carpooling service, workplace motivation app, online travel agency, and crypto options market making (last one because both Ethan and I were options traders before our startup; Omid was a college student until this year. For backstory - Ethan and I were best friends in college, and Omid and I have been friends since high school) Since none of these ideas had worked and we were finally getting some users, we decided to work on this one. Also, with this one we were solving a problem that we ourselves had.<p>Here’s how it works now: each time you visit a distracting site (e.g. Twitter), we show a screen where you can choose to either leave or proceed to the site with a visible countdown timer. On sites like Facebook and Youtube, you can choose to hide the newsfeed or video recommendations. Once time is up, we ask you whether you&#x27;re done. When you visit less distracting sites such as Gmail, you get reminders on how long you’ve been on these sites, so you don&#x27;t unknowingly spend too long on things like responding to email.<p>Before you start working on something, you can write down your task, and it will show up with a timer on every tab you visit until you clear the task, so you don&#x27;t get sidetracked. Finally, every morning, we give you a report on how you spent your time the previous day, and allow you to mark the sites that are distracting.<p>We firmly believe in data privacy, and promise that we will never sell user data. We do not collect the URL or content of sites you visit. We had to decide between using Chrome&#x27;s &quot;all_urls&quot; permission and the more narrow &quot;activeTab&quot; permission. If we only had activeTab, each time the user opens a new page they would have to manually activate our extension. That would be an unacceptable user experience in our opinion, so we settled on the broader permission.<p>The extension is free at the moment. We plan on releasing for other browsers in the upcoming weeks. We plan on monetizing either through a premium tier with productivity tools built for power users or charging a very low amount from every user.<p>Big tech companies have been attacking our attention with sophisticated technology, spending billions of dollars to optimize their engagement metrics. We may think we are in control, but often we are unknowingly being exploited by companies who profit handsomely off our attention—which, if you think about it, is the most valuable asset we have. If we could just simply turn off all these products, that would be an effective defense, but for many people that&#x27;s not an option, so something more is required.<p>It&#x27;s far from complete, but we believe we&#x27;re on the road to building a more useful tool to help individuals defend their attention against these traps. This is a problem many in the HN community have thought a lot about. We’d really love your feedback and learn what you would like to see in a tool like this - what productivity problem do you have that a tool could help solve? How can tooling help to give us back control over our own attention? Thanks so much in advance!<p>Harry, Ethan, and Omid","time":1581962615,"title":"Launch HN: Motion (YC W20) – defense against online distractions and addictions","type":"story"},{"by":"weare138","descendants":149,"id":22349363,"kids":[22350349,22350281,22349895,22353413,22350992,22353425,22353627,22353382,22353066,22352093,22354832,22353399,22364334,22352381,22353259,22352723,22352337,22353678,22349649,22352486],"score":138,"time":1581962916,"title":"An investigation of the Pentagon's UFO program","type":"story","url":"https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/research/a30916275/government-secret-ufo-program-investigation/"},{"by":"hskel","descendants":38,"id":22349303,"kids":[22349632,22349810,22349705,22350228,22349574,22349626,22349762,22349580,22349850],"score":44,"time":1581962357,"title":"Schizophrenia Manifests as a GitHub Repo","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/botupdate/botupdate"},{"by":"DalekBaldwin","descendants":3,"id":22349299,"kids":[22355001,22354955,22356448],"score":37,"time":1581962320,"title":"Interactive visualization of Kerr spherical photon orbits (2016)","type":"story","url":"https://duetosymmetry.com/tool/kerr-circular-photon-orbits/"},{"by":"ingve","descendants":22,"id":22349148,"kids":[22350531,22350412,22350481,22353358,22351326,22352576,22349422],"score":96,"time":1581960752,"title":"Thought Experiment: An Introductory Compilers Class","type":"story","url":"https://semantic-domain.blogspot.com/2020/02/thought-experiment-introductory.html"},{"by":"arabadzhiev","descendants":36,"id":22349000,"kids":[22349503,22349713,22349518,22350976,22349490,22349773,22349572,22350029,22349224,22371725,22349456],"score":35,"time":1581959136,"title":"Marketers are panicking over Google's plan to yank cookies from advertising","type":"story","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/advertisers-are-panicking-over-googles-plan-to-ditch-cookies-2020-2"},{"by":"stackdestroyer","descendants":2,"id":22348990,"kids":[22349289,22349472],"score":4,"text":"I&#x27;m looking to get some perspective on my own schedule from this diverse group of folks.

What HNers usually upvote to the front page apart from tech is a well-filtered mixture of literature&#x2F;journalism&#x2F;culture&#x2F;nature&#x2F;craftsmanship etc. Is there any other place like this on the internet, or I still have to filter HN myself?","time":1581871542,"title":"Ask HN: HN-like site but without the tech content?","type":"story"},{"by":"throwaway894028","descendants":62,"id":22342317,"kids":[22343923,22344211,22343281,22344715,22343649,22343212,22343868,22343685,22343122,22343651,22343203,22343237,22344019,22358513,22373091,22344145,22347879,22344794,22343200,22343304,22354544,22344142,22347781,22364514,22353280,22369686,22352308,22343700,22343455,22343193,22343430,22343940],"score":36,"text":"When I encounter what I strongly believe to be indefensibly poor design, I get feelings of anger and depression; anger that such stupid decisions could be made and that I must deal with them, and depression that I am largely powerless to change the situation.  In particular, poor design that is part of public service (subways, signs, etc) really makes me feel as though I am getting exploited, and for some reason I almost actually feel they are personal attacks on me.<p>I currently try to justify why poor design decisions are made and to give the &quot;system&quot; the benefit of doubt. Perhaps there are cost constraints, time constraints, or perhaps the intended use case is not the one I am in -- but a lot of the time I arrive at this conclusion: &quot;this design is simply indefensible -- had the creator, or anybody involved actually <i></i>tried<i></i> the design, just once, surely they would notice the problems and fix this&quot;.  Furthermore, the fixes are sometimes very obvious. So, I think to myself, is the whole world just lazy? Stupid? Apathetic? Why would somebody make this thing the way it is, and think it is acceptable?<p>I had listed examples, ranging from NYC subway gripes, double doors where one door is locked and the handles are ambiguous, cell phone gripes, google maps, windows, etc, but there is no space for it in this post. So, for the sake of helping me, please just assume that my assessments of certain designs are accurate, and that they are undeniably awful, and had the designer(s) attempted to use their design once they would have realize this -- and that it&#x27;s not just me.<p>Lastly, and more to the point, I feel awful that such banalities can have such a profound effect on me. I realize that I may come off as whiny or arrogant or whatever -- I accept that. But it really, truly, pisses me off when I encounter bad user experience, and I honestly don&#x27;t want it to.

have been in IT and software roles for 3 decades, yet nowhere near retirement. I still get a lot of stuff done (solo and teams), but only feel productive when pragmatic approaches are taken.

Problem is, most of my company insists on first developing fully fledged platforms that attempt to solve years of future assumptions, while the business waits and engineers work excessive hours.<p>If I suggest a simpler prototype approach, incorporating internal customer feedback, with a second long term cycle of engineering, the response from peers and management borders on disdain or contempt. I am a team lead and get this response from all angles.<p>I’m no tech stick in the mud. Where scripting and RDBMS worked for 20 years, I incorporate “new things” where needed: Go for speed, Spark and S3 where vertical systems don’t scale; Rust when performance of a non-GC language is needed.<p>Conflict occurs when I resist over engineering: _Everything_ in a container; Kubernetes by default, as in 10 node clusters (am aware of its utility in much larger deployments);  Clever code that will be extra work for future contributors to grok. Anywhere resume driven development appears to be creeping in.<p>I believe one of the responsibilities of management (and team leads) is to reign in architecture astronauts, but I  rarely see it and am discouraged from doing so, in some cases due to fear of upsetting the “10X engineers” [1].<p>I have seen this across 4 companies in 15 years, with increasing severity.

I started at the bottom, worked my way to the top after 3 years, and I&#x27;ve been here since. For a couple years I created new positions for myself because I hate being stagnant, but there&#x27;s nothing else to do here.<p>I&#x27;m proficient in many things and enjoy doing all of them. Development (full stack), server admin, data center management, DevOps, project management, managing teams, VoIP, routing&#x2F;switching, training, sales... the list goes on.<p>My issue is I haven&#x27;t had formal training in a lot of it, and I didn&#x27;t have any mentors or people above me to teach me more because this company is too small. I just love learning and love moving forward so I kept teaching myself new things, and then using them in the company. I don&#x27;t actually feel like I have impostor syndrome, but I also feel like someone that is filling these roles at another company probably knows&#x2F;does it better job than I can. I&#x27;m just a big fish in a small pond here.<p>So finally to my question: what role&#x2F;job title I should be looking for? All the searching I do points me to one specific roles. PHP Developer.

A straightforward, quick way of sharing knowledge where and when it matters most.”<p>He believes it has the potential to become the standard of modern Q&amp;A.<p>Quemuse boasts an impressive array of features, from advanced direct-messaging to an interesting kudos system. A Quemuse on-site chatroom is also underway, which the company hopes will further serve to engage users.<p>Quemuse is a social Q&amp;A platform that curates the latest and hottest questions of all topics asked by users like you. Discuss the topics and interests you love, such as gaming, tech, sports, science, news, and endless more. You can ask questions instantly at any time or create fun polls to get a variety of awesome answers. Additionally, find yourself discovering intriguing and thought-provoking questions with excellent and thoughtful answers on topics you follow.<p>Quemuse has been featured on the front-page of ProductHunt on the initial day of launch.

So no PDT, CET, nor UTC +2 -7 is needed anymore. It&#x27;s an extended clock concept utilizing a new UTC, a UTC that rotates with you according to you location on Earth. The clock knows where you are in the globe and adjusts itself for you. This unifies the reading of time everywhere. Thus, time zone math can be eliminated.<p>Other solutions out there couldn&#x27;t help me, unfortunately. Almost all of them work by stacking different times zone together, which doesn&#x27;t really solve the problem from the roots. Calculations are still needed in many use cases, which makes no sense. There should be one language of time everywhere, a global time. It&#x27;s there and is called UTC, but the problem is that it&#x27;s not integrated in our daily life. This clock does that.<p>The idea is to have a unified time zone that works for all locations on earth by using the same time system we all know (24 hours, 60 minutes, 60 seconds) and adding on top of it a rotating UTC layer as the global time. This layer is presented in alphabet.

I&#x27;m Matt White, co-founder of Commerce, along with Nathan Martin (centipixel) and Daniel Newman (over-engineered). Commerce is a drop-in e-commerce platform for any website from a single line of JavaScript. You can find us here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;static.tools&#x2F;commerce<p>With this single include, you get a shopping cart, account registration and login (Email, Google, Facebook, etc), live shipping quotes, invoicing, and the ability to sell complex product variants (composite&#x2F;configurable products, delta pricing, fractional pricing, wholesale pricing, etc). Much of this is configurable via an administrative interface we&#x27;ve built up alongside the product.<p>From individual clients we&#x27;ve onboarded onto the system, we&#x27;ve already processed over 2 million dollars in transactions - a drop in the bucket compared to most of the other players in the market, but we&#x27;re proud of it!<p>Before Commerce, the three of us consulted full-time as a team with a focus on static&#x2F;Jamstack sites. We have over 30 years of agency and consulting experience between us (we&#x27;re all mid-30s). Commerce was born out of a need to supply an e-commerce solution to a client, while still maintaining a static build. It was so successful, we decided to split off the product as it&#x27;s own business, and Commerce was born.<p>As a company, we applied (late) to YC&#x27;s W19 batch and didn&#x27;t make the cut - and are currently working through Startup School as we work towards a full public launch.\nWe&#x27;re hoping to follow-up with a Launch HN in the coming weeks, but in the meantime this is our first time exposing the product to anyone who isn&#x27;t a direct client of ours, so we&#x27;re happy to take questions. And if it&#x27;s a product you&#x27;re interested in, we&#x27;d love it if you hopped over to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;static.tools&#x2F;commerce and signed up for our launch announcements.<p>Thanks!<p>Site: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;static.tools<p>Demo: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.static.tools<p>Docs: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.static.tools","time":1581368864,"title":"Show HN: Commerce – Drop in e-commerce for any website","type":"story"},{"by":"fbn79","descendants":26,"id":22293285,"kids":[22293591,22293672,22294691,22293883],"score":37,"time":1581368494,"title":"A mysterious 80 nm amoeba virus with a near-complete “ORFan genome”","type":"story","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.923185v1"},{"by":"mc3","descendants":8,"id":22293260,"kids":[22293676,22294445,22294805,22295134,22294016],"score":14,"time":1581368380,"title":"What You Need to Know About Magnesium and Your Sleep","type":"story","url":"https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/sleep-newzzz/201805/what-you-need-know-about-magnesium-and-your-sleep"},{"by":"BryanBeshore","dead":true,"id":22293262,"kids":[22294364,22294340,22294304,22294309,22293316,22294346],"score":12,"time":1581368399,"title":"Is Ruby on Rails Dead?","type":"story","url":"http://israilsdead.com"},{"by":"haxel","descendants":15,"id":22293182,"kids":[22294437,22294931,22293318,22295142,22293697,22295764,22294763,22295474,22293973,22293898],"score":22,"time":1581368060,"title":"Boomers got houses and good jobs.

I&#x27;ve noticed this phenomenon first-hand in Silicon Valley.<p>I do believe that these efforts mean well, and come from a good place. Diversity of ideas is very important for building successful products for a diverse audience - there is no doubt about that. However, there are two things that leave me puzzled:<p>1) I feel that it has become a matter of one-upmanship between companies, with huge emphasis on proudly touting how many black or latinx people they hired last quarter ([1], [2] to name a few).<p>2) Related to 1), the emphasis on equality of outcome, rather than equality of opportunity. I think Goodhart&#x27;s Law is at play here (&#x27;When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.&#x27;). &quot;Diverse people hired&quot; may be becoming a lousy metric that doesn&#x27;t account for differences in talent pool size, enrolment in schools, number of people interviewed, etc. A very common phrase, especially used at one of my former employers, was this idea of &quot;overcoming a homogenous workplace&quot;.<p>There are diversity teams at most big tech firms geared to drive up these metrics - just like any other team which is driven by ad revenue or MAU.<p>At my ex-employer, hiring managers were invited by a &#x27;diversity lead&#x27; and told to &#x27;account for diversity&#x27; when candidates are fairly even; in this case, the other candidate is placed at a disadvantage.<p>I am not trying to be inflammatory here; I just want to learn how these programs are bringing real benefit - or at least the underlying reasoning&#x2F;legislation driving them.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qz.com&#x2F;work&#x2F;1793500&#x2F;etsy-doubled-its-hiring-of-black-and-latinx-employees-in-one-year&#x2F;<p>[2]

HNers,<p>Lately I&#x27;ve been thinking about my &quot;software&#x2F;digital situation&quot; through observing my daily habits. I&#x27;ve been hoarding data (e-mails, pictures, docs, passwords, todos, notes, etc) that are stored in the cloud through mostly reliable free services.<p>As I get older, I noticed that I&#x27;ve become a little bit concerned with the situation where I may not be able to use this services due to the usual reasons folks shared in HN.<p>I&#x27;ve been considering one path to get out of this situation: use local-first app (desktop&#x2F;console&#x2F;web-app). The only thing I have to be careful is the data format: they should be standard data format such as: txt, pdf, [png,jpeg,etc for pics], open-file-format such as ODF. I know there are tons of FOSS desktop&#x2F;console apps&#x2F;host-yourself-web-app out there but there is a small caveat: I&#x27;d like to stick with them for as long as I can with minimum upgrade cycle :) so that if the software has been abandoned, I don&#x27;t want to deal with the situation where the base OS upgraded and the software no longer works.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t mind using dropbox&#x2F;rsync&#x2F;tarsnap in order to resolve the sync situation whether real-time sync or daily backups.<p>Given these parameters, there is a good possibility that I might have to write my own tools to solve certain personal workflow.<p>Would you recommend Java, C, C++, or Python for cross-platforms software&#x2F;tooling and why?\nJava: I have strong background in Java, love the tools+ecosystem. Caveats: JRE, Oracle, new language feature churns (I can choose not to)\nC&#x2F;C++: only touched them in college, tools aren&#x27;t great, willing to learn, need guidance for best-practices&#x2F;minimize effort. Lots of folks I admired stick with C&#x2F;C++ to build their tools. I respect that. C&#x2F;C++ based-software seemed to require minimum upgrade too (not too many dependency)\nPython: Used Python occasionally. Caveats: small concern with upgrade story (Python2-Python3-&gt;future, lib binding).<p>Thoughts?","time":1581180068,"title":"Ask HN: Java, C, C++, or Python for cross-platform GUI and

While I&#x27;ve created a few basic web sites for money, it has mainly been a hobby for me, and one I greatly enjoy. I&#x27;ve written simple 2D video games (C++), simple chatbots (Python), quiz-generating systems(JS-PHP-MySQL), etc., so I&#x27;m not totally clueless about this stuff. However, there seems to be a very real, and quite frankly disappointing <i>limit</i> to what my brain is able to do. For example, I have recently joined HackerRank, and have been working on several of the problems. I don&#x27;t know what it is, but for some reason even some of the problems marked <i>easy</i> are incredibly hard for me to figure out. While I&#x27;ve successfully answered the majority of the problems I&#x27;ve attempted there, there are some that, based on the number of successful submissions and the rank of <i>easy</i> MUST be simple and yet I&#x27;ve spent sometimes 2 hours on those and cannot produce a program that passes all the tests. That&#x27;s very discouraging because I want to become a better programmer but I feel I may have reached the limit of what my brain can do. Has anyone experienced anything like this? If so, were you able to figure it out and improve your problem-solving skill set? Thanks for any advice you could offer!","time":1581112849,"title":"I can write programs but can't solve problems.

Take a job offer with a larger software company doing the same L2&#x2F;L3 support tasks as my current role.

Self study. I&#x27;m spending every free moment working on personal projects and studying, but I cap out at about 2 hours per work day (I work a 10 hours+ per day at the moment) and 6 hours per weekend day. I would like to spend a few months tweaking my projects&#x2F;developing my skills further (I&#x27;m still a bit off getting an interview based on discussions with developers at work, but not <i>that</i> far off) and then start applying for the jobs I&#x27;m interested in.<p>Everyone in my life is telling me to take the job offer, be happy with a pay bump,  and spend the next 5 years finishing my degree part-time before looking for a career change.

I&#x27;m back in grad school now for a masters in statistics, and am hoping to transition away from Oracle programming (my last job) to data science.<p>I&#x27;m feeling overwhelmed by the sheer number of technologies out there that I &quot;should&quot; learn: Python and R (and their libraries), Spark, Hadoop, TensorFlow, and pytorch. You also need to know how to productionalize things: Docker, AWS, distributed databases, the latest web stuff (sockets?), etc. I could spend all the time in the world learning the new tech, and by the time I&#x27;m done, it&#x27;ll be outdated by the new stuff. It&#x27;s exhausting, and I don&#x27;t know if I have the drive (or mental health) to commit to a career where I could be replaced when I&#x27;m 50 by a young lion fresh out of college who knows the latest stuff and is willing to work for pennies on the dollar.<p>When I was 21 I felt confident in my abilities; 10 years later, I don&#x27;t at all.

I think I know less than the undergrads at my university, and I think I give up on things more quickly now than I used to. At my first job, when my peers started to move on to grad school or higher roles other companies, I admired what they were doing, but I was afraid of the unknown at the time, in a toxic relationship, and had some decision paralysis about whether this was the right career fro me.

The moment you may say one simple negative thing about a company on social media, if it gets no views, or gets down-voted, that may well be a case of brigading. A lot of these social media sites, like Reddit have removed most of the indicators we previously had to tell us what was realm and now it&#x27;s easy for one user to register multiple accounts, and a click farm to register thousands of accounts.<p>Now that companies have brought in new blood, they realize the power of brigading. It&#x27;s covert, can be very subtle, and when combined with the learned expertise of click farms, it can generate lots of sales, remove legal hurdles, and even make painful lawsuits simply go away, among other uses. New companies, even new political candidates, hire and recruit groups to create brigades, we&#x27;re talking about groups that suppress valid information about safety and public policy that we would normally be able to read online, they diminish our ability to see real and trustworthy feedback and stories, and they are now frequently used to drive deception in stock markets.<p>I&#x27;ll keep this post short and follow up in comments, but there are several ways permitting online brigading by companies and political candidates can go very wrong for the world.

Their beloved old Toshiba became unusable after it tricked them into updating to Windows 10, so, they bought a new, reasonable-seeming Dell all-in-one for 600 bucks. Apparently it arrived broken, and they returned it and got another. Same result, so I decided to take a look.<p>(They don&#x27;t see why a computer should cost more than 600 bucks with taxes and shipping, and they want Windows (7), which they think of as &quot;how a computer should be.&quot; Before anyone suggests an iPad, they&#x27;ll consider it when it&#x27;s 24&quot;, easy on the eyes, and sits on the computer desk in the computer corner.)<p>Anyway, out of the box it takes 10 minutes to get to the desktop and then pegs the disk. I figure it&#x27;s updating itself and give it a good half day to do as it pleases. Now it&#x27;s updated and not much better. I remove all the crapware, disable all the telemetry junk, generally remove everything I can. It&#x27;s better, but still takes ages to get to usable and occasionally pegs the disk with various Windows processes. Because it does so sporadically, the performance drops confuse the hell out of my parents, who think THEY are doing something wrong.<p>I figure: Windows 10 Home has its own agenda and always will. That means it will never perform well without an SSD, and my parents will never have an SSD at their price-point. So, what to do? Invest a day to see if I can coerce Windows into behaving? I haven&#x27;t used it in a long time, and I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll succeed. Convince them to switch to better hardware or an iMac? The cost, new UX and their stubbornness are a problem. Or wipe Windows and install the Pro edition? I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll cost me and not sure it&#x27;ll be better behaved.<p>Or, install Linux (probably Mint), hope they like it and it likes their cheapie computer, and hope for the best.

the scenario: You have a bus driver with a smartphone connected to the internet. Then you have the passengers(who have booked seats on the bus) with smartphones as well but NO internet connection. The bus will pick up passengers at every stop and each of these passengers needs to quickly perform a &quot;check-in&quot; once they on board (there&#x27;s no internet on the bus either). Because of budget constraints, it is not possible to provide internet on the bus or install any 3rd party device (like QR code reader) that could handle check-ins.<p>Ideally what should happen is: The passengers&#x27; offline phone somehow communicates quickly to the drivers and shares its boarding id (Bluetooth conns are a hassle and won&#x27;t work well when multiple people onboarding).

Since I came to this country, I have never returned to my home country. However, I get along well with my family who still live in my home country, and we are in regular contact by phone or internet. Since I started working here, I rarely take my holidays.  The few times I have taken time off, I didn&#x27;t really know what else to do to keep myself busy, apart from sleeping, hanging out on the internet, playing video games... I have acquaintances here but I would hardly call them friends. I also don&#x27;t have any close family or boyfriend here. And I&#x27;m fine with it. But usually, when my colleagues come back from holidays, they talk about their travels (which seems to be a habit for the middle class in this country) and activities they did. So now I don&#x27;t take very long periods of time off to not be bothered telling what I did during my holidays. I just take two or three days, consecutive or not, just to rest a little bit. I have to say that not taking leave has also allowed me to negotiate pay raises a few times during my performance reviews, but I&#x27;m afraid that&#x27;s not enough anymore, even if my boss are very satisfied with my job. That&#x27;s the first problem I have.\nThe second is the questions I may have from my colleagues or superiors. The questions that come up most often are: Why don&#x27;t you take some time off? Why have you never returned to your home country? Don&#x27;t you miss your family&#x2F;country? What did you do during your holidays?\nUsually, I got through it by changing the subject as quickly as possible or by making a little joke. But I&#x27;m getting tired of it all and I&#x27;m running out of ideas too. I wish I didn&#x27;t have to answer these questions anymore or answer them without being judged and without lying.\nFor what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m a girl, although I doubt it matters.","time":1580690245,"title":"Foreigner Not Taking Holidays","type":"story"},{"by":"cryptozeus","descendants":26,"id":22220382,"kids":[22221044,22220973,22220870,22220730,22220557,22220552,22220556,22221251,22221068,22220723],"score":75,"time":1580688142,"title":"Happiness is more like poetry than algorithms","type":"story","url":"https://nav.al/math"},{"by":"DyslexicAtheist","descendants":71,"id":22220342,"kids":[22221592,22222039,22222555,22222692,22221227,22224474,22221454,22221843,22222726,22221984,22222544,22221608],"score":137,"time":1580687654,"title":"Pointer Compression in V8","type":"story","url":"https://blog.infosectcbr.com.au/2020/02/pointer-compression-in-v8.html"},{"by":"shill","descendants":11,"id":22220308,"kids":[22221124,22223681,22220932,22220651],"score":48,"time":1580687282,"title":"Cocktail of flu, HIV drugs appears to help fight coronavirus: Thai doctors","type":"story","url":"https://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1ZW0GQ"},{"by":"Bostonian","descendants":2,"id":22220248,"kids":[22220422,22220252],"score":1,"time":1580686708,"title":"Is It Fair to Award Scholarships Based on the Sat?

there,<p>Mailgun is adjusting our plans and pricing to more accurately reflect the value users get from the service and to make room for some great new deliverability features we just released.<p>Throughout 2019, we were hard at work adding and improving our email capabilities and optimizing our support to help your business grow. While many of these updates were made behind the scenes, the truth is that Mailgun can do a lot more than it could two years ago when we last updated our plans.<p>What does this mean for you? \nOn March 1, 2020, we will automatically transition your account to the new Flex plan, a pay-as-you-go plan comparable to the Concept plan you’re currently on. You’ll receive your first invoice under the new plan on April 1 if your amount due is greater than $0.50. According to your usage last month, your invoice under the new price per message of $0.0008 would have been $0 for December. It’s a modest change, but we wanted to be transparent about it.<p>What’s changing with the Flex plan? \nFlex offers you the same pay-per-use model you were used to on the Concept plan. The main differences are that we are no longer offering 10,000 free emails or 100 free validations per month, and our support options now include limited ticket support as well as enhanced self-service Q&amp;As so you can find answers faster. Additionally, while your existing routes will still be functional, new routes will not be supported on this plan.<p>What other options do I have? \nWe have several other plans available with additional features and service levels, including a new subscription plan called Foundation that starts at $35 per month. This plan provides access to new deliverability tools like Inbox Placement so you can effortlessly increase your deliverability and email ROI.<p>Looking for validations, inbound routing, or more support? Foundation is a great starter plan. If this is something you’re interested in, check out your plan options.","time":1580401423,"title":"Tell HN: Mailgun lowers free-tier API from 10k to 625 emails per month","type":"story"},{"by":"pulisse","descendants":28,"id":22192430,"kids":[22192529,22192695,22192680,22192664,22192847,22192725,22192750,22192757,22192741,22192705,22192729,22192676,22192896,22192734],"score":31,"time":1580400645,"title":"Facebook Won’t Remove This Woman’s Butthole as a Business Page","type":"story","url":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/facebook-butthole-business"},{"by":"amamaghani","descendants":2,"id":22192374,"kids":[22254971,22192405],"score":1,"text":"CryptoMood app helps traders to make better investment decisions with crypto sentiment analysis tools that use artificial intelligence and data from 50,000+ sources to uncover early trading signals.<p>Cryptomoods&#x27; market sentiment app analyses the latest data from 10+ News aggregators, 4 Social Media Networks, 50,000+ News sources, 100+ trading and crypto blogs to help crypto traders with:\n Detecting the direction in which the crypto market will move.\n Identifying whether market sentiment is strong or weak.\n Exposing a possible reversal ⏪ of the crypto market.\n Deciding to trade, hold position or exit position.<p>CryptoMood applies and enhances the Neural Networks used for FOREX trading to cryptocurrency trading in order to provide comprehensive real-time views of the crypto market sentiment.<p>ℹ️ Features of this app<p>️ Massive Data Mining<p>We process data from 50,000+ News sources, 10+ News aggregators, Twitter, Facebook and 2 other Social Networks, 100+ trading and crypto blogs<p>️ Natural Language Processing and Understanding<p>With the help of NLP &amp; ML, Cryptomood&#x27;s sentiment analysis tools can accurately analyse text and measure crypto market sentiment<p>️ Advanced Artificial Intelligence Algorithms  (Market Impact Analysis)<p>Our crypto sentiment analysis tools use high complexity artificial intelligence algorithms to analyse market sentiment and uncover crypto trading signals<p>️ Whale  Movements and Tether Emissions<p>To analyse crypto market sentiment, track the largest crypto wallets&#x27; movements and significant cash-crypto conversions","time":1580400332,"title":"CryptoMood – Description","type":"story"},{"by":"hailwren","descendants":4,"id":22192195,"kids":[22192380,22192336,22199632,22193092],"score":2,"text":"We&#x27;ve had these things for years, and Apple is forcing anyone who wants a new Macbook to adopt one now.

I have been homeless in Los Angeles for the past 2 years. Prior to this, I was a developer for over 10 years. Mostly I worked at small startups.  And let me just get the stereotypes out of the way: I don&#x27;t do drugs, I don&#x27;t drink, I&#x27;m not a criminal, and I&#x27;m not mentally ill. I&#x27;m just a spectacularly unlucky coder who worked for a series of not so great startups that failed, slowly ran out of money and savings between jobs, and fell through the cracks to become totally stranded living on the streets. I have no family to ask for help--only-child, parents deceased. The only reason I have survived this long was by working part-time on 2 remote contracting gigs, but I was paid sub-minimum wage. It&#x27;s extremely difficult to do remote development work without electricity nor WiFi. The Public Library and Starbucks have been life savers.<p>I am now down to my last $40 dollars and I am panicking.  That&#x27;s it. I expect to run out of food in about 4 days. Then I guess it&#x27;s the end for me. But I refuse to lay on the sidewalk and starve while pedestrians step over me. I&#x27;m afraid I am going to be pushed into doing something dire that there is no coming back from. I wish it were otherwise, but that&#x27;s the one thing I still have control over, so I&#x27;ll do it on my own terms.<p>The nearest food bank to where I camp is over a 10 mile walk away, but what they provide requires refrigeration and a stove. You&#x27;d think there would be more food banks for the homeless in the 2nd biggest city in America, which is also home to over 20 billionaires. Food stamps are not an option for me because they tell me I don&#x27;t qualify, due to the new Federal rule change (Thanks Trump). Local assistance from the city welfare office is needlessly complicated and I have been shocked to discover just how little is actually available.","time":1580358314,"title":"Homeless Developer in Los Angeles Needs Work, Can You Please Help?","type":"story"},{"by":"Patient0","descendants":91,"id":22188800,"kids":[22191206,22187679,22191200,22188096,22186753,22187454,22192710,22189072,22189157,22189942,22189213,22186866,22189128,22188399,22189120,22190872,22189249,22189243],"score":336,"time":1580357846,"title":"Sun's surface seen in  new detail","type":"story","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-51305216"},{"by":"colinprince","descendants":8,"id":22188775,"kids":[22189741,22191082,22189883],"score":36,"time":1580357444,"title":"Jeremy’s notes on fastai coding style","type":"story","url":"https://docs.fast.ai/dev/style.html"},{"by":"jonny383","descendants":2,"id":22188742,"kids":[22190488,22188966,22189099],"score":11,"time":1580356967,"title":"Google Chrome Tests Replacing URLs with Search Queries in Address Bar","type":"story","url":"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/google/google-chrome-tests-replacing-urls-with-search-queries-in-address-bar/"},{"by":"shakna","descendants":184,"id":22188704,"kids":[22189902,22189284,22189282,22191471,22192801,22190498,22189354,22191072,22190088,22191950,22189776,22189893,22193685,22189785,22191142,22192889,22189894,22189931,22193706,22191507,22206346,22198458,22191091,22189336,22191627,22188837,22189635,22189308,22193379,22193118,22193125,22189827,22189500,22191039,22190208,22189611,22189748,22189796,22190638,22190767,22193503],"score":348,"time":1580356370,"title":"Let's Destroy C","type":"story","url":"https://gist.github.com/shakna-israel/4fd31ee469274aa49f8f9793c3e71163#lets-destroy-c"},{"by":"sarcasmatwork","descendants":20,"id":22188661,"kids":[22190682,22189403,22190475,22188980,22188731,22188901,22188951],"score":57,"time":1580355762,"title":"U.K. Police Will Soon Be Able to Search Through U.S. Data Without Asking a Judge","type":"story","url":"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/01/uk-police-will-soon-be-able-search-through-us-data-without-asking-judge"},{"by":"kleinvin","descendants":3,"id":22188690,"kids":[22188726,22189173],"score":1,"text":"Would you pay for expert advice before making a purchase?<p>For example say you want to start playing guitar, you pay to be connected to a guitarist that gives you personalized advice on what best guitar to buy.

Reduce Bugs: more eyeballs on code == more chances to catch and reduce bugs or improve code quality.<p>E.g. Imagine a principle engineer who obviously cannot be put on every pr review, but still wants to watch things closely that are very important. This could be changes to a &#x2F;models folder or a dependencies file or recent module they worked on.<p>2. Boost Learning: developers can follow exactly the types of code they are interested in, and from which developers who wrote it.<p>E.g. imagine you want to learn more React, you could set a rule that will notify you anytime any brand new react file gets merged to master from your team&#x27;s codebase. If you wanted you, you could also, limit it to only a specific developer(s).<p>If you already suffer from notification fatigue in Slack - there will be optional aggregated digests that you can schedule as once a day, instead.<p>Philosophically:<p>1. The best PR reviewer != the person who could benefit the most from reviewing&#x2F;learning from a PR. This falls into the circumstance where you want to share a pr with someone not for your review...but for their benefit.<p>2. You should be able to follow the changes to the codebase that you care about. Whether you want to learn from more people on your team, or make sure someone doesn&#x27;t mess with your beautiful code, or just simply staying informed of changes, like to your model.<p>Questions:<p>1. Would you use this? (If so, please sign up to prove it hehe).\n2. Does this seem like a problem that your team would pay for?\n3. Do you have any problems with the native Github&#x2F;Slack integration or problems in general, that I could solve with my app, Code Collate?<p>Bonus: any feedback is extremely welcomed.

We&#x27;re Josh, Sean, and Cyrus from Deviceplane (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deviceplane.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deviceplane.com&#x2F;</a>).<p>Deviceplane is an open source device management tool for embedded systems, IoT, and edge computing. More specifically, we manage any device running Linux. These can be found in many different categories of hardware such as single-board computers (Raspberry Pis, Jetson Nanos), IoT devices&#x2F;gateways, and servers running at the edge.<p>The use cases for Linux devices span many different verticals&#x2F;industries: robotics, consumer appliances, drones, autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and much more. Your first thought might be that a tool for managing robots and a tool for managing medical devices are quite different, but after talking to a variety of companies, we&#x27;ve found that the pain points across these industries are actually quite similar!<p>Deviceplane solves the biggest infrastructure problems for these use cases:<p><pre><code>  - Orchestrating and deployment of remote updates\n  - Network connectivity and SSH access\n  - Host and application monitoring\n  - Device organization: naming, labeling, searching, and filtering of devices\n  - Access and security controls\n</code></pre>\nDeviceplane is designed to support a variety of hardware, from small embedded devices to large x86 servers. Today’s tooling ecosystem suffers from being segmented by hardware size.<p>For smaller devices, the Yocto project is popular. While it&#x27;s good for building custom Linux installations, it has downsides for delivering applications. It&#x27;s hard to understand, can take hours to compile, and solves only a portion of the problems present in device management.<p>For larger devices, many companies seem to build and maintain their own internal tooling. We&#x27;ve seen everything from systems built around configuration management to scripts polling for new Debian packages in S3. These systems are usually brittle, fall short of a complete feature set, and drain precious engineering resources with their maintenance.<p>We think Deviceplane is a great replacement for all of these. Not only is it suitable for all of these hardware sizes, it also presents a way to standardize the tooling across them.<p>One of our goals with Deviceplane is to make device management more accessible to developers. To do this, we build on technologies and concepts popularized in cloud deployments:<p><pre><code>  - Applications are packaged as containers and defined in a format resembling Docker Compose\n  - Updates can be rolled out and tested gradually by using &quot;canary&quot; deployments\n  - An intuitive and scriptable CLI that will feel familiar to Docker and Kubernetes users\n</code></pre>\nDeviceplane integrates with your device by running a lightweight static binary via your system supervisor. We can be used with nearly any Linux distro, which means you can continue using Ubuntu, Raspbian, a Yocto build, or whatever else fits your needs.<p>Deviceplane is completely open source. The code for everything from the agent to the backend and UI can be found on GitHub (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;deviceplane&#x2F;deviceplane\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;deviceplane&#x2F;deviceplane</a>). We put a lot of effort into making our open source version as easy as possible to run. You can even run the backend of Deviceplane with a single Docker command:<p>docker run -d --restart=unless-stopped -p 8080:8080 deviceplane&#x2F;deviceplane<p>For more information on hosting Deviceplane yourself, check out our docs (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deviceplane.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;self-hosted&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deviceplane.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;self-hosted&#x2F;</a>).<p>If you&#x27;d rather jump right into managing devices, we have a hosted version available at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.deviceplane.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.deviceplane.com&#x2F;</a>.<p>Lastly, we&#x27;d love to hear more about your experiences managing devices!

From Dell I can get the same spec, with a 10th gen CPU, for about £500 less.<p>I&#x27;ve used Mac for the last 18 or so years and would consider myself a Pro user, but it feels like madness to spend over £2000 on a machine that&#x27;s on an older spec CPU than most competitors, for a lot more price.<p>If anyone from Apple is reading this, screw you for making the emoji bar mandatory and not giving the 13&quot; MBP a physical escape key.","time":1580124743,"title":"Ask HN: 2015 MBP users, what machine have you upgraded to, or are planning to?","type":"story"},{"by":"alesdonoso","descendants":0,"id":22158330,"kids":[22158522,22158336],"score":4,"time":1580123951,"title":"Software Engineering Metrics for Managers and Team Leaders","type":"story","url":"https://scope.ink/"},{"by":"iamarsibragimov","descendants":6,"id":22158329,"kids":[22158332,22158472,22158488],"score":9,"time":1580123915,"title":"Show HN: I built a website to save you time searching for remote jobs","type":"story","url":"https://meerkad.com"},{"by":"nachtigall","descendants":77,"id":22158340,"kids":[22162421,22158873,22159364,22158967,22159062,22159528,22159066,22159487,22159791,22159103,22159058,22158911,22163979,22160332,22158884,22160567,22164543,22160381,22159065,22166817],"score":120,"time":1580124128,"title":"Postmortem of the failure of one hosting storage unit on Jan. 8, 2020","type":"story","url":"https://news.gandi.net/en/2020/01/postmortem-of-the-failure-of-one-hosting-storage-unit-at-lu-bi1-on-january-8-2020/"},{"by":"1hakr","descendants":9,"id":22158326,"kids":[22158648,22158379,22158441,22158401,22158359],"score":6,"time":1580123804,"title":"I made a website with travel advices to different destinations in the world","type":"story","url":"https://visalist.io/travel/advice"},{"by":"w3s7","descendants":0,"id":22158327,"kids":[22158338,22158463],"score":8,"time":1580123825,"title":"Netflix’s ‘The Circle’ Gets One Key Thing Right About A.I","type":"story","url":"https://onezero.medium.com/netflixs-the-circle-gets-one-key-thing-right-about-a-i-ed957b018b1e?source=rss----444d13b52878---4&gi=822f28333a3c"},{"by":"Amorymeltzer","descendants":55,"id":22158247,"kids":[22159173,22158918,22159214,22159015,22159331,22159375,22159297,22159284,22159098,22159309,22159403,22158937,22159180,22158950,22159142,22159091,22159054],"score":52,"time":1580122518,"title":"There’s No Such Thing As ‘Ethical A.I.’?","type":"story","url":"https://onezero.medium.com/theres-no-such-thing-as-ethical-a-i-38891899261d"},{"by":"ashitlerferad","descendants":49,"id":22158186,"kids":[22158277,22158587,22158309,22158576,22160106,22158932],"score":260,"time":1580121607,"title":"Wine 5.0","type":"story","url":"https://www.winehq.org/news/2020012101"},{"by":"blader_johny","descendants":66,"id":22158218,"kids":[22159016,22158996,22159832,22158715,22158744,22158956,22158769,22158609,22158981,22158654,22158487,22158419,22158980,22158579,22226496,22158834,22159182,22159071,22159023,22218590,22158496,22158756,22158901,22158514,22158816,22158637,22158781,22158519,22158738,22202802,22159111,22158517,22160898,22158581,22158553,22182831,22158895,22161332,22158540,22158507,22165423,22158588,22158766,22160727,22158600,22163883,22158357,22160504,22158880,22160026,22158439,22158515,22158583,22158757,22176239,22178009],"score":83,"text":"Would like to know how the tech community deals with bookmarks and links.

I was completely blindsided by the layoff.<p>I think there are two main things I&#x27;m having a hard time with:<p>1) Comparison: I keep comparing myself to every person on my team who wasn&#x27;t laid off - especially those who joined the company much after I did. I know I&#x27;ll never truly understand the reason I was picked over others, but I can&#x27;t help fixating on it. It is a huge blow to my self esteem. I feel like I just went through a breakup without any chance for closure.<p>2) Disorientation: I realized how dependent I was on the ecosystem. In a matter of hours my whole world was upturned - I was suddenly kicked out from a place that basically provided 3 meals, all my social contact and most of my intellectual stimulation. While I do have hobbies outside of work, being removed from place that was more familiar than my apartment feels extremely disorienting.<p>How have you dealt with being laid off in the past?

One of the reasons why I say this is because our education systems sucks and is 50 years older compared to our counterparts and teach students to consume rather than drive innovation. We are a country with highest young population. Even a small contributions of innovating work would have tremendous impact on the country&#x27;s economy. However, progress through innovation has to be cultural thing (from home or from our system) and our system lacks both and is not built produce new work but built to consume. We are one big consumer economy, our services market is one of the most influential and quite possibly the greatest progress the country has made in 70 years of independence.<p>Another problem is that if the country starts driving innovation the economics of the country would fall apart as the internal market might close down the investment and trades, why would foreign nations want other countries to consume the incomes of their people.<p>The solution to this is either India become a closed market (which was the case earlier, but didn&#x27;t fare well for the country) or become open to foreign investments and sustain on emergency supplies.<p>Q. How do the other tech people see this problem and what would leaving the country be a viable option for this?<p>Q. What are people in similar economies doing in this case eg. Russia?","time":1579701811,"title":"Ask HN: India is not a tech country and won't be anytime soon.

After graduation I did a bit of research and worked as a bartender&#x2F;waiter while going through the whole post-grad thing.<p>I eventually decided on taking a white collar job in technology. I was hired into a subsidiary of a well known CPG company as an Information Systems Specialist. When I was brought on board, I was told that I would be assisting the head of the IS department in documenting ERP customizations, developing&#x2F;optimizing SQL, and working closely with other departments in order to build customizations and automations. It sounded great.However, my boss wasn&#x27;t located in the same office as me and only spent 6 days on location &quot;training&quot; me. My &quot;training&quot; was consistently interrupted as my boss had to go put out fires multiple times per day.<p>Four weeks later I was brought in to HR and told that my boss resigned without notice and that I was to fly to the HQs the next week to do a knowledge transfer.<p>The parent company, of course, stepped in and said they would &quot;allocate resources&quot;. So far I have had little assistance from them. What little assistance I have from them, ironically, ends up being more work.<p>Now I&#x27;m drowning in work, with no one to give me priority or direction. I have politely let my new boss in the parent company know that there is too much work and that I don&#x27;t have priorities to work within and I am told that I should just say no whenever someone asks me to do something. The work I am asked to do is important and I don&#x27;t feel comfortable telling individuals high up in the subsidiary no.<p>I was given a decent raise in light of my situation. But I&#x27;m finding it increasingly difficult to deal with the stress of managing all of this. I am very seriously considering finding a new job, but am concerned that my short tenure in this position will look bad.

With DuckDuckGo more often than not I&#x27;m presented with completely irrelevant results.<p>This might be personalisation at play but an explicit search for a specific technical error message should return relevant results (if available) regardless of my search history.<p>From what I&#x27;ve read from others who made the switch  I seem to be in a minority. Most DuckDuckGo users claim that for them search results are equivalent to - or even better than - Google&#x27;s, not the least because Google&#x27;s search quality is said to have been in decline for some time now.<p>What&#x27;s the experience with DuckDuckGo among Hacker News users? Am I the only one having these issues?","time":1579614649,"title":"Ask HN: What's your experience with DuckDuckGo search quality?","type":"story"},{"by":"diehunde","descendants":6,"id":22106710,"kids":[22111294,22110571],"score":17,"time":1579613707,"title":"Why philosophers could be the ones to transform your 2020","type":"story","url":"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20200114-why-philosophers-could-be-the-ones-to-transform-your-2020"},{"by":"pndy","descendants":305,"id":22106743,"kids":[22108016,22110011,22109417,22108115,22111830,22109834,22110764,22109761,22107844,22110189,22110237,22108879,22108691,22110928,22106786,22108966,22110346,22108496,22114442,22112493,22111645,22110951,22115272,22107493,22110851,22137023,22113138,22110444,22110955,22108411,22110871,22110219,22109595,22113067,22111259,22113993,22110276,22107933,22107557,22110308,22113318,22112072,22108361,22108501,22107415,22108040],"score":419,"time":1579613876,"title":"WordPad Is Gettings Ads in Windows 10","type":"story","url":"https://winaero.com/blog/wordpad-is-gettings-ads-in-windows-10/"},{"by":"k0doque","descendants":6,"id":22106726,"kids":[22108714,22106835,22107027,22108744],"score":2,"text":"I love reading about obscure games that pushed the technical enveloppe one way or another, like alpha waves (one of the very first 3D game on console) or I robot (arcade game with shaded polygons in 1983),habitat (one of the first massively online game) or trespasser (ill fated action game that tried to push the enveloppe on so many front, from physics to AI to rendering).

The rate you pay is based on the location of the customer, rather than where you are located. In some countries elsewhere I know there to be a threshold you need to reach before you have to start paying. Additionally it seems the rules and rates keep changing.<p>My question to you is:<p><pre><code>  - Do you handle this yourself? If so, how much time does it take?\n  - Do you outsource it to a third party? If so to whom, and would you recommend them?\n  - Do you altogether ignore it, and hope you won&#x27;t be caught?\n</code></pre>\nWhen first becoming consciously aware of the need to collect the applicable taxes myself I was quite surprised to find it wasn&#x27;t something companies such as Stripe handles for you out of the box. It seems like a no-brainer service for a payment provider to handle?<p>There are services like Paddle which act as the merchant and deal with the taxes for you. Paddle comes at quite a hefty premium though (5% + 50c&#x2F;transaction – meaning if you have a subscription price of 5EUR and sell to a customer in a country where the VAT is 20% VAT, the maths end up looking like: 5 - 20% - (50c + 25c) = 3.25EUR going to you. In other words Paddle effectively costs you 15% of the sales price...). The premium might of course still be worth it given they deal with all the bureaucracy.<p>Thanks for your time and suggestions!","time":1579560598,"title":"Ask HN: VAT and sales taxes for small SaaS","type":"story"},{"by":"apsec112","descendants":4,"id":22102695,"kids":[22116346,22114389],"score":15,"time":1579560328,"title":"Big tech’s quest for human-level A.I","type":"story","url":"https://fortune.com/longform/ai-artificial-intelligence-big-tech-microsoft-alphabet-openai"},{"by":"alexellisuk","descendants":84,"id":22102656,"kids":[22103093,22103881,22104185,22103568,22103182,22104195,22103034,22103645,22103766,22103984,22104386,22103980,22103443,22102891,22103329,22103786,22103734,22103247],"score":319,"time":1579559862,"title":"Deno: JavaScript Runtime for V8 Written in Rust","type":"story","url":"https://deno.land/std/manual.md"},{"by":"mauricioc","descendants":2,"id":22102615,"kids":[22102718,22102621],"score":3,"time":1579559443,"title":"Remove Firefox Replay","type":"story","url":"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1609815"},{"by":"soperj","descendants":3,"id":22102551,"kids":[22102703,22102570],"score":4,"time":1579558738,"title":"Ozone-depleting gases might have driven extreme Arctic warming","type":"story","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00108-2"},{"by":"thisisastopsign","descendants":77,"id":22102533,"kids":[22103774,22102710,22103320,22103483,22102907,22102708,22103787,22102947,22104402,22105495,22103063,22106338,22103518,22102785,22102851,22102713,22103082,22103605],"score":251,"time":1579558596,"title":"Cello – High Level C","type":"story","url":"http://libcello.org/"},{"by":"peter_d_sherman","descendants":2,"id":22102512,"kids":[22102531,22102946],"score":3,"time":1579558429,"title":"XD Pascal Compiler – DOS, .COM Output, 16 and 32-Bit Instructions, Pascal Subset","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/vtereshkov/xdp"},{"by":"bookmtn","descendants":88,"id":22102925,"kids":[22103144,22103027,22104165,22103075,22103216,22103396,22103244,22103206,22103072,22103066,22103324,22103092,22103013,22103430,22103368,22103380],"score":146,"time":1579562865,"title":"Alan Turing’s stolen OBE, doctorate recovered in Colorado","type":"story","url":"https://www.timescall.com/2020/01/20/feds-seize-alan-turings-doctorate-and-knighthood-medal-after-they-were-offered-to-cu-boulder/"},{"by":"hggh","descendants":189,"id":22102372,"kids":[22102638,22102676,22102949,22103637,22103083,22106328,22102711,22102665,22102865,22103661,22103163,22106113,22103191,22102591,22102778,22102784,22102509,22102801,22103161,22103976,22102560,22102901,22103609,22102760,22103584,22105449,22103099,22102619,22108551,22103616,22105244,22106107,22105276,22104951,22102694,22103260],"score":395,"time":1579557041,"title":"FreeBSD is an amazing operating system","type":"story","url":"https://www.unixsheikh.com/articles/freebsd-is-an-amazing-operating-system.html"},{"by":"brudgers","descendants":17,"id":22102252,"kids":[22111506,22113554,22112270,22135250,22112637,22111715],"score":49,"time":1579555992,"title":"Emacs Tools for Screenplays (2014)","type":"story","url":"https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=browse;oldid=ScreenPlay;id=Screenplay"},{"by":"thetanab","descendants":2,"id":22102164,"kids":[22102917,22102914],"score":1,"time":1579555033,"title":"The Tanab","type":"story","url":"http://WWW.THETANAB.COM"},{"by":"cjcat2266","descendants":13,"id":22102016,"kids":[22103507,22105573,22102539,22103328,22102631],"score":213,"time":1579553637,"title":"Gamedev Tutorial: Dot Product, Rulers, and Bouncing Balls","type":"story","url":"https://www.allenchou.net/2020/01/dot-product-projection-reflection/"},{"by":"baron816","descendants":42,"id":22101928,"kids":[22102435,22102018,22103847,22102477,22103024,22102968,22103965,22104524,22103303,22103924,22127836,22102515,22113316,22103165,22102404,22104397,22106695,22113250,22102474,22102828,22105757,22103844,22102051,22103698,22102073],"score":25,"text":"I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of comments here recently from self proclaimed tech veterans talking about how they won&#x27;t even look at new technologies until they&#x27;ve had a few years to mature, or complaining about new patterns&#x2F;paradigms that put engineers enjoyment&#x2F;productivity ahead of raw compute performance.

When installing, windows “tricked me” into not getting an offline account by not offering it.<p>After noticing this, I basically wiped my SSD and reinstalled windows 10 with the internet unplugged. This allowed me to get an offline account. However, I never entered my product key and windows basically automatically linked my previous key to my computer. This means somehow windows has linked my hardware to my Microsoft account and having an offline account is pretty much voided from a privacy perspective.<p>At this point, the whole thing is creepy and I don’t know how I can trust windows anymore.

I hate this idea because when you build your own pc, you have freedom to upgrade stuff and do whatever you want without fear of voiding some warranty. But I hate telemetry more and it has pushed me over the edge to give up that for more privacy.<p>So, my question is, does Mac provide more privacy from telemetry than windows 10 education edition (the way I have installed it)?<p>I have read that you can both opt out of macs telemetry completely AND even if you are opted in, it is “anonymous” telemetry data. Meaning, while apple pulls it if you leave it on, it is not linked to you AND Apple takes extra steps to make sure it doesn’t get linked to any Apple account or user. Is all this true?<p>Basically, I am just asking someone with knowledge on this to help me make the correct decision.","time":1579455695,"title":"Windows 10 vs. Mac, what is better to avoid telemetry privacy issues?","type":"story"},{"by":"sktrdie","descendants":20,"id":22093176,"kids":[22094576,22094126,22094518,22097735,22123539,22123569],"score":121,"time":1579460476,"title":"Statecharts: A visual formalism for complex systems [pdf]","type":"story","url":"https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/271600/1-s2.0-S0167642300X00603/1-s2.0-0167642387900359/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEFMaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIHucfbZrX7uhXZ6g7sPgeMz%2FaNK8vVrrniEMDHpdj8oNAiEA6MndWhkJGxvkmaBiFCeBzAK8i6Cp3TYJ7CUjTsn8%2BZAqvQMI2%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARACGgwwNTkwMDM1NDY4NjUiDHtJBwUuEOSOkHMD3SqRA96cbj%2B8pFDILB37hoRQqXwXlDLo8cHbqg0DGazBqN3JluH39kLyJ1W2RJQoGYpX56pTvygrv4YsmAXA1XCZTAuUirLwKenI%2BIsuSvZGZhSsxj4nXfoxMdAN0QR9of4WPEUXcvHVlDAcA9w6PhSwE7JDmlnXjC1uHQv6PaTKtvDjTCN7GN2%2F5XUz6UCLJys6Eh3QS7WVur%2BsbY7j5lmSeYVu9%2B%2Bvv1OUaiNvZtDnwowqdMg8MWvmHPgaH1Jw6cnAMJ1twKOJ8pqzN1CB5oUXnca80zNXC8Ll3APvzG6f7FI2YLgaZxY%2FHlS7EMlsg460PYvobzODr7a3vRypr66OmazUfN0QjM%2BPQbx1DT4UbXX6aNwidCuDcVCnGO93PoZI52P5Xm0ayR1Utss69TsbyCIE5ASfHuSo0bhfJ69rmf2Ym5JyoFZLNVsHiM%2F0EENB53XjBVN5NTtRhwFD%2FxDym2YahTATsI6xRuCNJ67i0UMy2Aq42t8dBPXLiqIrmSircIutZu1A49SZ0l4lrKqB7VtBMNq0kvEFOusBDAkKvoIobf3FXFYCuGor2dslmz5yLUJOTxwb1331nvlXFbHzlvOUSJIWiDG5lM17hzUSHLl%2FIAM1iiWxq0nVqv4uljwXAAVeEoe787L%2BEZ8mTCdbu6aefx4r0keotVqaBRfbd7XZVKsve9eKtM9aXLBOUzxCdkhuRniZo7qsCL83oN%2FUTGSDpp4p6%2BYwNvTTWWL%2BxwV55vZ8eAKvGmmEQKwXDGORuDFjI9pNxBdLUbC%2FyquaoznQS8iKExy7wXK8Fk7lSlX7%2FJmy7ln06LKznS67jqjP8HhRDwkNT9U1PXBvirn2VuDq56TIPA%3D%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20200119T190111Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTY6PFD5VUW%2F20200119%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=738a6e6dbcba7354b3d02a0a79babfc6e9ce15f1af6820d23723ec7d54af3d25&hash=e57859694f003430965ce27a8e30172bba2e37086eb1109895ff6d2b1994196d&host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&pii=0167642387900359&tid=spdf-faed9d06-b6a0-45ae-80df-50bb31c923d9&sid=383795ee78944049719af099d4b4b2255614gxrqb&type=client"},{"by":"pseudoroot","descendants":44,"id":22092581,"kids":[22093088,22093214,22092878,22098453,22092945,22093921,22092608,22092921,22093287,22092793],"score":91,"time":1579454857,"title":"Show HN: YouTube-dl wrapper with added features to easily manage YouTube audio","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/pseudoroot/yt-audio"},{"by":"ericneil","descendants":9,"id":22092508,"kids":[22093423,22103894,22102460,22114758,22098046,22092854,22097707],"score":20,"text":"To be specific, the content is generated by a GPT-2 based model. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amzn.to&#x2F;2TCc0v2\nLet me know if you have any questions :-)","time":1579454133,"title":"Show HN: I published 100 AI generated books on Amazon","type":"story"},{"by":"frenchie4111","descendants":3,"id":22092485,"kids":[22094941,22092511],"score":3,"text":"I have a few ideas, and I want to build a few working prototypes.

I’m not a big fan of building out API endpoints over and over again for every new app, fiddling with a database, or doing lots of config.<p>What I ended up with was a syntax that lets developers tag HTML elements as containing data (i.e. objects or arrays), thereby transforming the tree structure of the DOM into a JSON tree that can be saved to the current user&#x27;s account. It took a while after that to evolve the syntax and make it easy to use.<p>I call the project Remake[0] and I’ve been working on it non-stop for the past year. After a failed Product Hunt launch[1], I kept going and managed to get my first few dozen users.<p>I live stream my progress on Twitch[2] (Thursdays and Fridays, 12pm EST) and I’m consistently able to build full CRUD web apps within hours — projects that would’ve easily taken me weeks or months before.<p>A bonus that HN might appreciate: Remake is a server-rendered framework, so the front-end library isn&#x27;t even necessary or loaded for 90% of users.

At first it was nothing suspicious and maybe 20% of the VPN servers I used were operated by M247, and these were all servers in Europe, and there were no red flags or anything suspicious to me at the time.<p>However fast forward to the present day and I notice that M247 Ltd is operating an estimated 65-85% of these VPN servers, and 90% of the USA servers are operated by them. Now they have VPN exits everywhere. All over USA, all over Europe, they have some in Asia, even Australia. The fact that so many VPN servers are using their network concerns me for a number of reasons, the first being that with all the VPN traffic flowing through their network, there is now a target on their back by government organizations, etc, what&#x27;s stopping them from putting DPI boxes on their upstream ISP, or forcing them to log all traffic?<p>The second is more concerning: What if M247 is just a front, not really a network provider at all but really an intelligence operation, created specifically so that VPN provider owners would rent servers with them so the traffic could be analyzed? I heard from some other sources that M247 has been known to conduct shady deals, etc. What if the government is offering up these servers for dirt cheap to VPN providers purposefully, and that is why they are all using them?<p>Another fishy thing that concerns me is the number of false names that M247 VPN IP addresses are registered with, previously I noticed they were all registered under the name &quot;M247 Ltd&quot; , &quot;M247 Europe SRL&quot; , &quot;M247 Miami&#x2F;Phoenix&#x2F;etc Infrastructure&quot; , but recently I notice they are registering their IP addresses under completely false names that don&#x27;t turn up any results on google, such as &quot;Ppman Services SRL&quot; , &quot;Secure Data Systems SRL&quot; , &quot;Venus Business Communications Limited&quot; , &quot;UK Web Solutions Limited&quot; , &quot;FirstClassIT Solutions&quot; , and a few others that I can&#x27;t remember at the time. These IPs all use the M247&#x27;s ASN (AS9009) , and under &quot;Organization&quot; it does say &quot;M247 Ltd&quot; , but &quot;ISP&quot; says those false names.<p>Another strange thing I noticed was that they even used &quot;Cogent Communications&quot; as one of the false names attatched to some of their IP addresses (however just like usual Organization was M247 and AS was 9009). If they are a regular legal company, how can they possibly be making up ISP names out of thin air and using them, as well as using the name of an already existing network provier, Cogent.<p>All these signs point to M247 conducting some less than kosher business, whatever that may be. I&#x27;m now very suspicious of connecting to VPN servers where the ISP is M247, for fear that they are some kind of government front&#x2F;data collection firm&#x2F;etc. Has anyone other than myself felt suspicious of M247 and thinks they are up to something? Or better yet, is there anyone who knows more about them than I do who is willing to shed some light on them?","time":1579379119,"title":"Ask HN: My Suspicion Regarding “M247 Ltd”","type":"story"},{"by":"_-___________-_","descendants":7,"id":22086763,"kids":[22089395,22090110,22100844,22088454,22090349,22086916,22087718],"score":8,"text":"Several years ago, it was possible to use Google to find up-to-date topical information even from obscure sources, using a general search query.<p>For example, you could set a Google alert for, say, &quot;embedded linux&quot; and get a wide variety of good results.

Beyond that it can be used to:<p>1. Search for and match data regardless of whether it contains typos.<p>2. Highlight and delete duplicates duplicates even if the data has mismatched text.<p>3. Calculate the percentage similarity between strings.<p>4. Extract unique values from any column based on percentage similarity.<p>5. Sum and find the average of numbers based on corresponding partial matches.<p>Because of its versatility, Flookup can be used to return the best match, the next best match, etc. until the minimum percentage similarity is reached. This feature avoids weaknesses other fuzzy matching algorithms have because it safely hands power to the user, and I believe the user is the best judge of which data is a match or not.<p>Another great feature Flookup has is that it can be used to combine lookup values. This is particularly helpful when your data has many similar strings and you want to add extra information to your lookup value in order to increase the specificity of your query.<p>Finally, Flookup is good for more than just fuzzy matching; it is the improved replacement for VLOOKUP and INDEX&#x2F;MATCH that you have been looking for.<p>Find out more by heading to <a

Are there tools meant for this? Would something like a BBS work. If so, are there good modern options?<p>We use distributed teams. We communicate using a mix of email, Slack, and Zoom. Our work involves lengthy discussions and deep dives into complex issues. This type of &#x27;deep discussion&#x27; benefits from carefully written arguments and counterarguments.<p>Emails often start fine. Someone sends a well structured, well written argument. The first few replies will be strong. But then it diverges into a mess of threads that are hard to follow. People resort to color-coding their responses in-line, etc.<p>Slack is too chatty. Other chat-based solutions are the same. I&#x27;ve never seen it work for this type of &#x27;deep discussion.&#x27; Conversations get scattered across channels and threads within channels. Maybe we&#x27;re using it wrong. To me it&#x27;s the worst way to encourage deep discussion.<p>Zoom, calls, and in-person meetings are hit or miss. The advantage is they seem to cut to the chase on simple issues. But for deep discussion, they often go nowhere. They favor speaking ability. No one prepares enough. Instead of careful thought and discussion, you get hot takes. A lot of our discussion benefits from going away to gather evidence or think more. Rarely is there a need for synced discussion. And there&#x27;s never enough time.<p>I&#x27;ve tried to find off-the-shelf solutions. A simple, old-fashioned BBS seems best. It breaks things into the right unit of discussion. It works for short- or long-form discussion. It creates a coherent timeline of discussion, etc.<p>I worry that without the bells and whistles of a modern app, getting the team to use it will be a challenge. It&#x27;ll be viewed as a stale company discussion board.

Our product builds on an Apache-licensed open source project by replacing its core component with a proprietary engine.<p>I would like to ask HN about the licensing model that we are considering. Tentatively we call it as &#x27;more open than open source products&#x27; because our product is not entirely open source, but practically it is more open than typical open source products.<p>A typical (commencial) open source product has by definition an open source repository, but its enterprise features are usually closed source. This implies that even if a user has purchased a license for the enterprise features, he&#x2F;she still cannot rebuild the product after modifying&#x2F;extending&#x2F;fixing the code in the open source repository. In fact, there is no guarantee that the same open source repository is used in building the product.<p>In our case, we provide the binary distribution of the engine and everything else so that the user can rebuild the product, including all the enterprise features. For example, a user can modify&#x2F;extend&#x2F;fix the code in the open source repository and immediately rebuild his&#x2F;her own version. If the user needs an extension to the proprietary engine (which we believe will rarely occur), we implement the extension at no charge.

However, I have been struggling with courses for years, as I don&#x27;t feel capable enough and drop them. I&#x27;m aware I sabotage myself by belittling myself, but no professional therapy nor meds have helped.<p>Plan B would be building CRUDs for the next decades to come.<p>I don&#x27;t feel I have the moral authority to call myself a professional, as I don&#x27;t have a degree yet. Even with a CS degree, I would feel I don&#x27;t really know my stuff deep enough. That very intellectual curiosity led me to taking math, but I lack the mathematical maturity. I might actually lack &quot;algorithmic maturity&quot;.<p>Development jobs that are good enough are rather scarce in Costa Rica. Recruiters just discard my CV, except for the actual jobs I&#x27;ve had (which I have quit).<p>Working in the US or in Germany (fluent in German) could be an option, but companies and authorities there expect a foreign skilled worker to have a college degree related to their job position.<p>I also considered starting a software business. But growing a profitable business idea requires an immense amount of stamina and focus (I lack both), finding customers is really hard, etc. So I discarded it.<p>Every few months I ponder about ending my life (I did actually try 15 years ago), as I never see a way forward. Depression and anxiety disorder (I have both) are indeed career destroyers: academia&#x2F;companies are wise to ignore you, as you are perceived as unreliable to endure hard tasks.

Our solution is a very horizontal process automation platform that has the potential to adapt to a lot of different industries and company sizes with the goal to automate pretty much any business process. I do 100% of coding and my co-founder does sales. Our pricing model is $10&#x2F;user&#x2F;month.<p>We started working on the product 4 months ago, and are still in the validation phase of the idea, which is showing a lot of potential, yet this hasn&#x27;t materialized into revenue &#x2F; paying customers just yet. Trying to look objectively at our progress, it seems we have accomplished a lot in 4 months: we have a working product, 5 signed pilot agreements (to start once we finish a couple of features), and we definitely get a &#x27;wow&#x27; impression when we showcase our product. Business process consultants seem to particularly see the potential of our platform.<p>We have only 8 months of runway left, and will need to raise capital to stay afloat. My questions are:<p>- Most blogs seem to suggest that in order to raise a seed round you need around $100k in ARR. How are we supposed to get anywhere near that, considering we started working on the product only 4 months ago? Even if we go through the rest of our savings, I don&#x27;t think it is likely we can hit such a number in the next 8 months.<p>- Is the advice from these blogs for startups in a later stage? How likely are we to raise money without the kind of traction these blogs talk about?<p>- What strategy would you recommend for companies in our stage? Is friends &amp; family &#x2F; business angels our only option at this point? How much would be a good amount to raise from them?

receiving and returning a lot of forms via email. When I say &quot;forms&quot;, I mean the paper-style digital forms bureaucratic organisations seem to love. Typically these are in a PDF format. Overall, filling these forms has been a painful experience. It seems that there are significant issues with the creation and compatibility of popular formats. Filling out these forms digitally is never straightforward. It is almost always easier to print them, fill them out by hand with a pen, and then scan them back in.<p>By contrast, form-filling on the web is not so bad. Web forms are simple to use, ubiquitous, relatively accessible, and rarely have major compatibility issues. Many forms can even be auto-filled with varying success. Most of us would agree that forms are more-or-less a &quot;solved problem&quot; on the web.<p>The main barrier to the usage web forms is that they need to be hosted on a website. Large, bureaucratic organisations seem to struggle with building websites and technology in general. These organisations prefer to treat their digital forms as if they are paper forms. You download the form, or receive it via email, and then you return a filled copy. The filled copy is read by human eyes, and the information is entered into &quot;the system&quot; with human fingers.<p>Why is there no web-technology-based file format for digital forms? The form can be typical HTML, CSS, and maybe even JS. Instead of hitting &quot;Submit&quot; and POSTing the form payload to a server, the user could hit &quot;Save&quot; and the file itself would be altered to contain the form payload. This concept would allow much of the existing web tech we use for forms to be re-used, and would allow organisations to build automation around their forms in a piecemeal fashion.<p>What do you think?","time":1579102522,"title":"Ask HN: Why are there no good file formats for digital forms?","type":"story"},{"by":"lelf","descendants":56,"id":22055020,"kids":[22072408,22075100,22072438,22072376,22072417,22072854,22074032,22072403,22072942,22073374,22074209,22073666,22072955,22072953],"score":250,"time":1579102147,"title":"Ways of Implementing a System Call","type":"story","url":"https://x86.lol/generic/2019/07/04/kernel-entry.html"},{"by":"liberabaci","dead":true,"id":22055075,"kids":[22055399,22055358],"score":6,"time":1579102439,"title":"More Incidious Google Nonsense.

My daily routine is not unique in anyway. Wake up, head over to the gym, shower, head back home, get the kids ready for school and leave the house for work. Standard right?<p>My Wife on the other hand works 9-5 but often the shifts are 12+ hours because of deadlines, constraints, priorities. This has really begun to bother me. I see my wife tired, mentally exhausted and almost like she&#x27;s been defeated.<p>Our children need mom and dad, want to play, explore and laugh with us. But, sometimes it&#x27;s hard to muster the energy when work has taken its toll on you all day. How unfair is that for the kids? They expect our love, attention and company, it&#x27;s so hard when they don&#x27;t get that time or emotional support.\nThis really has been eating away at me for sometime.<p>I keep hearing about work life balance but in our case work seems to control the pendulum weighing down on the work side of things more often than not.<p>So it got me thinking… Why are we subjecting ourselves to this? Why can&#x27;t we create and achieve financial freedom? I am not referring to getting rich but replace our salaries over time so we can be there for our kids. The time we have is so limited I really want to spend more of it as a family. This has motivated me to really push on, evev when things aren&#x27;t easy.<p>I&#x27;m not sure where this will lead me, but I&#x27;m determined to make this work. Coming up with ideas, validating those ideas, and making something to solve my own and others problems. I&#x27;m not sure what they will be or look like, but I&#x27;d like to program it myself and work with my wife to provide value to those who seek it.<p>This post is my initial stamp and will serve as a reminder and keep me motivated to continue on with this this task.

Sorry if HN isn&#x27;t the right place for this. Posting from a throwaway account as my main account is tied to my online identity and I&#x27;d like to keep this information private for now.<p>So, I&#x27;ve been the lead software developer for a startup for quite some time now. I love my job and the people I work with, and I&#x27;m happy to see the business growing at a faster rate than ever before. As part of my job, I spend a lot of time planning and meeting with other people (department heads, B2B partners and of course members of my own team). I&#x27;m basically the company&#x27;s &quot;point person&quot; on all things tech &#x2F; software related.<p>That leads me to my current dilemma which is that I&#x27;ve decided that I can no longer ignore an issue that I&#x27;ve dealt with for as long as I can remember: gender dysphoria. I&#x27;m so exhausted. My entire life has become work because I&#x27;ve &quot;checked out&quot; in my personal life due to the pain of having to pretend to be someone I&#x27;m not. I can barely look at a mirror anymore and I&#x27;m pretty much living my life day-by-day despite being successful in my career and everyone being so &quot;proud&quot; of me. I want to live a real life and not one where I&#x27;m pretending to be someone who appears to have their life together.<p>All that said, I&#x27;m worried about what will happen with my job. I&#x27;ll definitely be &quot;stealth&quot; for quite some time but I expect there will be a point where the people I work with will find out. My coworkers are people that have been part of my life (or several years in some cases and none of them have any idea about this. I&#x27;m afraid they&#x27;ll figure out what&#x27;s going on and honestly I can&#x27;t continue to avoid dealing with this myself.<p>So I guess my questions are:<p>1. Has anyone else been through this and how did you deal with it?\n2. How will my team and other managers perceive me as a lead if they find out?\n3. Should I stay where I am and open up to my coworkers or just cut ties with everyone and find another job where I&#x27;m starting new?<p>Thanks in advance.","time":1578954405,"title":"Ask HN: How to handle gender transition as tech lead?","type":"story"},{"by":"CrazedGeek","descendants":4,"id":22039299,"kids":[22039830,22040172],"score":22,"time":1578953593,"title":"Lawrence Lessig Sues New York Times over MIT and Jeffrey Epstein Interview","type":"story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21063873/jeffrey-epstein-lessig-nyt-defamation-lawsuit-mit-joi-ito-donations-interview"},{"by":"doener","dead":true,"id":22039294,"kids":[22039952,22039404],"score":12,"time":1578953580,"title":"Gwyneth Paltrow Is Insane and Goop Is Hurting Everyone","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z7Op0zDqvE&feature=youtu.be"},{"by":"awnird","descendants":37,"id":22039236,"kids":[22039353,22039396,22039348,22039465,22039368,22039454,22039455,22039446,22039420,22039602,22039383,22039513,22039426,22041287,22039413,22039436,22039403],"score":37,"time":1578953103,"title":"Crashes, injuries spike after Michigan boosts freeway speed limits to 75 MPH","type":"story","url":"https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/crashes-injuries-spike-after-michigan-boosts-freeway-speed-limits-75-mph"},{"by":"yang10pan","descendants":5,"id":22039117,"kids":[22039358,22048893,22039371],"score":9,"text":"Am I the only one that sometimes thinks “someone must have done&#x2F;thought about this before - this is such an inefficient use of time”?<p>I’ve had this feeling particularly working for established teams or businesses, but I imagine this may also apply to newer organisations too.<p>Have you felt this too?

With the usual caveats about accuracy, various sites attempting to track OS market share still have Windows 7 on roughly 1&#x2F;4 of all desktops with no obvious sign of accelerated migration by December 2019, which translates to hundreds of millions of active users.

HN.

I&#x27;ve seen it actively deployed to minimize the influence of coders and to dismiss their complaints or concerns about projects. This can be really annoying and sometimes has significant effects as technical advice is treated as not worth taking particularly seriously in &quot;serious&quot; business conversations.<p>2. On the flip side, it can actually be sort of useful. The absurdity of how seriously some people take themselves can become a little more evident when we&#x27;re throwing around childish terms like &quot;story points&quot; and signing our emails with goofy team names.<p>3.
