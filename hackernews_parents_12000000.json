I was contacted after that by phone saying that they didn&#x27;t realize my start date was in May ( I&#x27;m graduating and they did know this) and that I was being moved to university recruiting and that I was still being flown out for the interview. Then it sounded last that my original recruiter was still handling my application. However I feel like I&#x27;m just being told things and that it is all slipping away. Any advice? I haven&#x27;t received anything from my original recruiter since the first invitation... Panicking a bit.","time":1473823722,"title":"Recruiting process gone

They have the resources to build it, are already in a similar space, and are exploring ways to pivot the business.   However best case seems to be they say, &quot;Great, build it&quot; and I get to do something else than my usual day to day. Though most likely I&#x27;d just get an additional job. Might get a promotion&#x2F;bonus but not a substantial increase in equity&#x2F;ownership.<p>2) I pitch this to another company in the space who might be interested.<p>3) I build this out myself.  I have the technical skills to at least put together a decent MVP in 1-2 months.<p>Some other analysis:<p>1) Legally, if my current employer wanted to fight me for ownership they&#x27;d have a decent case.  My contract says they own what I invent and the idea is sufficiently close to the current lines of business that I don&#x27;t think CA moonlighting law(2870) would help me too much.  That said, the idea is a combination of concepts and I&#x27;m not sure <i>all</i> parts of it could be considered related.  I imagine it&#x27;d depend on the caselaw and the scope of &#x27;relates&#x27;.<p>2) I could build out a MVP on the side and then present it the current company as an independent project - asking, innocently, if they might be interested in acquiring it.

I come from India, where people in the IT profession are hired for peanuts.

Had a few questions for VR developers surrounding this:<p>1) Do you see mobile VR&#x2F;AR taking off?<p>2) Do you think 1-5 man teams can make successful products for VR&#x2F;AR?<p>3) If a current web developer was interested in getting started in VR, what would you recommend they learn and invest in?<p>4) Does my naive assumption have merit?","time":1473288494,"title":"Ask HN: VR the next platform?","type":"story"},{"by":"obi1kenobi","descendants":2,"id":12448453,"kids":[12448905,12449053],"score":7,"time":1473287131,"title":"No, really, the headphone jack is more useful than you think","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/07/applejack/"},{"by":"tankenmate","descendants":2,"id":12448374,"kids":[12448393,12448551],"score":2,"time":1473286532,"title":"AirAsia X flight to Malaysia ends up in Melbourne after typo","type":"story","url":"http://www.smh.com.au/business/aviation/airasia-x-flight-from-sydney-to-malaysia-ends-up-in-melbourne-after-navigational-error-20160907-gratv6.html"},{"by":"throwawaygui","descendants":4,"id":12448363,"kids":[12448486,12448399],"score":2,"text":"I&#x27;m new to desktop GUI development (web developer) and at the simplest level, I&#x27;m trying to do the following across Linux, Mac, and Windows:<p>- Overlay a transparent PNG&#x2F;SVG &amp; text label on the screen.<p>- Stay on top of everything else (as much as the OS&#x2F;window manager allows).<p>- Ideally, not interfere with user input, but I can work around this.<p>I&#x27;ve done a ton of digging on this, and these are my main takeaways:<p>- wxWidgets and TkInter do not support transparency.<p>- I&#x27;ve gotten a hack to work with GTK&#x2F;cairo on Linux, but portability of the transparency part doesn&#x27;t seem likely.<p>- Electron and friends are in the progress of supporting this sort of use-case, but that seems INSANELY resource intensive for my needs.<p>- QT and Java seem to be the only two options that even roughly support this, but I&#x27;d imagine my third requirement of not interfering with user input can only be accomplished through the respective native APIs.<p>Given that all I need is an icon and text rendered transparently on the screen, would it be overly ambitious to try to write the &quot;rendering&quot; part low-level and platform specific (X11, WinAPI, Cocoa?), and have something higher level that toggles&#x2F;abstracts the implementation (either at packaging or runtime, doesn&#x27;t matter)?

I&#x27;ve had an amateur radio licence and been active since I was a teenager - a full UK licence, not the Foundation ones that they hand out now.

I have A-levels even though I have no degree, but my A-levels aren&#x27;t in the sciences because at 16 I was convinced I wanted to be a journalist. Is it something you need to go to university and get a degree to do, or are there more vocational qualifications or apprenticeships you can do instead? As far as I can tell, the degree route would require a three-year BSc in electrical engineering or similar, followed by an MSc to specialise in the radio side of things.<p>Is this a path anyone else here has taken? What routes are there into this kind of career? It really feels like the thing I want to do to feel more challenged, more fulfilled, in order to get out of being everyone&#x27;s assistant and into a role where I actually <i>am</i> something.

A few years back we decided to work on a side project with a goal to launch it as a business. We failed. The reasons were typical - but mainly because we couldn&#x27;t execute and develop a prototype to take to customers on time. \nI learned about my shortcomings and continue to work on them. I also had a painful realization - I had overestimated my co-founder&#x27;s tech skills, aptitude, attitude, and basic understanding of what it takes to build &amp; launch a startup.<p>We decided to put the project on hold, and pursue another idea for which I have domain expertise. It also seemed more promising and d-able. We talked candidly about the lessons learned from the failed project, concerns, red flags etc. We also decided to keep our day jobs while we worked on building the prototype&#x2F; product - so we knew that it would take longer than usual.<p>Now we&#x27;ve been working on the product for over 2.5 years. And we are running into similar issues. We even outsourced some of the development - at the risk of delaying the project further. So far we&#x27;ve managed to build out 60% of the product (and validated the idea with several potential users&#x2F; customers), but I feel hopeless about completing the remaining 40%. It has been buggy&#x2F; incomplete since it was developed (some of it 1.5 yrs back). And my co-founder seems clueless. \nAfter so many missteps, I&#x27;ve stopped bouncing product ideas off him (something that co-founders naturally do). I&#x27;ve stopped depending on him to help with custom&#x2F;er demo&#x27;s, and I&#x27;m finding it harder to trust his judgement &amp; approach when it comes to solving problems.<p>I want to help him.

I recently fell in love with Elixir and am pursuing a pet project in my spare time.<p>I am the company&#x27;s first permanent dev hire - until now they&#x27;ve used freelancers to build the product.

We both agree I am not up to par with most of the output of the other seasoned devs.<p>Things I need todo: framing problems, asking the right questions, focusing on a specific repo rather than trying to be involved in all repos, and thinking creatively to create quality code.<p>But how do I create quality code, elegant solutions and fast, in the space of 1 month? Do I finish up Code Complete 2? Or do I practice my fundamental JS knowledge doing exercises?","time":1472568511,"title":"Ask HN: How do I perform given a 1 month probation

I am fearing that I might have mild depression.<p>I had suicidal thoughts a year back but after an overseas trip that is not happening anymore.

But, generic statement of be confident does not help. I know I shouldn&#x27;t compare but almost everyone I know in my age group is married or having kids.<p>I was software engineer and to a large degree still an introvert. I know how to communicate once I start talking. I literally have seen zero response from women of age 22 to 30. Many girls from matrimonial sites have also rejected me.

Life Extension has a vitamin D &amp; K product which shows a good ratio of vitamin D to vitamin K MK-4 to vitamin K MK-7.<p>If you have a magnesium deficiency (or want to ensure you don&#x27;t), the best approach to resolving it is to get one of the magnesium oil sprays (Life-Flo brand if you&#x27;re not sure), then to apply it all over like lotion (avoiding the &quot;sensitive&quot; areas, as it can sting&#x2F;burn) while orally supplementing (the glycinate&#x2F;lysine chelated form is a good one) the RDA. That is, oral supplementation of the amounts required to clear a deficiency tend to be distressing to the digestive system, and it&#x27;s highly likely enough won&#x27;t be absorbed. Going the topical route avoids the digestive system, while also creating a signal that you have enough magnesium (the body won&#x27;t really absorb magnesium through the skin if it doesn&#x27;t need more, which will result in a white film (dried salt) forming).<p>As each 8oz magnesium oil spray bottle contains 26g elemental Mg (the body has about 28g all throughout), once a bottle is finished (or a white film begins forming on the skin, implying the body isn&#x27;t absorbing any more), you can be fairly certain you no longer have a magnesium deficiency.<p>You can also get a blood test done (RBC magnesium levels or the ExaTest, however, not serum levels, as serum levels can be misleading (the body takes magnesium from the red blood cells to keep serum levels high, so OK serum levels may lead one to believe there isn&#x27;t a problem, when in fact the body desperately needs more magnesium)).<p>Many of the recommendations (on the Track My Stack page) work well, but you can also become addicted to them (or develop a tolerance, or have nasty side effects) if not taken properly (frequency and dosage). Therefore, it&#x27;s strongly recommended that one first properly research each thing (and also discuss with whoever&#x27;s relevant (Doctor?)).<p>In any event, safety issues aside, when these supplements&#x2F;nootropics work, they work well, and can often significantly alleviate or completely eliminate symptoms&#x2F;issues.<p>You can also search PubMed (&quot;site:www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pubmed INSERT_SUPP_NAME_HERE&quot;) to read through the abstracts of whatever clinical studies exist.<p>Tianeptine Sulfate is effective for many people with symptoms of depression (not sure about clinical depression), especially when they&#x27;ve failed to respond to SSRIs (while having less potential side effects&#x2F;issues).<p>Phenibut is effective for many with anxiety, but one can become addicted and&#x2F;or tolerance can form, so it&#x27;s recommended you only take 1-2g (split across 2 servings) 1-2x&#x2F;week (and that you also take fasoracetam each day).<p>Memantine is effective for OCD, but it can cause debilitating brain fog (or dissociation), so it&#x27;s recommended that you start at 2.5mg (or 5mg), then taper up in 2.5mg increments every 3-4 days until it begins working (which usually happens at around 10mg (which then sometimes needs an additional 5mg at night), but one can go as high as 20mg 2x&#x2F;day).<p>N-Acetyl Selank (or regular Selank, if you want the version that&#x27;s been around longer and has more studies implying its safety) can also help with anxiety and OCD symptoms, but you can read more about that on the Track My Stack page I linked to above.<p>You can add N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine to the fluidity&#x2F;creativity stack, but some won&#x27;t want to do that, as it mainly enhances convergent forms of thinking&#x2F;creativity (Math or problem solving of the linear, logical kind), rather than divergent thinking&#x2F;creativity.<p>There are also things like meditation, brainwave entrainment (Neuro-Programmer 3), CBT, etc.","time":1472514976,"title":"Show HN: Things that help with depression and anxiety","type":"story"},{"by":"azeirah","descendants":1,"id":12386339,"kids":[12388104,12387640,12388105],"score":8,"time":1472514505,"title":"Ted Nelson presents a working prototype version of xanadu","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72M5kcnAL-4"},{"by":"babak_ap","descendants":54,"id":12386348,"kids":[12386638,12386607,12386543,12388151,12386590,12386538,12386580,12386797,12386718,12386531,12386671],"score":156,"time":1472514587,"title":"A Sneak Peek Comparison of x264, x265, and libvpx","type":"story","url":"http://techblog.netflix.com/2016/08/a-large-scale-comparison-of-x264-x265.html"},{"by":"mmastrac","descendants":85,"id":12386310,"kids":[12393197,12391684,12391733,12393264,12392355,12393195,12392856,12393393,12392630,12392595,12393007],"score":76,"time":1472514205,"title":"The Plan to Save a Life by Head Transplant","type":"story","url":"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/09/the-audacious-plan-to-save-this-mans-life-by-transplanting-his-head/492755/?single_page=true"},{"by":"justonepost","descendants":2,"id":12386451,"kids":[12386457,12386499],"score":2,"time":1472515996,"title":"VC: Questions we get all the time","type":"story","url":"http://firstround.com/faq/?question=605"},{"by":"jseliger","dead":true,"id":12386240,"kids":[12386540,12386593,12386479],"score":19,"time":1472513244,"title":"Toxic environment for sons accused of campus sex offenses turns mothers militant","type":"story","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/08/29/toxic-environment-for-sons-accused-of-campus-sex-offenses-turns-mothers-to-militants/?utm_campaign=buffer&utm_content=buffer3ced2&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&wpisrc=nl_evening&wpmm=1"},{"by":"slyall","descendants":1,"id":12386151,"kids":[12387450,12386564],"score":40,"time":1472511991,"title":"A Docker Fork: Talk of a split is now on the table","type":"story","url":"http://thenewstack.io/docker-fork-talk-split-now-table/?hn=1"},{"by":"alanjamestokyo","descendants":5,"id":12386172,"kids":[12386705,12387630,12386218,12387785],"score":9,"text":"I&#x27;m a self-employed consultant occasionally entering into contracts with state governments that involve interacting with &quot;consumers.&quot; I&#x27;ve been advised to seek out insurance for my business since I am interacting more and more with consumers and it&#x27;s better to play things safe.<p>Does anyone have any recommendations for affordable insurance for a self-employed consultant?

Obviously, if a client doesn&#x27;t request a deleted record to be restored after a certain period of time, the record can actually be deleted (via an automated process).","time":1472462303,"title":"Ask HN: Should I let clients delete their data?","type":"story"},{"by":"ashitlerferad","descendants":30,"id":12380813,"kids":[12381264,12381853,12381578,12381223,12381904,12381477,12381179],"score":139,"time":1472461548,"title":"Advanced Deanonymization Attacks","type":"story","url":"https://www.whonix.org/blog/advanced-deanonymization-attacks"},{"by":"alexellisuk","descendants":0,"id":12380818,"kids":[12381022,12381023],"score":4,"time":1472461678,"title":"Hackaday Raspberry Pi Hive Mind","type":"story","url":"http://hackaday.com/2016/08/29/raspberry-pi-hive-mind/"},{"by":"chetangole","descendants":31,"id":12380797,"kids":[12381768,12380978,12381205,12381139,12381040,12382214,12381231,12381003,12382680,12381052,12382486,12381459,12380878,12381038],"score":97,"time":1472461107,"title":"Indian ISPs Speed Up BitTorrent by ‘Peering’ with a Torrent Site","type":"story","url":"https://torrentfreak.com/indian-isps-speed-bittorrent-peering-torrent-site-160828/"},{"by":"spencerhec","dead":true,"id":12380748,"kids":[12380916,12380753],"score":2,"text":"My name is Spencer from FLORIDA.

Or maybe the truth is that for the remote work, with so few positions opened, I will always be a bad fit, because there will always be someone who has been doing the one thing for the last 10 years, and who remembers all the APIs. The sad fact is that I haven&#x27;t even got to the moment when they ask me &quot;how much do you want to earn?&quot;.<p>So my main questions are: Should I give up my dreams about a remote work with flexible hours? Is there any better way to find an offer than using the mostly known sites like weworkremotely (with no more than 2 new positions per day) etc.? How hard is that to find a remote job company, which not interested in a 10-year-one-job-one-language programmers only?","time":1472415048,"title":"How hard is that to find a fully remote job?","type":"story"},{"by":"graffitici","descendants":1,"id":12378317,"kids":[12378398,12378396],"score":2,"text":"Hi,<p>We incorporated our startup using a fairly generic (&#x2F;boring) name, mostly due to my lack of creativity.

The whole project happen without any plan in place. microservices were created ad-hoc, when someone wanted to create something new or just migrated a part of monolith API. We end up having around 15 coupled services. The problem we are facing now are the tests. As we don&#x27;t have client libraries - project were e.g. User microService is implemented, mock its methods during unit&#x2F;functional test. Mocks are part of the project consuming this service. Integration tests are done manually on staging. Because of that if something in the given microservices changes we are unable to detect the problem (unless someone spots it on staging). It happens often as developers do not update mocks in depended projects. In future we will run integration testing in docker using endpoints not mock but first we have to migrate our build environment to support docker.<p>Few questions:<p>#1 If we writing integration testing to test flow that depends on e.g. 5-6 Microservices where this test should be stored, in the code base of the client applications or separated repo?<p>#2 Should we use client libraries that e.g. provided mocks for given microservice so if there is a change all depended projects will fail running functional tests?<p>#3 How you track releases between multiple projects, e.g. branch xxx from this website can only work with microservices that are using branch yyy?  E.g. in case you would like to rollback website to the previous release.

I have both of them installed and whenever I stick with one for a week, I feel like I miss the other one. For Example I use emacs for a week, great, enjoy using it, but I kinda miss vim. So eight day I open Vim and feel like wow, I see all the things I like it, and try, stick with it for a week and thing repeats it self, and after few days I swing back to emacs. And it is irritating because I cannot learn both things at the same time.<p>I was using vim for 3 years, liked it (except viml and configuring) a lot, and I like to throw myself out of the comfort zone so I tried Emacs because I read a lot about it. And I used it for 4 months, and now I switch between these two every one in a while. Long term Emacs seem like much better investment, it is amazing platform actually, where plugins feel like whole environments, while Vim is so much better for editing text and my flow was pretty good with iTerm2+zsh+neovim, but plugins are just like that plugins, nothing special about them (where in Emacs land you have magit, ENSIME, CIDER, CEDET). And I dipped my toes into Lisp, so Emacs is built for that. But when I want to go write some C, and get things done I go back to neovim and do it. So I am aware of good and bad sides of both editors, neither is better, philosophies behind them are different.<p><i>What are the things that made you decide and pull the trigger of one of those?</i><p>I am really picky about my tools, and people say I am config freak, but I just like to tweak things.

all.<p>I just had this strange thing happen. I went to a job interview for a Senior iOS developer, eager to learn about the projects this company might have me work on. I got there and showed them a few things I had done in the past, discussed general background questions, and then tried as hard as I could to get some details about the project itself. Their lips were sealed the whole time. I got nothing out of them other than the technologies and platforms I would be working with.<p>Is this sort of thing common in the software industry? I know that projects sometimes need to be kept secret for whatever reason, but from my perspective as a job candidate, I need to know about the content of the work before accepting a job -- Does the CEO have a vision with this product? Is this project going to succeed? Who is their designer? What sorts of prototypes have they built? etc.<p>I say this because I know from my past experiences that my enthusiasm for the job is directly correlated with the degree to which I perceive their projects will be both meaningful &amp; successful.<p>So now I am in a weird spot because I might really want to take the job, but if I were offered it tomorrow, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to take it until I get more information about the specifics of the project I would be working on. I want to make sure they have an enthusiastic employee who is eager to do the project because the vision is truly impressive. If I sign an employment contract, and the project is a lemon, I don&#x27;t want to put them through the trouble of my early exit.<p>If anyone has run into this problem and solved it, what did you do?

Are there any other big sites that uses it?\n - Price: Are the current licensing prices on Windows Server affordable for medium companies?\n - Future: does .NET have a future that we can trust looking forward 10, 12 years ahead?<p>Any feedback, experience or consideration is really appreciated and will impact our decision.","time":1471994528,"title":"Ask HN: Java or .NET for a new big enterprise system?","type":"story"},{"by":"eriknstr","descendants":1,"id":12348548,"kids":[12348591,12348608],"score":1,"time":1471994218,"title":"Row-level version control with PostgreSQL (2014)","type":"story","url":"http://blog.myitcv.org.uk/2014/02/25/row-level-version-control-with-postgresql.html"},{"by":"Schwolop","descendants":10,"id":12348485,"kids":[12350089,12349627,12350468,12349824,12349825],"score":80,"time":1471993548,"title":"Notes on Startup Engineering Management for Young Bloods (2015)","type":"story","url":"http://www.elidedbranches.com/2015/10/notes-on-startup-engineering-management.html?m=1"},{"by":"guifortaine","descendants":64,"id":12348374,"kids":[12348717,12348793,12349022,12348740,12348762,12348770,12349388,12348797,12349217,12348879,12348962,12350223,12348637,12350889,12349399,12348899,12351784,12349418,12350581,12348922,12349323,12349309,12348698,12350471,12349017],"score":167,"time":1471992166,"title":"OpenLambda, a system for serverless computing","type":"story","url":"http://www.open-lambda.org/index.htm"},{"by":"walterbell","descendants":25,"id":12348198,"kids":[12349134,12348835,12349822,12348584,12349557],"score":87,"time":1471990369,"title":"The TPP Deal Won’t Improve Our Security","type":"story","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/23/opinion/why-the-tpp-deal-wont-improve-our-security.html?_r=0"},{"by":"gsathya_hn","descendants":18,"id":12347944,"kids":[12348863,12350019,12348779,12348562,12349259],"score":71,"time":1471988537,"title":"V8: Firing Up the Ignition Interpreter","type":"story","url":"http://v8project.blogspot.com/2016/08/firing-up-ignition-interpreter.html"},{"by":"dnetesn","descendants":40,"id":12347689,"kids":[12349507,12349359,12349872,12352556,12350521,12349503,12349269,12350905],"score":54,"time":1471986774,"title":"Ang Lee Is Embracing a Faster Film Format.

The conversation went well and he asked that I reach out to him when I got closer to graduation to talk further.<p>Personal issues ended up delaying my graduation by a year and a half and now as I plan to graduate in August &#x27;17 I was wondering if too much time has passed to directly contact the recruiter.<p>Thanks guys!","time":1471894115,"title":"Ask HN: Google Recruiter contact etiquette","type":"story"},{"by":"jimsojim","descendants":19,"id":12338603,"kids":[12338811,12339639,12339504,12340922,12338813,12340087,12339189,12338796],"score":69,"time":1471892942,"title":"Sponge creates steam using ambient sunlight","type":"story","url":"http://news.mit.edu/2016/sponge-creates-steam-using-ambient-sunlight-0822"},{"by":"rch","descendants":34,"id":12338460,"kids":[12338854,12338788,12339489,12338832,12339253,12338727,12342277,12340956,12338828],"score":111,"time":1471891916,"title":"In Paris, Plans for a Seine Reinvention (2015)","type":"story","url":"http://www.citylab.com/design/2015/05/in-paris-plans-for-a-river-seine-reinvention/392639/"},{"by":"catilac","descendants":13,"id":12338449,"kids":[12349214,12339004,12339086,12339410,12339087,12339503],"score":12,"time":1471891798,"title":"With Moderate Drinking Under Fire, Alcohol Companies Go on Offensive","type":"story","url":"http://www.wsj.com/articles/with-moderate-drinking-under-fire-alcohol-companies-go-on-offensive-1471889160"},{"by":"qwertyuiop924","descendants":2,"id":12338441,"kids":[12367116,12368501],"score":4,"time":1471891705,"title":"TXR: An Original, New Programming Language for Convenient Data Munging","type":"story","url":"http://www.nongnu.org/txr/"},{"by":"joncalhoun","descendants":3,"id":12338548,"kids":[12338558,12338551],"score":3,"time":1471892584,"title":"Cost of living adjusted salaries are terrible for remote employees","type":"story","url":"http://www.calhoun.io/cost-of-living-adjusted-salaries-are-terrible-for-remote-employees/"},{"by":"ssdigi","descendants":5,"id":12338370,"kids":[12357653,12340139,12342598,12343493],"score":11,"time":1471890855,"title":"Show HN: Bingewatch tells you when a TV show has ended so you can binge watch it","type":"story","url":"http://www.bingewatchapp.com/"},{"by":"graham1776","descendants":3,"id":12338287,"kids":[12338337,12338626,12338352],"score":3,"text":"I work in an open office with about 30 people, all in the same room.

At the time I didn&#x27;t quite appreciate the extent of the issue and told him very generally that he excelled with the big picture but needed to needed to be more detail oriented. So although Rob&#x27;s team member has called him publicly I don&#x27;t think Rob even remotely realizes how poorly he stands. This startup is small (8 people) and very close knit, so I&#x27;m worried that if I simply let him go it would come out of left field and hurt the morale of the rest of the company (with the obvious exception of Rob&#x27;s disgruntled team member).<p>If the issue was simply him pushing buggy code live I would sit down and discuss the issue with Rob and make clear that this is not appropriate and needs to be changed. However the issue seems far deeper than that, and he has already lost the confidence of the best programmer on the team.<p>The only time I&#x27;ve had to deal with a poor performer was a much more cut and dry situation, so I feel a lot of uncertainty right now for such an important decision.

The initial promotion went relatively well: I posted in various facebook groups, a large mailing list I’m part of, and on r&#x2F;nootropics. (Reddit went… very typically for reddit :) There’s less of an ethos of constructive comments there than here on HN, and we tend to be more expensive than known vendors, so the responses were mixed. Still though, we got some useful feedback, and I think I didn’t handle things <i>too</i> terribly.)<p>After that we’ve sort of hit a rut though. I’m personally engaging on reddit, on our facebook page, and on facebook pages of companies that would attract people that might be in our market – but that’s slow going. We’re 4th in the search results for “nootropics”… on Bing. On Google we’re still around page 4, if that. We’re trying to reach out through our networks to get backlinks as well as exposure, we’re running some targeted Facebook ads, and we’re working on articles that would be interesting to the general public, that would organically also include information about nootropics. (For example: I recently made a reddit post on motivation that got gilded twice, I intend to turn that into a full blog post to share on places like r&#x2F;motivation or Lifehacker.)<p>But it all seems a little slow-going, and it’s unclear how much impact it’s going to have. Are we missing something obvious? Are there better things we could be doing? We’re at the point where we’re considering looking for a second investment round, just to get the funds for a bigger push – but even that seems uncertain if it’s a good idea or not.<p>Sooo… let me know what you think? Feedback not about the marketing situation is also welcome!

am looking for articles or research related to the optimization of timing the ingest of nutrients around periods of rest and exercise.<p>Basic idea is this:<p>You work out on Monday, Wednesday and Friday early AM.  Let&#x27;s say you lift for a couple of hours from 6 AM until 8 PM.<p>When should you ingest nutrients in order to optimally provide the body with what it needs to repair and grow?  What nutrient mix is necessary and in what quantities in relation to body mass?<p>It seems reasonable to assume that the body will not benefit from anything you ate 24 hours earlier, say, Sunday&#x27;s breakfast for a Monday 6:00AM workout.  How, then, should nutrition timing, mix and quantity change during rest days in order to, again, optimize for the delivery of what the body needs and not overshoot.<p>The hypothesis here is that eating the same meals every day with total disregard of the physical activity taking place does not seem sensible or optimal.<p>If you work out hard on Monday morning and will sit in front of a computer, couch, sleep for most of the 48 hours following your workout surely you don&#x27;t need nutrients at the same intensity, volume and mix as you did a few hours before and a few hours after the workout.<p>Does anyone know of literature&#x2F;research in this area.

The rulers of ‘princely states’ are to choose whether to accede to India or Pakistan. The Maharaja Hari Singh is the Hindu ruler of Muslim-majority Kashmir.\n- The Maharaja accedes control to India. The case is referred to the UN which recommends holding a referendum&#x2F;plebiscite in the region, after a ceasefire has been reached. \n- The plebiscite was never held. India maintains this is because Pakistan did not withdraw its troops from the region, as the UN resolution required. Pakistan believes that India&#x27;s claim to the land is invalid and a plebiscite should be held.\n- There are three main wars that form the conflict (1947, 1965, and 1999) and estimates of the death toll sit at around 80,000+.\n- Read more in the Wikipedia article: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kashmir_conflict<p>In tech, we often lament about how many start ups seem to be working on trivial problems (e.g. on-demand food delivery apps, web scraper&#x2F;aggregators), rather than difficult, long-standing, real world problems.

For example, rubber duck debugging (using an internal voice) seems to allow me to slow down and think through all of the reasons something can be broken, whereas writing boilerplate code seems to be the least painless when I &quot;turn off&quot; the internal monologue.<p>I hope that gathering a variety of experience can not only show the spectrum of differences but allow people to experiment with different strategies.","time":1471225862,"title":"Ask HN: What's going on in your head when you program?","type":"story"},{"by":"joubert","descendants":98,"id":12288066,"kids":[12288256,12288690,12288292,12288291,12289716,12288315,12289125,12288946,12291284,12288258,12288618,12290797,12288273,12288248,12289036,12288362,12288314,12289728,12289921,12288302],"score":121,"time":1471223658,"title":"ShiftJS – Swift to JavaScript transpiler","type":"story","url":"http://www.shiftjs.com"},{"by":"kevindeasis","descendants":9,"id":12288056,"kids":[12288138,12288173,12288180,12289062],"score":3,"time":1471223459,"title":"Ask HN: What hobbies do you have outside tech, and how do you start learning it?","type":"story"},{"by":"sohkamyung","descendants":26,"id":12288118,"kids":[12290408,12288448,12289919,12290125,12289139],"score":109,"time":1471224623,"title":"Cuban Cartoonist Fled from Castro and Created 'Spy vs. Spy'","type":"story","url":"http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/meet-the-cuban-expatriate-who-created-spy-vs-spy"},{"by":"cwn","descendants":77,"id":12288020,"kids":[12290308,12289057,12288772,12289341,12288707,12289794,12289731,12288919,12290685,12290122,12295623,12289260,12290871],"score":101,"time":1471222735,"title":"Soros, the Open Society Foundations, and the Continued Political Hacks","type":"story","url":"https://www.riskbasedsecurity.com/2016/08/soros-the-open-society-foundations-and-the-continued-political-hacks/"},{"by":"jonbaer","descendants":2,"id":12287988,"kids":[12289419,12288733],"score":6,"time":1471221842,"title":"Hyperloop and our misplaced love of futuristic technology","type":"story","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/14/hyperloop-elon-musk-futuristic-technology-transport"},{"by":"snaky","descendants":18,"id":12287841,"kids":[12289394,12288999,12289430,12288467,12290484,12288848,12288038,12288701,12289120,12289153,12288819],"score":41,"time":1471218284,"title":"Verifying copies","type":"story","url":"http://jrs-s.net/2016/06/29/verifying-copies/"},{"by":"vmorgulis","descendants":16,"id":12287816,"kids":[12288297,12288220,12292395,12288479,12288836,12288435,12288111],"score":61,"time":1471217738,"title":"IUP Portable User Interface: Multi-Platform Toolkit for Building GUI in C or Lua","type":"story","url":"http://webserver2.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/"},{"by":"dwaxe","descendants":45,"id":12287819,"kids":[12288310,12288125,12288561,12290143,12288497],"score":95,"time":1471217772,"title":"The FCC Can't Save Community Broadband, But We Can","type":"story","url":"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/08/community-broadband-and-fcc-net-neutrality-still-begins-home"},{"by":"bootload","descendants":9,"id":12287732,"kids":[12288149,12288012,12288033,12288080],"score":21,"time":1471216048,"title":"Percentage of employees working more than 50 hours per week, 2014 OECD area","type":"story","url":"https://utopiayouarestandinginit.com/2016/08/15/employees-working-more-than-50-hours-per-week-2014-opec-area/"},{"by":"hellbanTHIS","descendants":13,"id":12287685,"kids":[12289038,12289191,12289288,12290277],"score":44,"time":1471215124,"title":"The age of stream of consciousness and insanity","type":"story","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-age-of-stream-of-consciousness--and-insanity/2016/08/12/9388be82-60b4-11e6-8e45-477372e89d78_story.html?utm_term=.1452093c4570"},{"by":"rspivak","descendants":5,"id":12287669,"kids":[12288663,12288774,12287966,12288378],"score":43,"time":1471214683,"title":"The Ultimate Cheat Sheet for Reinventing Yourself","type":"story","url":"http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2013/12/the-ultimate-cheat-sheet-for-reinventing-yourself-2/"},{"by":"samsolomon","descendants":41,"id":12287576,"kids":[12287768,12287837,12288025,12287727,12288059,12288016,12288036,12287780,12288011,12287714],"score":76,"time":1471212515,"title":"In Texas, a man who didn’t kill anybody is about to be executed for murder","type":"story","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/08/12/in-texas-a-man-who-didnt-kill-anybody-is-about-to-be-executed-for-murder/?utm_term=.8a947c26d6c5"},{"by":"johnwheeler","descendants":4,"id":12287541,"kids":[12289559,12289547,12288900],"score":4,"text":"The HN content I get the most value out of is not always the content I upvote.<p>Sometimes, I&#x27;ll hit the back button in the middle of an article to altruistically upvote it, but often, I&#x27;ll upvote based on other signals even though I don&#x27;t end up reading the articles.<p>For example, I looked at my history just now.

So, I want to keep root certificate private key for 10 years, to be able to generate new intermediate certificates, just in case.<p>To be more generic, and to ask broader question:\nI want to save in safe place some data I need rarely (once a few years), but really do not want to loose under any circumstances, including natural disasters and human errors.<p>Of course, I do not ask about general backup best practices. I mean, I backup databases encrypted off-site, but I think that is different, because:<p>1) I do not have master copy. For database there is database and backup of database. For root CA certificate private key there is only backup.<p>2) Databases are generally not that sensitive, information outdates quickly. Minute resolution log of CPU load is no match to root certificate private key. Such information can be used years after it leaked.<p>3) Databases backup usually should not be kept for more than a few months. So, if my off-site storage provider goes out of business, it is not a big deal.<p>4) Restore checks are often (once a month at least), while I ask more about &quot;backup and forget for 10 years&quot; case. So I may not even be aware I lost my data until I need it.","time":1471030818,"title":"Ask HN: How do you keep highly sensitive information off-site for a long time?","type":"story"},{"by":"hoodoof","descendants":5,"id":12278238,"kids":[12278343,12281897,12278389],"score":14,"time":1471031013,"title":"Ask HN: What amazing successes started with a “Show HN”?","type":"story"},{"by":"andrest","descendants":2,"id":12278220,"kids":[12278233,12279251],"score":2,"text":"Should one clock in regular hours, are weekends and overtime expected?","time":1471030862,"title":"Ask HN: How much should I work as a first hire?","type":"story"},{"by":"pc","descendants":104,"id":12278164,"kids":[12278638,12279247,12278582,12279935,12278668,12278877,12278742,12278575,12278867,12278413,12278700,12279615,12278913,12278855,12279525,12278660,12278642,12278838,12278926,12278608],"score":85,"time":1471030330,"title":"Why some businesses aren't allowed on Stripe","type":"story","url":"https://stripe.com/blog/why-some-businesses-arent-allowed"},{"by":"pascalmemories","descendants":6,"id":12277913,"kids":[12278005,12278001,12278002],"score":17,"time":1471028016,"title":"Polls suggest Iceland's Pirate party may form next government","type":"story","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/12/polls-suggests-icelands-pirate-party-form-next-government"},{"by":"adamnemecek","descendants":32,"id":12277867,"kids":[12278028,12278197,12279323],"score":51,"time":1471027577,"title":"World Elephant Day: Why It Matters","type":"story","url":"http://time.com/4450027/world-elephant-day-why-it-matters/"},{"by":"markpapadakis","descendants":12,"id":12277847,"kids":[12279066,12278576,12278891,12278918],"score":12,"time":1471027437,"title":"Introducing Tank, a very high performance log","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@markpapadakis/introducing-tank-a-very-high-performance-log-7957ee4c4a89#.fz8tpqfjj"},{"by":"jseliger","descendants":155,"id":12277841,"kids":[12278060,12278347,12278065,12278093,12278338,12278334,12278195,12278281,12278820,12280503,12278125,12279626,12278034,12278084,12278417,12278386,12279812,12278563,12278502,12278159,12278045,12278076],"score":164,"time":1471027385,"title":"Streetfoto founder Ken Walton arrested at gunpoint","type":"story","url":"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154366414123077&set=a.43585593076.53031.641348076&type=3&theater"},{"by":"jhon-wu","descendants":2,"id":12277834,"kids":[12278264,12278581],"score":27,"time":1471027320,"title":"Needle – A modular framework to streamline security assessments of iOS apps","type":"story","url":"http://seclist.us/needle-is-an-open-source-modular-framework-to-streamline-the-process-of-conducting-security-assessments-of-ios-apps.html"},{"by":"ylhert","descendants":30,"id":12277787,"kids":[12278131,12279060,12278226,12278044,12278023,12278020,12277916,12277977,12279077,12277974,12278004,12279081,12279613,12278408,12279466,12278798],"score":66,"time":1471026951,"title":"Standup Antipatterns","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@yanismydj/standup-antipatterns-1e9db0d497da"},{"by":"edward","descendants":5,"id":12277758,"kids":[12278647,12277885,12279114],"score":30,"time":1471026703,"title":"The Internet Doesn’t Route Around Surveillance","type":"story","url":"https://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-internet-doesnt-route-around-surveillance"},{"by":"tyagis","descendants":5,"id":12277735,"kids":[12283069,12279289,12280116,12278518,12280641],"score":5,"text":"I am in my late 20s and have been skinny all my life, although none of my folks are.

So, F# can theoretically run on the server, in the browser (via Fable [1]) and on mobile (via Xamarin Studio [2]).

Herein we&#x27;ll say that we are a closed email system and just like you create an email ID elsewhere, you reserve your username here and communicate with others (using the system) just like Email but much more powerfully. The problem here is that until others are invited onto Comtify, it&#x27;s unusable and for it to compete with email, a huge critical mass of users would be needed.<p>- Another thought is to position it as a &#x27;Free Business Email&#x27;, wherein we&#x27;ll say that we are the first free provider of business email. [Herein, we&#x27;ll look at other revenue sources like charging businesses only on on-premise deployment etc.]. This would not actually be emails, but usernames on Comtify (just like Twitter handles).

We want to provide a functionality to users to change their usernames later on.<p>Now, the problem is that we cannot use FB username, FB email, Twitter username or Twitter email or the Meraki username as a constant user identity for their actions on the app because it may vary as user can change it anytime.<p>How do we or what do we choose as a User identity? Providing numbers-identity to newly signed up users doesn&#x27;t seem that attractive to us.","time":1470640998,"title":"Ask HN: How do we pick an user ID while building a social-platform?","type":"story"},{"by":"nreece","descendants":73,"id":12245932,"kids":[12246208,12246064,12246361,12246215,12246218,12246200,12246139,12246126,12246220,12246140,12252364,12246341,12246642,12246162,12246112],"score":94,"time":1470640113,"title":"Video of Valley Mogul Kicking His Girlfriend 117 Times Could Send Him to Jail","type":"story","url":"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/08/video-of-silicon-valley-mogul-kicking-his-girlfriend-117-times-could-send-him-to-jail.html"},{"by":"kushti","descendants":6,"id":12245937,"kids":[12246616,12246204],"score":32,"time":1470640135,"title":"Video surveillance recorders RIDDLED with 0-days","type":"story","url":"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/08/07/nuuo_netgear_surveillance_recorders_riddled_with_0days/"},{"by":"neilpeel","descendants":6,"id":12245913,"kids":[12246643,12247230,12246234,12247363,12246704],"score":39,"time":1470639810,"title":"Finland: The early stage nation in need of late stage money","type":"story","url":"http://www.thenordicweb.com/blog/finland-the-early-stage-nation-in-need-of-late-stage-money"},{"by":"kiyanwang","descendants":133,"id":12245909,"kids":[12249785,12247719,12248255,12248187,12246496,12246910,12246670,12248366,12246165,12249184,12247365,12248491,12246709,12246750,12246389,12247405,12246335,12248696,12249237,12246517,12246536],"score":386,"time":1470639744,"title":"Notes on Distributed Systems for Young Bloods (2013)","type":"story","url":"https://www.somethingsimilar.com/2013/01/14/notes-on-distributed-systems-for-young-bloods/"},{"by":"humlerne","descendants":2,"id":12245767,"kids":[12245787,12246516,12245780],"score":1,"text":"I had an account using DropBox Pro.\nI have changed job and do not need this anymore, but want to keep what I have and use it.\nI have earned in total 10.25 GB, by inviting various friends to use DropBox.\nI am using 8.2 GB today - there should be plenty of space left for a basic account, correct?\nBut downgrading to DropBox Basic leave me with only 7 GB and a useless account.\nDropBox amswer: &quot;when you upgrade or downgrade, the extra space you got via making referrals will be worth different values, depending on your plan.

My next project heavily relies on database and network sync, so I figured it would be a good opportunity to brush up on the basics. I&#x27;m currently trying to internalize the inner workings of a popular open-source database project (YapDatabase), but I&#x27;ve run into a significant mental block: whenever I try to visualize the flow of a concurrent program in time, I just can&#x27;t seem to keep it in my head. With single-threaded programming, things are a lot easier. Control flow is predictable and circuit-like, allowing you to draw the structure of most programs out on paper.

Tether is a dual sticker system that makes sure that you never lose your phone again by immediately alerting you if you leave your phone behind.<p>We think Tether could be a great story for ycombinator for these reasons:<p>1.\tInnovative gear – Most other products tell you where your phone is once you have lost it, meanwhile Tether pre-emptively alerts you as soon as you leave your phone behind.\n2.\tSleek design – The Tether stickers are very small and slim and look great, so you don’t have to worry about sticking them to anything!\n3.\tReliable - Unlike any other phone locator product, Tether works even when the phone is dead or broken.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, please let me know how I can make the writing process easy for your team.

Ironically, this solution does not work any more since most &quot;regular&quot; people own no PCs.<p>I guess techies have our techniques: mail, upload to Dropbox, upload to &quot;megaupload&quot;-style site, share via flickr...<p>However, for people like my mom who has no computer, just a smartphone, and no technical knowledge, it&#x27;s being a nightmare.<p>She shares pics via whatsapp which is popular within her demographic. However it compresses media, making them unsuitable for printing or viewing in a large screen. Telegram has a &quot;file&quot; mode which allows sending uncompressed pictures but it&#x27;s kind of difficult to use. If Whatsapp could send uncompressed media by default, I wouldn&#x27;t be posting this.<p>Mail is also popular though the size limitations kill it. She is used to manually send like 8 mails with 3 pictures each, which takes her half an hour, and it makes me sad.<p>Dropbox&#x2F;icloud is doable for her. The problem is that people who receive the pictures, usually older moms too, can see them on the website from their phones, but it&#x27;s not easy to transfer them to their phones &quot;camera roll&quot;<p>Using &quot;megaupload&quot;-like sites is probably a bad idea, too difficult to use and prone to questionable ads which display fake warning banners which can scare them.<p>HN, what do your moms use to share pictures?<p>- Easy to share: open photos app, select, &quot;share to&quot;, select app\n- Easy for other moms to download them to their phones, not just view them online\n- Don&#x27;t require all moms to download a new app. They usually have email and Whatsapp installed, nothing else. However they&#x27;d be open to installing apps if they solve the problem completely.\n- Multi platform, and mobile, since none of them owns a computer\n- It may have a difficult set-up process since I&#x27;d install it and configure it myself.<p>Do you know if something like this exists?<p>Thanks!<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;949&#x2F;","time":1470070708,"title":"Ask HN: How can my mom

In initial days, electronics, mechanical and software was split amoung us.  But now one of the Co-Founder has shifted to business plans and other to operations. Now I am the only one responsible for the entire mechanical, electronics and software. WHich is not my expertise and my output is very low when doing things out of my expertise.<p>2)We are working on an outdated product and technology and I am not excited about the work. I am not learning anything new. The product we are trying to develop, is there in industry for about the last 30 years and the market is already dominated by huge companies.

I passed the final interview and was told I was one of the best candidates. I was supposed to get an answer today, but it appears I&#x27;ve been ghosted.

I live by Hoboken, Jersey City, and NYC.<p>Since I&#x27;ve either been ghosted or rejected by everyone so far, I have only one choice left. I managed to pass LaunchCode, then skipped a few steps (since I already have various personal projects and a CS degree), directly into interviewing with a local company. The thing is this will be a $10 - $15&#x2F;hr internship. While I&#x27;m grateful for anything, it scares me to be at this point in time of my career looking forward to a low wage internship.<p>Everyone says there are jobs everywhere for CS graduates, but it&#x27;s been so hard for me personally to get anything.

I don&#x27;t want to be required to go to specific friends&#x27; profiles on x&#x2F;y&#x2F;z networks just to see what&#x27;s going on with them.<p>I feel that rather than this new movement improving my social networking activities, it&#x27;s just bringing them down and wasting my time. I prefer to use social networks to see what&#x27;s happening _right now_ and not what I missed two or some N days ago.<p>What true benefit is there to forcing this kind of feed on users? I&#x27;m certainly not experiencing any.","time":1469833567,"title":"Ask HN: Why are social networks all moving to “what you missed” feeds?","type":"story"},{"by":"randomname2","descendants":4,"id":12190726,"kids":[12191008,12191812,12198957],"score":12,"time":1469833612,"title":"Venezuela has a shocking new “forced labor” law","type":"story","url":"https://news.vice.com/article/venezuela-has-a-new-forced-labor-law-that-can-require-people-work-in-fields"},{"by":"dalbin","descendants":63,"id":12190641,"kids":[12191327,12191650,12191226,12192441,12191437,12191504,12191208,12191705,12191771,12192751,12191773,12192141,12191155],"score":156,"time":1469832723,"title":"Looking back on Swift 3 and ahead to Swift 4","type":"story","url":"https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160725/025676.html"},{"by":"jonbaer","descendants":1,"id":12190627,"kids":[12191760,12191759],"score":6,"time":1469832579,"title":"Announcing Meteor 1.4","type":"story","url":"http://info.meteor.com/blog/announcing-meteor-1.4"},{"by":"mightybyte","descendants":195,"id":12190562,"kids":[12190952,12190930,12191060,12192104,12191070,12190786,12190842,12192808,12190875,12196278,12193812],"score":347,"time":1469831847,"title":"A founder's perspective on 4 years with Haskell","type":"story","url":"http://baatz.io/posts/haskell-in-a-startup/"},{"by":"Osiris30","descendants":22,"id":12190537,"kids":[12191015,12191111,12190998,12191811,12190908,12191881],"score":43,"time":1469831520,"title":"Cross-Laminated Timber and the Race for Wooden Skyscrapers","type":"story","url":"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-16/the-race-for-the-wood-skyscraper-starts-here"},{"by":"ikeboy","descendants":33,"id":12190533,"kids":[12190617,12191151,12190694,12190785,12191121,12190851],"score":97,"time":1469831449,"title":"More Wrong Things I Said in Papers","type":"story","url":"http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2854"},{"by":"musicnrd","descendants":35,"id":12190498,"kids":[12191822,12192576,12191767,12194164,12195434,12193170,12192809,12209210,12194669,12192325,12191683,12192249],"score":61,"time":1469831026,"title":"Show HN: DJ in the browser","type":"story","url":"https://lukeandersen.github.io/reactor"},{"by":"tsguo3","dead":true,"id":12190380,"kids":[12190763,12190772],"score":15,"time":1469829775,"title":"Hedge Funds Love Hillary","type":"story","url":"http://www.wsj.com/articles/hedge-fund-money-48-5-million-for-hillary-clinton-19-000-for-donald-trump-1469784601"},{"by":"chadlavi","descendants":14,"id":12190274,"kids":[12190474,12190372,12190374,12190801,12190390,12190743,12190298],"score":17,"time":1469828829,"title":"Clinton campaign reportedly hacked","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/29/clinton-campaign-reportedly-breached-by-hackers/"},{"by":"monort","descendants":26,"id":12190226,"kids":[12191221,12191661,12191981,12191578,12191205,12191276,12192498,12193548],"score":55,"time":1469828348,"title":"The Melancholy of Infinite Space (1996)","type":"story","url":"http://www.geoffreylandis.com/infinite.htp"},{"by":"shovel","descendants":13,"id":12190178,"kids":[12190232,12204840,12194713,12191255,12190294,12198442,12200799,12204875,12202937,12201305,12190290,12190521],"score":11,"text":"What do you listen to when you&#x27;re working that keeps you super-focused?<p>For me, I have a few different goto sources - white noise tracks (noisli), video game soundtracks, and movie scores (esp Hans Zimmer) that I listen to on repeat.

Hacker News,<p>I would really like to get some input from the HN community on this topic I&#x27;ve been researching.<p>It&#x27;s a bit of a legend&#x2F;vague story, but I&#x27;m trying to find out whether there&#x27;s any truth to it.<p>In short: Dutch electronics technician Jan Sloot (1945-1999) supposedly invented an incredible compression technique that could potentially change the digital landscape. Investors like Tom Perkins and Dutch billionaire Marcel Boekhoorn were interested in signing a deal.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of mystery around the actual technology but what I could find was this:<p>Link: jansloot.telcomsoft.nl&#x2F;Sources-1&#x2F;More&#x2F;CaptainCosmos&#x2F;Not_Compression.htm<p>An article by a fan website that discusses the technology a little bit. Atleast, their interpretation of what the technolgy was.<p>What the article claims in summary is this: if there&#x27;s a (e.g.) 4 GB shared &#x27;magic dictionary&#x27; that exists on both clients and the only data that is transmitted is references to parts of this dictionary, massive file size reduction can be achieved  if the purpose is transmitting&#x2F;distributing the data to many parties (e.g. video streaming services like YouTube).<p>An analogy given is this: a PDF document which references fonts instead of embedding them, hence reducing the file size of the file that&#x27;s transmitted.<p>What I would like to know from you is whether there&#x27;s any potential in the above system for file size reduction and&#x2F;or whether something like this already exists today? Perhaps executed in a similar fashion by other companies?<p>Perhaps some of these concepts are used in modern compression libraries like .7z, I&#x27;m not too familiar with those so I can&#x27;t tell.<p>Long story short, I&#x27;m not experienced enough to judge the technology described but I&#x27;m curious to know your thoughts on the matter.<p>Kind regards,\nRick Lamers","time":1469628830,"title":"Compression by shared resource","type":"story"},{"by":"swyx","descendants":68,"id":12172922,"kids":[12173330,12173376,12173109,12173237,12173120,12173111,12173291,12173046,12173131,12172992,12176102,12173097,12173088],"score":54,"time":1469628944,"title":"Marissa Mayer’s Payday","type":"story","url":"http://fortune.com/2016/07/26/marissa-mayers-verizon-yahoo-pay/"},{"by":"doppp","descendants":56,"id":12172791,"kids":[12174704,12174908,12175826,12175548,12174420,12175322,12175645,12176245,12176053,12175817,12175544,12176075,12175692,12176098,12175857,12174769,12176916,12174930],"score":61,"time":1469627992,"title":"Upthere raises $77M to put a new spin on personal cloud storage","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/27/upthere-puts-a-new-spin-on-personal-cloud-storage/"},{"by":"tilt","descendants":3,"id":12172801,"kids":[12174777,12178504],"score":19,"time":1469628070,"title":"Show HN: React Jobs","type":"story","url":"https://www.react-jobs.com/"},{"by":"spking","descendants":36,"id":12172789,"kids":[12176851,12176630,12176671,12176854,12179075,12182219,12177001,12176961],"score":49,"time":1469627976,"title":"Facebook's really big plans for virtual reality","type":"story","url":"http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-facebook-virtual-reality/"},{"by":"leventkaplan","descendants":2,"id":12172606,"kids":[12172773,12172644],"score":2,"time":1469626637,"title":"Ask HN: What's the Difference Between Profit Sharing and Equity?","type":"story"},{"by":"svtrent","descendants":182,"id":12172502,"kids":[12173179,12175819,12173579,12173074,12173184,12173866,12173465,12173702,12175702,12173359,12173106,12173226,12173232,12173991,12173881,12177052,12173544,12173993,12173582],"score":140,"time":1469625917,"title":"Some Silicon Valley Tech Workers Get Home Loans with No Money Down","type":"story","url":"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-27/zero-down-on-a-2-million-house-is-no-problem-in-silicon-valley"},{"by":"felixbraun","descendants":198,"id":12172438,"kids":[12172847,12172738,12172630,12172739,12176087,12172831,12173399,12173169,12180801,12172998,12178900,12172709,12172754,12175342,12177063,12175655,12173254,12173583,12173007,12172623],"score":268,"time":1469625281,"title":"Mercedes-Benz shows off the first fully electric heavy urban transport truck","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/27/mercedes-benz-shows-off-the-first-fully-electric-heavy-urban-transport-truck/"},{"by":"wnm","descendants":40,"id":12172423,"kids":[12173143,12172846,12173774,12172807,12173448,12174559,12172880,12173215,12173077,12173746],"score":94,"time":1469625124,"title":"A Plane Just Flew Around the World Without a Single Drop of Fuel","type":"story","url":"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/solar-impulse-2-around-the-world-flight_us_5796aca1e4b01180b530065b"},{"by":"givan","dead":true,"id":12172434,"kids":[12172659,12172921,12172668],"score":7,"time":1469625231,"title":"Forget What You Heard: Jupiter Does Not Orbit the Sun","type":"story","url":"http://www.iflscience.com/space/forget-wha-you-heard-jupiter-does-not-orbit-the-sun/"},{"by":"ocoster","descendants":282,"id":12172372,"kids":[12172872,12172864,12172799,12172501,12173750,12172968,12172986,12172559,12176544,12172528,12174894,12175721,12172505,12173553,12172638,12173029,12172766,12173034,12175302,12172470,12177100,12172913,12173016,12172879,12172477,12172859,12174460,12175192,12176349,12173357,12174228,12176421,12175338,12173037,12172861,12177220,12176662,12174428,12174124,12176377,12172977],"score":334,"time":1469624604,"title":"Salary transparency at Stack Overflow","type":"story","url":"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2016/07/salary-transparency/"},{"by":"throwaway0727","descendants":231,"id":12172379,"kids":[12173810,12172492,12172877,12172974,12172519,12172543,12173096,12173251,12174301,12172614,12172897,12173387,12177420,12172542,12174271,12173048,12172553,12174472,12172523,12174298,12175651,12172625,12172728,12172905,12177228,12176975,12177872,12178292,12173197,12172805,12173689,12174079,12174681,12175592,12172530,12173613,12176483,12173530,12178047,12175148,12177796,12175009,12172930,12175680,12174389,12179021,12178138,12174492,12175433,12177877,12173474,12172627,12176860,12178573,12173733,12175967,12178136,12172752,12173463,12175000,12172632,12174680,12182847,12174206,12173533,12172485],"score":450,"text":"Anonymous person (under a nickname) sent screenshot as a proof that they managed to gain SSH access to our production server.

Also, we often discuss how programmers get paid nice salaries in comparison with most other professions. This leads me to the conclusion: I&#x27;d probably be very happy to take a 25% (or more) salary cut if I had to work 25% (or more) less. I mean, 8 hours per day is a lot and it&#x27;s very rare for me to have a fully productive day. If I moved to 6 hours per day, I&#x27;m not even sure if I&#x27;d become less productive, I&#x27;d probably just spend less time chatting at the coffee room, and have a smaller chance to get burnout. Maybe a little less productive, but the company would be saving some money with me, and if they did this to other 3 people they would be able to hire another 6h&#x2F;day programmer to balance things, maybe making the result even positive for them.<p>But, considering that no company does this, it looks like this isn&#x27;t a good idea for employers. Why? Why do companies try to squeeze all the possible juice from employees instead of the alternative where they pay a little less, require a little less, and the employee becomes much more happy?<p>And the question to the workers: wouldn&#x27;t you accept a proportional salary reduction for a proportional time-spent-inside-the-office-doing-whatever reduction?","time":1469481687,"title":"Ask HN: Why don't companies hire programmers for fewer hours per day?","type":"story"},{"by":"sohailprasad","descendants":32,"id":12161634,"kids":[12162634,12164562,12164605,12163617,12163240,12164338,12163513,12173669,12164803,12164076,12162991],"score":66,"time":1469481053,"title":"Equidate's new stock market for private tech offers in-depth data on startups","type":"story","url":"http://nytimes.com/2016/07/26/technology/making-start-ups-financial-data-free-and-open.html"},{"by":"coatta","descendants":2,"id":12161563,"kids":[12161594,12161632,12161704],"score":8,"time":1469480181,"title":"Edward Snowden Blasts Russia for DNC Hack","type":"story","url":"http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/07/25/noted-hacker-edward-snowden-has-some-thoughts-on-the-dnc-hack/"},{"by":"kushti","descendants":26,"id":12161569,"kids":[12162549,12162665,12162500,12163009,12163286,12163037,12162384,12164435,12162742],"score":271,"time":1469480253,"title":"Log Structured Merge Trees","type":"story","url":"http://www.benstopford.com/2015/02/14/log-structured-merge-trees/"},{"by":"anthotny","descendants":51,"id":12161453,"kids":[12161878,12161959,12162439,12161976,12163741,12163289,12163740],"score":123,"time":1469479167,"title":"Breast-Feeding the Microbiome","type":"story","url":"http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/breast-feeding-the-microbiome"},{"by":"reversing","descendants":4,"id":12161335,"kids":[12161415,12161582,12161413,12161355],"score":2,"text":"I&#x27;ve been racking my brain for months trying to solidify an idea for my final year project, though can&#x27;t seem to nail one that will be worthwhile in terms of how it will look on my resume and my grade.<p>I&#x27;ve looked at doing a project with open government data but the data tends to be past data which only covers a certain time period and I don&#x27;t want my project to just regurgitate information in a different way.

What are the career prospects of a dev ops engineer?","time":1469309806,"title":"Ask HN: Is it a good idea to start career as a dev ops engineer?","type":"story"},{"by":"SCAQTony","descendants":162,"id":12151004,"kids":[12151384,12151438,12151203,12151155,12152212,12151387,12151152,12151482,12151202,12151137,12151589,12151154,12152223,12151089,12151055,12151635,12151131,12151193],"score":126,"time":1469307879,"title":"Soylent CEO Could Face Criminal Charges for LA Hilltop 'Experiment'","type":"story","url":"http://la.curbed.com/2016/7/21/12245620/soylent-illegal-shipping-container-home-lincoln-heights"},{"by":"nl5887","descendants":29,"id":12150940,"kids":[12151791,12151669,12151143,12151575,12152129,12151844,12152463],"score":171,"time":1469306808,"title":"Overview of all Amazon AWS APIs","type":"story","url":"http://aws-api.info/"},{"by":"nwatson","descendants":2,"id":12150913,"kids":[12151208,12152300],"score":9,"time":1469306156,"title":"Salesforce CEO told LinkedIn he would have paid much more than Microsoft","type":"story","url":"http://www.recode.net/2016/7/23/12262588/salesforce-ceo-linkedin-sale-offer"},{"by":"ehudla","descendants":87,"id":12150812,"kids":[12157090,12156693,12156149,12156755,12155863,12158163,12156570,12155969,12156728,12156887,12157641,12156667,12156429,12157581,12155893,12157408,12155870,12155993],"score":122,"time":1469304386,"title":"Google X: Waiting for a Moonshot","type":"story","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/24/technology/they-promised-us-jet-packs-they-promised-the-bosses-profit.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=mini-moth&region=top-stories-below&WT.nav=top-stories-below"},{"by":"paulpauper","descendants":3,"id":12150796,"kids":[12150975,12151291],"score":9,"time":1469304119,"title":"35% of young adult men in America now live with their parents","type":"story","url":"http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/18/news/economy/nba-player-jeff-teague-live-with-parents/index.html"},{"by":"brandonhall","descendants":48,"id":12150764,"kids":[12151556,12151175,12151163,12151019,12151040,12151051,12150781,12151536,12150926,12151108,12151654,12151207,12151082,12151325,12151510,12151328,12151599,12151543,12151221,12151646,12151451,12150993,12151622,12151097,12151508,12151214,12151335,12151172],"score":37,"time":1469303472,"title":"What is the fastest way for a robot with superhuman capabilities to make money?","type":"story","url":"http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/48015/what-is-the-fastest-way-for-a-robot-with-superhuman-capabilities-to-make-money"},{"by":"_of","descendants":20,"id":12150765,"kids":[12151314,12151324,12151210,12151116],"score":36,"time":1469303478,"title":"Issa bill would kill a big H-1B loophole","type":"story","url":"http://www.computerworld.com/article/3098627/it-careers/issa-bill-would-kill-a-big-h-1b-loophole.html?token=%23tk.CTWNLE_nlt_computerworld_dailynews_2016-07-22&idg_eid=9a9e0438d502ca1cbeabceb62b0cc25f&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Computerworld%20First%20Look%202016-07-22&utm_term=computerworld_dailynews#tk.CW_nlt_computerworld_dailynews_2016-07-22"},{"by":"yahyaheee","descendants":2,"id":12150705,"kids":[12150766,12150810],"score":1,"text":"I am simply throwing the out to the community.

Give me examples of things that can only be done if she were in the office.<p>* Have you been in a position where you personally would be okay with an employee being a telecommuter, but a decision-maker deemed otherwise? How did you handle it?<p>* How has the policy affected your company’s ability to attract candidates?<p>* Have you hired someone for an in-the-office job, and later given permission for the individual to work from home? What happened to make the change okay?<p>* What would it take for the company to change the no-telecommuters policy, even if only for one specific position?\nFor example, “If a rock star in my field

Likewise, they&#x27;ll increase the price of your existing package every so often, with absolutely no justification.<p>I&#x27;ve tried to get clarifications from various telcos, which went about as well as one might imagine. As many other people are, I&#x27;m convinced there is corporate collusion at play here, which is reinforced by the few oligopolies running the business. Despite repeated outrage over the years (a quick Google search for Canadian telco oligopolies&#x2F;collusion will bring up tons of results), nothing has happened and things keep getting worse.<p>What resources are available to the general public to push this trend back? How would the kind people of HN address this situation in a constructive, realistic and effective manner?<p>Thank you!","time":1469126846,"title":"Ask HN: Addressing Canadian Telco Abuse of Power","type":"story"},{"by":"neg2","descendants":5,"id":12138987,"kids":[12144167,12141246,12139162],"score":12,"time":1469126176,"title":"Show HN: Redbeard.io – A powerful native iOS development framework","type":"story","url":"http://www.redbeard.io"},{"by":"ultrasaurus","descendants":38,"id":12138916,"kids":[12140289,12140563,12140241,12140875,12141972,12142411,12139615,12139612,12139633],"score":98,"time":1469125666,"title":"PagerDuty Names Jennifer Tejada CEO","type":"story","url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2016/07/21/pagerduty-names-jennifer-tejada-as-ceo/#3f9225d317dd"},{"by":"ptr","dead":true,"id":12138977,"kids":[12139513,12139300,12139361],"score":1,"time":1469126137,"title":"It's Official: Hillary Clinton Is Running Against Vladimir Putin","type":"story","url":"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/07/clinton-trump-putin-nato/492332/?single_page=true"},{"by":"ApplaudPumice","descendants":3,"id":12138715,"kids":[12138770,12138794],"score":2,"text":"Let&#x27;s invite each other to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lobste.rs","time":1469123950,"title":"Ask HN: Can you please invite me to Lobste.rs?","type":"story"},{"by":"nouney","descendants":45,"id":12138704,"kids":[12139005,12139250,12139258,12139292,12139255,12139366,12145201,12138988,12142395,12139324],"score":116,"time":1469123913,"title":"HTTPS' massive speed advantage","type":"story","url":"https://www.troyhunt.com/i-wanna-go-fast-https-massive-speed-advantage/"},{"by":"abhra","descendants":41,"id":12138689,"kids":[12138771,12142720,12139493,12142069,12140972,12141645,12142997,12142259,12141931,12142168],"score":65,"time":1469123794,"title":"Flying Aquila: Early lessons from the first full-scale test flight","type":"story","url":"https://code.facebook.com/posts/268598690180189"},{"by":"jacke","descendants":2,"id":12138746,"kids":[12149935,12149976],"score":2,"text":"Hey HN.

In the end we made a constructive attempt at trying all the libraries&#x2F;frameworks that our team could attempt in a single sprint. In the end, we tried React, Ember, Angular 2, Vue, Mithril, Cycle, Preact and Inferno.<p>We tried the latest Vue 2.0 (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vuejs&#x2F;vue&#x2F;tree&#x2F;next) and Mithril 1.0 (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lhorie&#x2F;mithril.js) betas and we had some great results from both. We also tried Preact but we had issues with some SVG namespaces not properly being rendered so we gave up. Vue and Mithril enabled us to finally use our example app on our legacy Android testing devices. The experience with Cycle and Angular 2 was about the same as React (unusable) and the latest Ember was better but the initial page load times were still terrible.<p>We thought we found our library (Vue 2) until someone found a benchmark recently that showed that there was a library out there like Preact and React called Inferno. I highly recommend reading their readme (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;trueadm&#x2F;inferno). It makes sense. We ran all our benchmarks and it not only came up quite a bit faster than both Vue 2 and Mithril 1.0, it also had a much more modular breakdown that allowed us to use our own state and router library without being tied to a framework – which was a massive win for the team.\nI have to say though, the amount of choices out there is insane. We&#x27;re just lucky we found the right library for us and our needs. We highly recommend checking out Vue 2 though for ex-Angular codebases (which some of our team came from).<p>I hope this helped!","time":1469061367,"title":"We found a JavaScript UI library that performs great on Android mobile web","type":"story"},{"by":"arturogarrido","descendants":677,"id":12133766,"kids":[12133955,12133877,12134716,12134101,12135449,12133831,12134074,12134123,12136001,12134207,12133836,12134796,12134088,12133856,12133871,12134857,12133844,12138710,12134815,12133797,12133825,12133868,12133821,12134033,12138199,12133998,12134263,12135370,12134130,12133898,12137656,12134025,12141912,12135829,12134948,12134252,12136016,12139133,12133887,12134083,12136231,12134020,12133918,12134661,12133938,12133904,12135733,12134519,12142888,12135198,12134173,12140996,12134162,12134134,12136030,12142141,12136141,12134143,12133892,12133884,12134234,12133933,12134592,12136468,12135229,12134034,12134449,12133817,12135306,12135056,12133840,12135884,12134241,12133940,12134257,12135152,12134915,12135087,12141055,12134435,12136596,12136595,12134593,12133937,12133804,12134634],"score":1851,"time":1469062348,"title":"Master Plan, Part Deux","type":"story","url":"https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux"},{"by":"reimertz","descendants":145,"id":12133670,"kids":[12134648,12134881,12134188,12133852,12133924,12135181,12135127,12135268,12136233,12134985,12136206,12134947,12134433,12134062,12136852,12135388,12136547,12135541,12134068,12133814,12137936,12135071,12134222,12143253,12134987,12134544],"score":258,"time":1469061073,"title":"The End of Microservices","type":"story","url":"http://lightstep.com/blog/the-end-of-microservices/"},{"by":"jbackus","descendants":70,"id":12133620,"kids":[12134284,12135944,12135420,12135564,12134823,12136605,12135513,12137415,12137314,12136017,12135413,12135426,12135332,12135299],"score":222,"time":1469060334,"title":"New Features in Ruby 2.4","type":"story","url":"https://blog.blockscore.com/new-features-in-ruby-2-4/"},{"by":"samblr","descendants":6,"id":12133591,"kids":[12134847,12134304,12136898],"score":12,"text":"First time I tried learning machine learning was in Andrew Ng&#x27;s mooc back in 2011.

Any people in learning-struggling wagon and how are you coping ?","time":1469059994,"title":"Ask HN: Machine learning, AI – struggling learners","type":"story"},{"by":"sea6ear","descendants":2,"id":12133549,"kids":[12133789,12134341],"score":8,"time":1469059310,"title":"Feds want 'Wolf of Wall Street' profits as part of $3.5B fraud allegation","type":"story","url":"http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/20/news/wolf-of-wall-street-malaysia-1mdb/index.html"},{"by":"morgante","descendants":9,"id":12133424,"kids":[12137173,12137037],"score":66,"time":1469057881,"title":"Performance without Compromise: React.js for TV UIs","type":"story","url":"http://techblog.netflix.com/2016/03/performance-without-compromise.html"},{"by":"craigkerstiens","descendants":43,"id":12133341,"kids":[12136395,12136172,12134045,12133756,12134054,12133916,12135728,12133781,12134142,12134984,12136829],"score":157,"time":1469057094,"title":"Unstructured Datatypes in Postgres – Hstore vs. JSON vs. JSONB","type":"story","url":"https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2016/07/14/choosing-nosql-hstore-json-jsonb/"},{"by":"Petiver","descendants":19,"id":12133200,"kids":[12155566,12156996,12157700,12163276,12158354,12155612,12155604,12155473],"score":26,"time":1469055743,"title":"It Makes No Sense to Judge Groups of People by Their Histories of Invention","type":"story","url":"http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2016/07/20/why_white_supremacists_who_defend_racism_by_tallying_numbers_of_white_inventions.html"},{"by":"dimdimdim","descendants":3,"id":12133122,"kids":[12133193,12133225,12133889],"score":1,"text":"I know that the import duty of books in US is 0% but just wanted to check if anyone has had any experience printing technical books (300 pages, 8.5x11) in China and then sell them using Amazon fulfillment? would the saving be substantial?","time":1469054941,"title":"Is it worthwhile printing Books in China and importing to USA?","type":"story"},{"by":"kiloreux","descendants":4,"id":12133013,"kids":[12133066,12135718,12133351],"score":6,"text":"From your personal experience, how does GCP compare to AWS why would you choose one and not another ?","time":1469053593,"title":"Ask HN: Can we talk about AWS vs. GCP?","type":"story"},{"by":"jseliger","descendants":22,"id":12132965,"kids":[12133728,12133143,12133308,12133137,12134466],"score":44,"time":1469053110,"title":"Car2Go Reduces Car Ownership, Transportation Research Center Finds","type":"story","url":"http://www.citylab.com/commute/2016/07/car2go-car-ownership-vmt-ghg/491825/"},{"by":"fcambus","descendants":347,"id":12132810,"kids":[12133306,12133115,12133373,12134605,12133134,12133362,12133258,12132948,12133203,12133633,12133779,12134131,12135770,12133150,12134279,12134587,12133129,12133676,12133557,12133976,12136534,12133935,12135600,12133392,12136577,12135933,12136436,12135540,12135954,12136043,12136548,12135869,12133931,12133487,12134369,12143090,12136170,12133597,12139674,12134283,12139533,12133979,12134056,12133332,12138974,12135656,12134760,12134766,12134172],"score":378,"time":1469051516,"title":"Alleged founder of world’s largest BitTorrent distribution site arrested","type":"story","url":"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/07/kickasstorrents-alleged-founder-artem-vaulin-arrested-in-poland/"},{"by":"dsri","descendants":57,"id":12132816,"kids":[12138696,12139103,12140474,12139030,12140170,12138792,12138905,12142423,12139856,12142034,12141261],"score":173,"time":1469051600,"title":"HSBC Currency Traders Got Greedy on Christmas","type":"story","url":"http://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-07-20/hsbc-currency-traders-got-greedy-on-christmas"},{"by":"lightlyused","descendants":130,"id":12132902,"kids":[12133078,12133196,12133413,12133140,12133292,12133073,12133090,12133107,12134259,12137469,12136885,12133030,12133566,12135535,12137614,12133353,12133197,12133064,12133168,12133450,12133062,12133241,12133198,12133208],"score":216,"time":1469052518,"title":"Turkish government revokes ham radio licenses","type":"story","url":"http://yaesuft817.com/wp/turkey-gouvernement-revokes-19201-ham-radio-licenses/"},{"by":"evo_9","descendants":11,"id":12132386,"kids":[12132636,12132524,12132639],"score":13,"time":1469047674,"title":"Chairman Elon's Great Leap Forward","type":"story","url":"https://mondaynote.com/chairman-elons-great-leap-forward-68f49ffde372#.55l1ayfv8"},{"by":"elt0n","descendants":20,"id":12132474,"kids":[12133050,12132574,12132916,12132868,12134496,12132638,12133094,12134596],"score":8,"text":"This is not what humans are meant to do.

It grabs and creates data sets of relevant contractors (like a construction contractor, or a manufacturing contractor, etc) and goes through them, compiling lists of emails. The Weapon could be used for other purposes too. We may commercialize it later.<p>The problem is, I had a meeting with a VC firm, and they told me about Anti-Spam laws in Canada that could be pertinent. I looked through relevant documentation and the fines are minor for unsolicited emails, but according to a mentor of ours it could damage our reputation..<p>The thing is, The Weapon could be a great tool to help us get liquidity on the supply-side of our marketplace at launch. I don&#x27;t want to take a longer, more strenuous route to liquidity, when there have been other companies like BuildZoom that have built and used similar tools to help them get liquidity (in the States). It would be a disadvantage to us to not deploy The Weapon.<p>The fines are minor, I&#x27;m not really worried about my reputation (Its comparable to when Travis Kalanick ignored San Franciscos cease &amp; desist when Uber was in its infancy), but I also don&#x27;t want to turn off potential investors who might think I&#x27;m reckless for nullifying regulations that are onerous and an impediment to our innovation.<p>I wanted to ask the community - would you deploy The Weapon, if it meant getting your startup off the ground, even if it meant risking a small fine, and your reputation with some people? I plan on always being straight forward with VCs and tell them how we used The Weapon to get to liquidity.

Allow users to control the speed that the GPS voice gives directions at. EX: Give directions X miles out from turn.<p>Sometimes the GPS will give directions to turn right, but I&#x27;m in the left lane and it&#x27;s just too far away. I end up having to either make a U-turn or have the GPS recalculate my route.<p>Literally everyone I&#x27;ve mentioned this to thinks this is a great idea. I&#x27;m not too sure about the other two.<p>2. Also, let the user change the frequency that directions are given (EX: at least every X minutes.) This would be helpful on long stretches of highway when the GPS isn&#x27;t saying anything anymore and you&#x27;re not sure if you&#x27;re going the right way anymore. (I mean, you probably are, but the fact that the GPS is no longer giving you directions is just a little bit anxiety-inducing sometimes.)<p>For web browsers:<p>3. Give users better control of deleting tabs. Right now on Chrome I have two options: close other tabs, or close tabs to the right. These are both pretty terrible in my opinion because if I want to save more than one tab it assumes that all the tabs I want to keep are grouped together. A better option would be to allow users to mark the tabs that they want to save so that when you say &quot;close other tabs,&quot; it just closes the tabs that aren&#x27;t marked. After closing the other tabs, the saved tabs automatically become unmarked.","time":1468756762,"title":"Three dumb ideas I came up with that would make my life a lot

I&#x27;m probably looking at the problem wrong - eg that a partition key in a columnar database query (eg cassandra) may be the floored lat &amp; long integers getting a column range of the lesser significant digits. But maybe there is another way of looking at the data&#x2F;problem space?","time":1468735223,"title":"How to Partitioning Data for Linear Scalability in Geospatial Queries?","type":"story"},{"by":"neuro_imager","descendants":7,"id":12109161,"kids":[12109492,12109519,12109633,12110305,12109606,12109671],"score":42,"time":1468734438,"title":"The 1 percent are parasites – debunking lies about trickle-down and capitalism","type":"story","url":"http://www.salon.com/2015/04/11/the_1_percent_are_parasites_debunking_the_lies_about_free_enterprise_trickle_down_capitalism_and_celebrity_entrepreneurs/"},{"by":"dwaxe","descendants":174,"id":12109079,"kids":[12109129,12109182,12109176,12109372,12109126,12109134,12109167,12109118,12109304,12109381,12109130,12109243,12109837,12109260,12109254,12109136,12109400,12110333,12109802,12109594,12109119,12110359,12109123,12109380],"score":224,"time":1468731613,"title":"Misfortune","type":"story","url":"https://www.tesla.com/blog/misfortune"},{"by":"lebek","descendants":39,"id":12109003,"kids":[12110527,12111213,12109508,12109475,12111944],"score":82,"time":1468728865,"title":"Algebraic patterns – Semigroup","type":"story","url":"http://philipnilsson.github.io/Badness10k/posts/2016-07-14-functional-patterns-semigroup.html"},{"by":"adamnemecek","descendants":46,"id":12108876,"kids":[12109534,12112075,12112266,12109751,12109701,12111502],"score":133,"time":1468725224,"title":"Exponential time complexity in the Swift type checker","type":"story","url":"https://www.cocoawithlove.com/blog/2016/07/12/type-checker-issues.html"},{"by":"dpflan","descendants":59,"id":12108756,"kids":[12109482,12109533,12109955,12110468,12109788,12110135,12109468,12109725],"score":60,"time":1468721754,"title":"Nepal's Ban on Production and Use of Plastic Bags Comes into Effect","type":"story","url":"https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/ban-production-use-plastic-bags-comes-effect/"},{"by":"github-cat","dead":true,"id":12108714,"kids":[12108846,12108792],"score":3,"time":1468720928,"title":"Be cautious before deciding to use ReactJS in your product","type":"story","url":"http://www.pixelstech.us/article/1468718078-Be-cautious-before-deciding-to-use-ReactJS-in-your-product"},{"by":"sanjoy_das","descendants":10,"id":12108674,"kids":[12111565,12110578,12109996,12110209,12109733],"score":57,"time":1468720092,"title":"Check Widening in LLVM","type":"story","url":"http://www.playingwithpointers.com/check-widening-in-llvm.html"},{"by":"rdl","descendants":49,"id":12108612,"kids":[12108958,12109781,12109016,12109618,12109423,12109063,12109440,12110342,12109574,12109049,12108971,12109540,12108747,12108992,12110240,12109169],"score":131,"time":1468718820,"title":"Cyberpower crushes coup","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@thegrugq/cyberpower-crushes-coup-b247f3cca780#.zhc8scqqo"},{"by":"chrisgd","descendants":10,"id":12108579,"kids":[12112091,12108647,12109100,12109905],"score":8,"text":"We already called his credit card company to dispute the charge and get a new credit card?

Red for destructive and green for confirmation is given, but what about everything else?<p>* Given the primary color, how do I select the hue, saturation, and brightness to mesh with my existing color scheme?<p>* How do I pick the text color?

Otherwise, how do I ensure it has the same intensity as other buttons in its category?<p>* Maybe the button can be toggled. What color should I make its toggle state? How do I keep it legible while making it clear that it&#x27;s not just a weirdly colored button?<p>* What color should the border be, if any?<p>...over and over again! Matters are further complicated by the fact that the user can pick their own hue for several prominent UI elements. There&#x27;s also a dark mode, which multiplies the design effort by 2. (You can&#x27;t just darken the existing colors and call it a day: many pairs of colors have to be switched in order to preserve the legibility, e.g. the color of a button background and its label.) Picking colors has become an incredible burden, forcing me to try colors over and over again until I find something that intuitively feels right. I&#x27;ve tried some algorithmic approaches (&quot;if toggled, darken by 20%&quot;), but it doesn&#x27;t give consistent results.

So I have always viewed I owned the copyright and never was going to transfer it anyway - my idea was to open source it eventually.<p>b. I eventually joined the organization as a volunteer Director of IT, but the Managing Director and I have an email trail where we discuss compensation for continued development of large projects. So I was still acting as a contractor for parts of my work. Again, no licensing or copyright questions.<p>c. Another board director, who had been subjecting everyone to workplace bullying, triggered one of volunteers to resign. He also abused the MD so much he resigned. The idea that if everyone resigned, this person might see some sense.<p>That wasn&#x27;t the case. The problem director ended up writing a glowing email thanking all of us and BTW, mentioning that now the website etc was bring ing enough revenue, he could now be paid a salary. We were trying to transition the org to a official non-profit.  So his game plan was clear.<p>d. I shut down the website and have claimed ownership of my code.  He has been threatening to sue for months, saying I was only a volunteer and yadda yadda...<p>e.

A longer term goal is to slowly build it up into a recruiting service for programmers.<p>Our tech stack is a bit broad. The core game server is written in Haskell. We use Unity3d for the visual client. Our first SDK is in JavaScript (node.js), although we&#x27;re looking forward to the community making SDKs for their favorite languages.

friend of mine recently said his ultrawide monitor was as big an improvement to him as SSDs were ~5 years ago, which really got my attention.<p>In theory it makes sense. Instead of sitting multiple monitors side-by-side with the screen space divided by bezels, you combine the screen space into one monitor. Then you curve it so all the screen space is a more consistent distance from your face. It seems like an obvious way to improve things.<p>Possible problems I can think of:<p>-Fullscreen now occupies your entire workspace instead of being segmented to a single screen<p>-Your monitor&#x27;s aspect ratio no longer matches the aspect ratio of most online videos (16:9), causing pillarboxing<p>-All your screen space is contiguous, so you can&#x27;t let the limits of the screens manage your programs&#x27; window size for you anymore. You need to manage it manually, shaping and sizing the various windows to fit in the way you want them to. This could get annoying if you have to repeat this step often<p>-The ultrawide 3440x1440 has 400 fewer horizontal pixels than most dual monitor setups. I&#x27;m not sure, but this might be a limiting factor with certain combinations of IDE&#x2F;terminal&#x2F;vim&#x2F;etc. Two-column ultrawide might not fit those as easily as 2x 1920x1080, and three-column ultrawide might be infeasible.<p>My current setup is a MBP on a stand connected to a 27&quot; 16:9, so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m accustomed to. Currently considering this:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Dell-U3415W-UltraSharp-34-inch-Curved&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B00R420VAG&#x2F;<p>But there are also popular offerings in this category from Samsung, LG, Acer, etc.<p>If you&#x27;ve made the switch, or tried to, I&#x27;d love to hear what you think about these new ultrawides. Specifically what impact it had on your productivity as a developer, how you make use of the available screen space, and how much difficulty you had getting used to it (as compared to a typical 2-monitor, or laptop stand + 1 monitor setup).","time":1467491504,"title":"Ask HN: What do you think about the new curved ultrawide (21:9) monitors?","type":"story"},{"by":"cm2187","descendants":42,"id":12023635,"kids":[12024068,12023904,12023877,12027433,12023903],"score":69,"time":1467489867,"title":"Bidding war with Salesforce drove up Microsoft’s LinkedIn bill","type":"story","url":"https://next.ft.com/content/c741d6bc-3fdc-11e6-8716-a4a71e8140b0"},{"by":"okket","descendants":86,"id":12023632,"kids":[12024085,12024061,12023855,12024639,12024619,12023969,12023861,12024038,12025277,12026775,12025452,12025597,12024895],"score":85,"time":1467489851,"title":"The “Internet of Things” Needs a Fix","type":"story","url":"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-internet-of-things-needs-a-fix/"},{"by":"nadav256","descendants":56,"id":12023618,"kids":[12023921,12024030,12024315,12023780,12023827,12023900,12024349],"score":99,"time":1467489504,"title":"Elie Wiesel, Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and Holocaust Survivor, Dies at 87","type":"story","url":"http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.575072"},{"by":"Gallad23","descendants":5,"id":12023576,"kids":[12024227,12023695,12023758,12023691,12024804],"score":2,"text":"Hello people, I am working on an Idea and I want to validate it.

Recently it became so soul crushing that I decided to start applying to other jobs. I did 3 interviews and got 2 offers. I declined one offer because the job was similar to the one I hate now, but I accepted the other offer because it&#x27;s exactly what I think I want to do, and the pay and company are amazing. My only fear is that I feel under qualified for the position. My thinking is that I should just go for it, and that I will learn it. I don&#x27;t really know what they expect me to know, but I just feel that it&#x27;s more than I do know. I interviewed with half the office over 2 days and they wanted me to start ASAP. Part of me says, you might as well try this because if you&#x27;re still at your current job in a year you&#x27;re going to be depressed - and part of me says, you&#x27;re a fraud for accepting this job, and they will figure you out and fire you - and part of me says, you will fuck up in the beginning but if they work with you, maybe you will stay and do well.

Ray Jennings, who allegedly killed an 18-year-old girl in a parking lot. The evidence didn&#x27;t persuade me, so my dad and I started our own investigation.<p>We wrote a 34-page letter to the DA&#x27;s office, which you can read here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ehrlichfirm.com&#x2F;criminal-cases&#x2F;raymond-lee-jennings-case.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ehrlichfirm.com&#x2F;criminal-cases&#x2F;raymond-lee-jennin...</a>\nThe letter persuaded them to reopen the murder investigation.<p>Last week, after 11 years behind bars, Ray walked out of court a free man. But he was released onto the street with no resources. Do any of the great minds at HN have any ideas about how I can help him get money for housing, food, and clothes?<p>The most obvious answer is litigation. And in a year or two, Ray will probably receive some compensation from the State. Unfortunately, there&#x27;s no way to access those funds in time to cover his immediate expenses.<p>In the future, Ray also may be able to earn some income talking about his story. Unfortunately, the charges against him won&#x27;t be formally dismissed for another 2 months, and until then he is understandably reticent about speaking publicly.<p>I have set up a GoFundMe campaign. It did well, but momentum has stalled.

Their X2 cards (amongst the affected) were offered for sale as late as March 2015.<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;x2migration.eyefi.com&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;articles&#x2F;216741158","time":1467291873,"title":"Open letter to Eye-Fi","type":"story"},{"by":"brahmwg","descendants":146,"id":12008024,"kids":[12008673,12008280,12008561,12009068,12011263,12008229,12008291,12008209,12008111,12008281,12008678,12008757,12012004,12008252,12009899,12009638,12010213,12013875,12008239,12008823,12009241,12008969,12009676,12010229,12008758],"score":326,"time":1467289848,"title":"Ways to maximize your cognitive potential","type":"story","url":"http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/you-can-increase-your-intelligence-5-ways-to-maximize-your-cognitive-potential/"},{"by":"enkiv2","descendants":28,"id":12008020,"kids":[12014249,12014230,12015433,12015046,12014345,12011378,12014719,12014547],"score":84,"time":1467289789,"title":"Waiting for Gödel","type":"story","url":"http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/waiting-for-godel"},{"by":"marktangotango","descendants":6,"id":12008005,"kids":[12009666,12009205,12008128],"score":5,"text":"I&#x27;ve spent about the past 6 months or so working on what I think of as &#x27;database as a service&#x27;.

One of the things I&#x27;m going for is a completely in browser development experience, so there&#x27;s nothing to install, the user simply uses the UI to create and edit queries and admin their database. One of the most basic uses would be posting form data from a static HTML page:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lite-engine.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;post_form.html<p>I&#x27;ve posted it here before and didn&#x27;t get much feed back. So I&#x27;ve deferred implementing any more features and wrote a bunch of documentation and blog posts. Kind reader, how would you characterize a service like this? Is Sqlite a deal breaker? Would a different database implementation be more appealing? Are there any other features that would improve the appeal of the service (ie static file hosting)?","time":1467289601,"title":"Show HN: MVP done, now
