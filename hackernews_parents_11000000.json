We ended up putting it on hold due to time constraints, however the beta version of the application worked at a fairly sophisticated level (I will probably deploy from the old repo if we see enough support. backend is scala, frontend is angular, we use R and python as well and also have a separate crawler we use to find new content).<p>These are not simple, old-school word clouds that utilize word density (which have been around for decades). We ended up downloading millions of song lyrics, political speeches, blogs, web pages and more - we wrote scripts to process and analyze the data for every single piece of content we downloaded. We used this data as part of our API that generates descriptions for new content. We also take the content creator&#x2F;publisher into great consideration, and we can generate descriptions for authors&#x2F;actors&#x2F;musicians&#x2F;politicians&#x2F;websites if we have more than one document associated with them.<p>We also realized that all content can be connected in webs around the descriptive clouds - it was a very new, fun and &quot;un google&quot; way of browsing content and bubbling up other things I&#x27;d be interested in - especially movies and songs. I ended up discovering tons of obscure songs and movies that I now love. I know other people would like it too.<p>This isn&#x27;t a project that lost steam - it started as a hackathon, we all had a great time and every time we meet up we say &quot;that was a really cool

Ecommerce owners should not spend their time&#x2F;money building and training a bot.<p>Solution: We will provide ecommerce owners a platform where they can get their own support bot up and running with a few clicks. Our service will connect to their ecommerce solution, gather the necessary data, learn their FAQs and with all these information the bot will try to answer customers questions. As more ecommerce companies join the platform and more questions are asked, the bots will become smarter.<p>Who are we? I am Guillermo, a Software Engineer with over 10 yrs of experience working for big companies and started a handful of startups. I have a successful bot running on Slack and the lessons learned there will help me build this platform. Angeli, my wife, has been a PM in the software industry for over 5 years.

Bonus points if the book is relatively newer and touches on ES5&#x2F;ES6 and maybe ES7.<p>Any help is greatly appreciated.","time":1460571659,"title":"Ask HN: How do I learn JavaScript after using it for years","type":"story"},{"by":"usman-m","descendants":7,"id":11490799,"kids":[11490897,11490927,11491175,11491879],"score":24,"time":1460571568,"title":"ContinuouSQL Triggers","type":"story","url":"https://www.pipelinedb.com/blog/continuousql-triggers"},{"by":"_nh_","descendants":2,"id":11490903,"kids":[11491008,11490969],"score":5,"time":1460572252,"title":"Show HN: A Visual Intro to Algorithms (forked from Cormen's/KhanAcademy Course)","type":"story","url":"https://www.educative.io/collection/10370001/760001"},{"by":"jayzalowitz","descendants":3,"id":11490756,"kids":[11494021,11492500,11491365],"score":8,"time":1460571357,"title":"Ask YC: Release a founders “starting-up understanding” template that has cliffs?","type":"story"},{"by":"erikwiffin","descendants":3,"id":11490529,"kids":[11494425,11491115,11490884],"score":6,"time":1460570093,"title":"The status of the biggest API in healthcare","type":"story","url":"http://rockhealth.com/an-update-on-the-biggest-api-in-healthcare-share-your-feedback/"},{"by":"tablet","descendants":2,"id":11490658,"kids":[11491001,11490772],"score":1,"time":1460570762,"title":"Ask HN: How you decide when to fire a person?","type":"story"},{"by":"trimbo","descendants":193,"id":11490733,"kids":[11491029,11491045,11491020,11490851,11491085,11492414,11490880,11491030,11491484,11497945,11492567,11492348,11491661,11491501,11494861,11491173,11490990,11491038,11497790,11493288,11492309,11493829,11497105,11491140,11492249,11491635,11491584],"score":260,"time":1460571227,"title":"Regulators Propose Banning Theranos Founder from Blood Testing","type":"story","url":"http://www.wsj.com/articles/regulators-propose-banning-theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes-for-at-least-two-years-1460570869"},{"by":"sama","descendants":386,"id":11490188,"kids":[11491504,11493219,11492303,11490750,11491237,11490715,11492867,11491186,11490830,11490377,11490691,11490926,11494120,11490716,11490427,11490740,11490405,11491608,11490717,11491212,11491719,11491531,11492075,11491786,11491003,11494043,11490782,11490249,11491054,11491849,11491018,11492319,11493514,11490915,11491070,11491532,11494192,11490550,11492577,11490904,11491316,11493870,11491551,11494379,11491928,11494602,11494515,11492960,11490408,11492404,11492585,11490967,11492122,11490713,11490453,11490753,11493688,11493716,11493853,11490867,11490537,11491550,11492372,11490871,11491000,11491633,11490780,11490577],"score":580,"time":1460568087,"title":"Cruise","type":"story","url":"http://blog.samaltman.com/cruise"},{"by":"lettergram","descendants":3,"id":11490218,"kids":[11500511,11492123],"score":4,"text":"I would like to make an automated undergraduate advisor to improve: undergraduate advising, teacher feedback, registration, and diploma management.<p>My first prototype: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;easy-a.net&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;easy-a.net&#x2F;</a><p>We&#x27;ve had 670 users join in the last 3 weeks.<p>Problem:<p>If anyone has attended a university you know how challenging it can be navigate getting a degree. There are supposed to be advisors who help you, mentors, fellow students, etc. However, more often than not, you end up missing a class here or there, or take an <i>unnecessarily</i> difficult semester.<p>I went to the University of Illinois Urbana-Champain (UIUC) for a Computer Science degree and we had one undergraduate advisor for over 1200 students. The advisor was great, but he easily worked 12 hours a day, and you had to force yourself in to see him. Even then, he couldn&#x27;t answer many questions because he simply didn&#x27;t know everything.<p>Solution:<p>My last semester at UIUC our UIUC advisor I was trying to find an interesting way to teach people about FOIA requests[1]. So I decided to make Easy A (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;easy-a.net&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;easy-a.net&#x2F;</a>)! I FOIA requested the university, and was able to build a website that displayed grade distributions, but also <i>and much more interestingly</i> predict future grades. Then, with users adding a little more information, I was able to predict the estimated workload[2].<p>The current goal is to partner with the university (as opposed to Koofers or RateMyProfessor), in order to create a more streamline solution to undergraduate advising, teacher feedback, registration, and diploma management.<p>Importantly, this would benefits to the university because it reduces dropout rate, and improves student throughput. Similarly, students are happier with better grades, an improved registration process, and diploma management.<p>[1] <a

A health database where we can finally connect our health records together. In the health industry, every healthcare facilities, hospitals, and health record companies all do their own database to store patient&#x27;s health record. This creates a problem where if you were to go to see a new doctor or check into a new hospital, they will never have any record of you. You would have to experience questionnaire paperwork about your medical history. Clearly no one remember every detail about their past medical experience or medications and so much time is wasted while you are ill. With a centralized health database, wherever you go, any physicians can be able to obtain your information.<p>That&#x27;s from a patient’s perspective, but for doctors and hospitals it gives easy accessibility to work with other doctors. Physicians can be update what past medications you have taken and what works. Hospitals can know what kind of patient they are dealing with when a new patient enters their facility.  We will also provide the necessary security to protect the patient’s data. By being a centralized health database, doctors be doctors and hospitals can spend less on IT instead of become a tech company.<p>Health starts with us. It&#x27;s been long enough where we have let the health industry try to mold itself into the digital age, but the health industry is having a hard time to adapt to today&#x27;s technology.

The personal computing industry have moved a lot since. The GUI revolution triggered by the mouse, touch screen interfaces triggered by the iDevices, the VR&#x2F;AR &amp; gesture&#x2F;voice based interfaces of today and so on.

The resulting stream of text isn&#x27;t pretty and doesn&#x27;t convey well even to a fellow coder.<p>In Codeflow, you program by wiring independent modules on a visual canvas. The Input interface of each module is visual and therefore self-documented. We invented a completely visual expression language to connect the pieces together. As a side effect, the &#x27;code&#x27; will always looks like your brainstorming diagram.<p>Think of a modules as a mobile app. The same way you don&#x27;t read a manual to operate so many mobile apps, you don&#x27;t need a manual to figure out the configuration for individual modules, be it querying a mongo db or setting up an http listener. You definitely need an understanding of the concepts of every component, but you don&#x27;t ever need to learn the syntax or read docs for interfacing with the component.<p>It wasn&#x27;t easy, we almost took three years developing it but we believe we have achieved what we dreamed of.

The interviews I’ve been to mostly amount to whiteboard&#x2F;brainteaser sessions that I am profusely bad at, or CS test questions (I never finished college). Some were completely “culture fit” type interviews where I thought I did very well. The feedback I’ve gotten is that I’m proficient technically but wouldn’t “fit their culture” or that they’re “moving forward with other candidates”.

I’ve worked on different platforms as the need arose. I’ve even led small teams. None of this has gotten me anywhere because I am not a 10x top 1% engineer who loves whiteboard coding sessions and brainteasers and wants to change the world by working 80 hours a week, rather a (slightly above) average one who can get things done in an editor and just wants to earn a living doing what I’m good at.<p>Everyone likes to say that you aren’t your job.

Over the last decade 14 states have deregulated utilities so consumers get a choice of suppliers. Power comes from the same place, down the same lines, on the same bill, but a wholesale supplier can buy from the utility at low prices and markup the price to the consumer.<p>The problem is the consumer must then search for the best price, decide how long to commit, figure out if the fees are worth it, is the energy green enough, will the rate be better next month etc. It gets complicated fast. They must also remember to switch before the term ends to avoid sticker shock as the rate spikes at expiry. No wonder only half of eligible consumers switch from their incumbent supplier—the system is biased towards big energy.<p>Utiliz fixes all this. Customers simply send us a picture of their bill and we take it from there. We track the market daily, find the best plans and times to switch our customers’ suppliers, and do so automatically as often as needed. As the best plans are short term we can save customers a lot of money through frequent switching, something that would be difficult, time-consuming and annoying to do themselves. We work transparently in the background; our customers never have to think about where they’re getting their electricity and have peace of mind knowing they’re always on the best plan. As our user base grows we’ll be able to negotiate even better rates with suppliers and pass all of the savings on ensuring our users stay with us.<p>Unlike traditional energy brokers we’ll never take money from a power company or add a spread over supplier prices. We’ll be paid a transparent, fair, flat annual fee by our customers.<p>The opportunity is huge: potential customers include all retail electricity consumers in deregulated states.

Despite hard work and extravagant spending, Korea ranks just 15 of 20 on IELTS scores.<p>ESL education fails in Asia because the learning materials are written by Romance language speakers. They mistakenly assume Romance language equivalencies are universal (this is also a reason for the failure of machine translations). The world&#x27;s majority of ESL learners face obstacles that are too numerous to list here. Shockingly, these issues are not addressed by educators simply because they do not know any better.<p>Exception: founder Michael Kelley taught ESL overseas while teaching himself Korean. In his spare time he became an award-winning indie developer. Upon returning home he pioneered and taught game development courses at University and is a publishing author on the subject. He currently works to realize the full potential of the video game medium and use it to do some good!<p>As a result we have a unique understanding of the aforementioned obstacles and an ability to create a far greater level of engagement and immersion than has ever been possible. Nothing does engagement and immersion better than video games. Not coincidentally, engagement and immersion are the hallmarks of a successful language learning curriculum.<p>There&#x27;s a global need for greater communication and understanding. The VR gamification of (ESL) education can and will cure societal ills, empowering a new generation as never before. Nickel City Pixels will help to make it so!","time":1460476122,"title":"Apply HN: VR ESL MMORPG – VR Video Games in Education","type":"story"},{"by":"RKoutnik","descendants":2,"id":11480560,"kids":[11480871,11483595],"score":49,"time":1460475898,"title":"Hacking Calculords","type":"story","url":"https://rkoutnik.com/2016/04/06/Hacking-Calculords.html"},{"by":"jseliger","descendants":8,"id":11480567,"kids":[11481070,11481738,11480960],"score":24,"time":1460475947,"title":"Singapore’s Midlife Crisis","type":"story","url":"http://city-journal.org/html/singapore%E2%80%99s-midlife-crisis-14311.html"},{"by":"narsil","descendants":32,"id":11480504,"kids":[11480579,11483062,11482378,11483127,11481894,11484793,11483549,11482409,11481089,11481735,11482309,11480823],"score":44,"time":1460475578,"title":"Cloudcraft Pro","type":"story","url":"https://cloudcraft.co/pricing"},{"by":"neurobuddha","descendants":31,"id":11480270,"kids":[11480542,11480697,11480508,11480591,11480613,11480634,11480701,11480616,11480480,11480479],"score":33,"time":1460474154,"title":"Bernie Sanders is now calling for a nationwide ban on fracking","type":"story","url":"http://inhabitat.com/bernie-sanders-is-now-calling-for-a-nationwide-ban-on-fracking/"},{"by":"Amorymeltzer","descendants":2,"id":11480224,"kids":[11481021,11480865],"score":21,"time":1460473929,"title":"Charlie Munger warns about American finance","type":"story","url":"http://uk.businessinsider.com/charlie-munger-warns-about-american-finance-2016-4?r=US&IR=T"},{"by":"dudul","descendants":5,"id":11480205,"kids":[11480456,11480427,11481266,11480924],"score":15,"time":1460473808,"title":"Just Delete Me","type":"story","url":"http://justdelete.me/"},{"by":"ptoomey3","descendants":23,"id":11479974,"kids":[11480499,11480594,11480722,11483547,11482395,11480848],"score":165,"time":1460472213,"title":"GitHub's Content Security Policy journey","type":"story","url":"http://githubengineering.com/githubs-csp-journey/"},{"by":"josep2","descendants":82,"id":11479958,"kids":[11481358,11480168,11480262,11480414,11480317,11481049,11481263,11480900,11480211,11480175,11480243,11481100,11480956,11480428,11481078,11483025,11482283,11481132,11480332,11484989,11480958,11484910,11485999,11480737,11482371,11480255,11495107,11480488,11480724,11480232,11480251,11480074,11481112],"score":77,"time":1460472116,"title":"Semicolons matter","type":"story","url":"http://blog.rrowland.com/2016/04/11/semicolons-do-matter/"},{"by":"rlt3","descendants":93,"id":11479927,"kids":[11480261,11481195,11480231,11480416,11480503,11481416,11481348,11481988,11482207,11480220,11480376,11480509,11480513,11480672,11480538,11481617,11480896,11480411,11481918,11482460,11480533],"score":87,"time":1460471859,"title":"A Healthy Hatred of OOP, or the principles of my message-driven framework","type":"story","url":"https://bythehilt.com/articles/dialogues-guiding-principles-or-a-healthy-hatred-of-oop"},{"by":"wanderer42","descendants":8,"id":11479900,"kids":[11482243,11481801,11485913,11480750,11481753],"score":81,"time":1460471697,"title":"NASA has recovered the Kepler Space Telescope from 'emergency mode'","type":"story","url":"http://www.theverge.com/2016/4/11/11408620/nasa-kepler-telescope-emergency-mode-stable"},{"by":"uptown","descendants":7,"id":11479855,"kids":[11479916,11480312],"score":4,"time":1460471351,"title":"Hotel: local .dev domains for everyone","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/typicode/hotel"},{"by":"aardvarks","descendants":61,"id":11479857,"kids":[11480252,11484420,11482575,11480771,11480892,11482169,11482434,11494334,11482775,11483031,11485008,11483480,11480520],"score":163,"time":1460471369,"title":"An MIT Underwear Exposé (and Sorting Hat)","type":"story","url":"http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/an-mit-underwear-expose"},{"by":"6stringmerc","descendants":304,"id":11479869,"kids":[11480415,11480271,11480075,11481307,11480131,11480559,11479872,11481124,11482888,11480705,11482746,11480619,11480122,11481027,11484302,11480553,11480901,11481993,11483880,11481103,11482604,11480899,11482625,11481876,11485018,11480379,11481902,11483874,11480890,11481001,11481430,11485244,11480026,11480803,11480700,11481246,11491300,11480240,11481115],"score":412,"time":1460471447,"title":"Steve Miller: The Whole Music Industry Is Fuckin' Gangsters and Crooks","type":"story","url":"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/steve-miller-this-whole-industry-is-f--kin-gangsters-and-crooks-20160411"},{"by":"wener","descendants":42,"id":11479840,"kids":[11480014,11482821,11481539,11485405],"score":160,"time":1460471228,"title":"Apache Storm 1.0 released","type":"story","url":"https://storm.apache.org/2016/04/12/storm100-released.html"},{"by":"betashop","descendants":2,"id":11479641,"kids":[11484437,11479819],"score":1,"text":"Hi.

In addition, students are forced to go through a system that restricts their learning to textbooks and lectures from professors that primarily do research and have no teaching experience or desire. This creates a terrible transition from higher education into the industry and life as an adult.<p>InventEd: Our organization is a personalized higher education alternative that allows our students to develop their own personal and professional goals that drive their curriculum. Our flexible environment will allow students to acquire an education utilizing their preferred learning style, whether its visual, audio, hands-on, etc. As a non-profit organization, we will utilize a volunteer base of retired engineers, current engineers, and anyone with the right amount of expertise to help mentor these students during their self-driven education. We will provide a direct line between the students acquiring an education and the companies that are interested in hiring students that are self-motivated with valuable real-world experience.<p>About Us: Founder (Dustin Poisson) is a graduate from the University of Michigan with a Aerospace background. He has gotten extensively involved with STEM education since moving down to Huntsville, AL. He has spoke to countless engineers, professors, and other STEM-focused individuals who back this concept. Co-Founder (Cody Stepko) is an Auburn University graduate with an Industrial engineering background who has an interest in an alternative higher education concept because he struggled in the current system as well. Both his parents are teachers and he has always had the passion to become a teacher as well.<p>If you have any further questions on our progress or our organization in general, feel free to comment!<p>Thank you and look forward to hearing from the HackerNews community.","time":1460405950,"title":"Apply HN: InventEd","type":"story"},{"by":"xweb","descendants":7,"id":11474878,"kids":[11475574,11475432,11475292],"score":24,"time":1460407086,"title":"React Router is dead.

Our intention was to create a behavioural data science platform where the talent and tools in big data can be used to solve problems that matter to society. The focus has been on problems that one way or the other are related to human behaviour.<p>In this platform you can pick a project and explain why you think it’s important. Then you can ask for data and resources you need for it from your audience, and if they also feel it’s importance, they can help you out.<p>For example, take behaviour of schizophrenic patients. To understand this, you need data on contact and mobility pattern, and quality of social interaction from a set of schizophrenic and normal population. Then you can train machine learning algorithms to highlight early symptoms. Ethica allows you to borrow data you need from people who meet the criteria and also feel the need, and helps you with the analysis and modelling tools.<p>We have been working on it for past three years, and there has been some small tractions around it as well. We believe the problem is very important and sooner or later we will see some solution for it, whether from us or others.","time":1460389195,"title":"Apply HN: Ethica Data, Behavioural Data Science Platform","type":"story"},{"by":"srikar","descendants":22,"id":11472244,"kids":[11477215,11480398,11478850,11480326,11479004,11479471,11480095,11475832,11476991],"score":97,"time":1460389120,"title":"Scientists Unveil New ‘Tree of Life’","type":"story","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/12/science/scientists-unveil-new-tree-of-life.html"},{"by":"iriche","descendants":204,"id":11472232,"kids":[11472744,11472529,11473814,11473227,11474582,11472525,11474904,11472487,11472897,11473804,11472396,11472947,11474021,11472368,11472447,11491251,11512197,11474015,11476349,11503002,11473726,11473240,11474232,11483439,11472979,11473717,11473086,11472569,11476008,11474535,11473188,11472497,11472657],"score":273,"time":1460389048,"title":"The Swedish Number – Talk with a Random Swede","type":"story","url":"http://theswedishnumber.com"},{"by":"chollida1","descendants":162,"id":11472094,"kids":[11472972,11473600,11473125,11472984,11473161,11472970,11473352,11473166,11474649,11473349,11473757,11473305,11472956,11473356,11472925,11472981,11472780,11472730,11473408,11473287,11473974,11472749,11472847,11472968,11472777,11472871,11473187],"score":109,"time":1460388149,"title":"Goldman Sachs Resolves U.S. Mortgage Probe for $5.1B","type":"story","url":"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-11/goldman-to-pay-5-1-billion-to-settle-u-s-mortgage-bond-probe"},{"by":"defrex","descendants":3,"id":11472009,"kids":[11472147,11472811],"score":12,"text":"Spendwell is a productivity tool for your finances.

Most training companies focus on security awareness for regular employees (making sure your receptionist doesn&#x27;t click on phishing emails) or infosec training for security professionals (learning how to perform penetration tests). Developers have to make do with books, blog posts, and online videos.<p>We&#x27;ve taken the most common security vulnerabilities and put together a series of interactive exercises that ask a developer to put themselves in the shoes of a hacker. Next, we show how to protect against these vulnerabilities with real code samples. Finally, we test developers on what they&#x27;ve learnt.<p>The beta launched a few weeks ago and the feedback has been amazing. We hit the front page of reddit (300,000+ page views in one day) and have more than 13,000 sign-ups so far.

So, here is my current situation:<p>I started working at a part of Oracle back in September, and over the next several months my coworkers one aisle over from me have begun talking about my sexuality in a very demeaning manner.

This is also followed up with jokes about how I &#x27;think&#x27; I&#x27;m Bi, and how thats a bunch of bullshit. I work in an area where I am one of the only engineers and am surrounded by a bunch of what I would call Prep School types.<p>I have tried to ignore it, and brush it off, but it gets in my head and makes me really upset. Which is then in turn misinterpreted as me having a &#x27;bad attitude&#x27;. I have opened up to several other people at work about it and they have suggested going to HR. I have never really been the type to go to teacher, but I feel like I&#x27;m kind of out of options here.

Those behind the adoption chopped and screwed Amazon&#x27;s document, manufacturing a customized, Company-esque version of leadership principles. It mostly looks like a summary of the original, with a friendlier, less boarding-school-like tone.<p>The adoption&#x2F;adaptation is scary. We aren&#x27;t robots. We aren&#x27;t numbers.

The cause is that most certifications, even when awarded with rigor, measure the students ability to cram and regurgitate knowledge a short time after the material was taught. No certificate or degree provides any measure of how much of knowledge or skill is retained 6 or 12 months later.<p>Since any potential employer can&#x27;t rely on a candidate&#x27;s certificate&#x2F;degree to indicate that they  actually knows the material (or can apply it), they are forced into retesting every candidate (i.e. the dreaded technical interview). This is an incredible wasteful process for both candidates and the employers. What is needed is a certification process that can&#x27;t be gamed that measures true retention of knowledge and skill.<p>Solution: Use an approach similar to WADA&#x27;s whereabouts system [1, 2] that is used to detect drug cheats in sport. Certificate&#x2F;degree holders would be tested on their knowledge and skills at some point after the certificate&#x2F;degree was awarded. Holders would be able to register their availability for testing at certain times and days on a system similar to the WADA ADAMS system [3]. They would be called at 12 hours notice anytime over the next 3 to 12 months and asked to sit a test in one of their nominated times slots. Failure to be available for the test would mean a fail.<p>Such as system would prevent cramming and it would only measure long term knowledge retention as there would be too short a warning of when they were to be tested. The knowledge tested could then be certified by the testing agency to be Real&amp;True™. Employers would not need to test a candidate again in the interview process.<p>1. http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usada.org&#x2F;testing&#x2F;whereabouts&#x2F;<p>2. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wada-ama.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;questions-answers&#x2F;whereabouts<p>3. http:&#x2F;&#x2F;adams-docs.wada-ama.org&#x2F;display&#x2F;EN&#x2F;Welcome+to+the+ADAMS+Knowledge+Base+in+English","time":1460251942,"title":"Apply HN: Skill Certification You Can Trust","type":"story"},{"by":"santosh_ankr","descendants":4,"id":11464334,"kids":[11482450,11466916],"score":8,"time":1460251183,"title":"Show HN: Quotekey – Personalize your SSH keys","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/santoshankr/quotekey"},{"by":"adamcath","descendants":4,"id":11464366,"kids":[11465272,11466283],"score":5,"time":1460251652,"title":"Show HN: ads: Tool to start, stop, and manage microservices in a codebase","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/adamcath/ads"},{"by":"rohamg","dead":true,"id":11464310,"kids":[11464555,11464556,11464552],"score":17,"time":1460250797,"title":"Obama can appoint Merrick Garland to Supreme Court if the Senate does nothing","type":"story","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/obama-can-appoint-merrick-garland-to-the-supreme-court-if-the-senate-does-nothing/2016/04/08/4a696700-fcf1-11e5-886f-a037dba38301_story.html"},{"by":"davismwfl","descendants":3,"id":11464285,"kids":[11464956,11464697,11464442],"score":2,"text":"What home office chair do you use and what do you think works best?

My experience was fairly unpleasant and I&#x27;m wondering how it compares to what you&#x27;ve encountered.<p>I&#x27;ll cover the basics just to add a bit of context.  They&#x27;re an online retailer of women&#x27;s products, and the project involves an application for facilitating support calls from their customers.  The outreach email mentioned that the VP of Engineering was interested in my skill set given that I&#x27;ve been a Lead Engineer at a couple of startups.  On my end, I&#x27;ve been doing contract work for over a year now, and figured that I should be open to new opportunities.   So we set up a call, and it&#x27;s all downhill from here.<p>The recruiter started off by downgrading the position from a Lead Engineer to a Senior Engineer. This is after telling me that they reached out to me because of my experience as a lead, and after informing me that I would still be leading a team, and that I would be responsible for the architecture of the project.  I would have pretty much all of the responsibilities of a Lead Engineer, just not the title (aka the pay).<p>The recruiter then spent 15 minutes negging my experience, telling me how much smarter their employees are than I am, and informing me that the biggest perk to working there is the fact that I would have the opportunity to be surrounded by their brilliance.  The conversation finally ended when I asked for salary ranges for this position and he refused to provide them.<p>In retrospect, it seems like this recruiter is out there just looking for someone to screw over.  So, are recruiter calls typically this bad?  Do recruiters always balk at providing numbers?  Am I taking crazy pills to think that this behavior was out of line?  What has your experience been like?","time":1460242750,"title":"Ask HN: Are all recruiter calls this bad?","type":"story"},{"by":"kblander","descendants":4,"id":11463833,"kids":[11464051,11464226,11464068,11463870],"score":3,"text":"For example, at a company that has &quot;an&quot; iOS developer or &quot;an&quot; Android developer, as opposed to a team - a pretty common arrangement in startups, I think.

Sending small gifts to customers is not scalable. Generic postcards and mailers are ineffective.<p>Solution: Melt is an API that devs can effortlessly tie into and trigger gift sending based on whatever conditions they want (customers bday, purchase amount, 10th purchase, etc.) Small gifts can be customized with customer info. We handle the production, customization and mailing and figuring out how to scale. Small gift ideas: chocolate, giftcards, flower(s), handwritten notes, whatever to delight your customer.<p>About us: I&#x27;m a developer and previously built and maintained a large hosting company&#x27;s billing and customer service APIs. I&#x27;m a two time startup founder and also built a real estate company to mid six figures income while still in college. My partner is at Wharton working on her MBA. She previously scaled an ecommerce food startup from $45k MMR to $105k MMR in six months and worked at Uber doing operations and logistics.<p>Vision: We want to build a platform for anyone to send physical goods, seamlessly. What stripe did for payments we want to do for, say, chocolate bars and flowers.<p>Market: We&#x27;re targeting client based businesses initially as they already send gifts to customers. Think Realtors, Brokers, Lawyers. Eventually any company looking to improve customer engagement and relationships would benefit from Melt.<p>Progress: I&#x27;ve been working on the code since late February. API MVP is about 75% complete. Web app is about 25% complete. We have ~35 signups from a small reddit post I threw up a month ago.

Trying to find a document which we created or downloaded few months or even days ago will require answering questions like was I at home or office while downloading it, did I receive it over an email or did I store in dropbox? You quickly make an assumption and search for the filename or keywords there and if you don&#x27;t find it you search in other places until you find it or you give up.<p>Vaultedge : is an attempt to help find your document quickly just in few clicks. I personally faced this problem in my previous job as Software Architect and asked people around on what tools they use. Leaving aside few who were well organized, rest of the folks faced the same issue. They would love to have a tool which will allow search across their online and offline content contextually like to search for &quot;last three months of cell phone bills&quot; or &quot;the document on networking send by x&quot;. They were also interested in a grouping capability which groups documents into similar categories so that they can see \n- all their bills in one place\n- to highlight the difference between the fluctuating cable or cell phone bills month over month\n- to download bills for a month in bulk\n- easily find all tax records for a year etc<p>With those two functionalities (Search &amp; Grouping) in mind we are building Vaultedge. Contextual search is something we are still building.<p>About us: \nI have spent all my life (~16 years) building enterprise products for Storage, Data and Analytics, my last job being Architect for Backup products at NetApp. I&#x27;m a sole founder and backend developer now, but in talks with another tech guy to join as co-founder.

A blogger writes about the topic of fishing for beginner fishers. He talks about things the wannabe fishers must buy and places they must go.

I tried the usual way first - looking on online classifieds and trying in vain to schedule time. I did not want to waste money by signing up somebody for the full season. Somehow, I finally found a &quot;professional&quot; who came out, saw my broken leg and the long grass growing, and quoted me an insane price which I declined. Luckily for me, a student knocked on my door asking if I needed my lawn mowed, and he did the same job very happily for $15 (I added some tip as well of course). Here is the tough question now -- how do I regularly find local students to do odd chores for me, on-demand ?<p>Solution:  \nI used the MacBook to learn and train myself and heck built and published this app on both iOS and Android. My leg was broken, not my fingers and my brain, and I coded a solution for myself with &quot;Runnr&quot;. It is an app through which people can find and book neighborhood students who can simply walk over to their house to mow their lawn, tutor their kids, walk their dog or a whole range of other simple chores. The cost stays low as this is not mortgage money for these kids and they are not travelling across the city for these jobs. Runnr provides them with an app to manage their time and their jobs, along with suitable marketing tools to help them promote this within their own neighborhood. This is their own &quot;lemonade business&quot;.<p>Happiness would be in:\nFree&#x2F;sponsored chores done for elderly&#x2F;physically challenged which count as community credits for these students.\nEnsuring the students get 100% of the price advertised to the customer. \nTurning this into a global on-demand work platform where anybody can turn on the app and make him&#x2F;herself available for work.","time":1460148242,"title":"Apply HN: Hire local students for simple chores like mowing your lawn","type":"story"},{"by":"ninjavis","descendants":7,"id":11457691,"kids":[11457696,11457789,11464957],"score":4,"time":1460147646,"title":"Show HN: I negotiate up to 95% SaaS discounts for an interested subscriber base","type":"story","url":"http://upperhound.com/"},{"by":"annoyeduser","descendants":2,"id":11457594,"kids":[11457707,11458334,11457765],"score":6,"text":"We were prepared to launch our product today when my boss invited me to a service named FullStory [0].<p>I joined and I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes.

Beyond the basic concept, we also have whole slew of ideas about important features, UI and general program logic.<p>The app would be useful for owners of a single airplane&#x2F;helicopter, but would probably be most helpful for owners of 2+ aircraft. Software like this does exist for passenger airlines &amp; very big air freight companies - but it&#x27;s prohibitively expensive for most private owners and small corporate fleets.<p>Additional Background:<p>Our dad has been an airplane &amp; helicopter pilot for 25+ years and in that time has owned numerous aircraft. For 18+ years, he owned &amp; operated the biggest helicopter flight training school in the Midwest... I basically grew up at the airport.<p>So, we have deep contacts within the local &amp; regional aviation community. Many of his friends and former students are themselves aircraft owners - so we have big headstart on finding early test users. *Also have contacts into the aviation departments at some of the big St. Louis-based corporations (e.g., Anheuser-Busch, Emerson Electric). Likewise, we have a firm grasp on the industry trade publications, trade shows and other marketing&#x2F;advertising venues.","time":1460145715,"title":"Apply HN: Aerfolio – Digital Aircraft Logbooks","type":"story"},{"by":"jashmenn","descendants":15,"id":11457322,"kids":[11458579,11460739,11457576,11458136,11460385,11460141,11460119,11459294,11457512],"score":193,"time":1460144539,"title":"The Book of Shaders","type":"story","url":"http://thebookofshaders.com/"},{"by":"prostoalex","descendants":11,"id":11457313,"kids":[11457895,11457737,11457661,11457992,11457854],"score":9,"time":1460144471,"title":"Issues for Self-Driving Cars in U.S. Cities","type":"story","url":"http://www.inc.com/betsy-mikel/why-self-driving-cars-could-be-a-design-nightmare-for-us-cities.html"},{"by":"mattiemass","descendants":69,"id":11457265,"kids":[11460807,11461513,11461203,11463049,11465000,11460860,11462614,11462612,11465921,11460973,11462483,11462168,11461799,11463981],"score":114,"time":1460144131,"title":"Self-driving truck convoy completes its first major journey across Europe","type":"story","url":"http://www.theverge.com/2016/4/7/11383392/self-driving-truck-platooning-europe"},{"by":"cryptoz","descendants":354,"id":11457263,"kids":[11458217,11458267,11457288,11458341,11457827,11457968,11458652,11458253,11457905,11457844,11457833,11460388,11457875,11458113,11458220,11457850,11457841,11457999,11457864,11458754,11459117,11458967,11458201,11457936,11457876,11459068,11460344,11459920,11458675,11458657,11458096,11459024,11458997,11460197,11459352,11457915,11458790,11460441,11458668,11458066,11458865,11459428,11458215,11459768,11457931,11457903,11457861,11458134,11457824,11459177,11457985,11459320,11457832,11457868,11458580,11458786,11457830,11457782,11457839,11458123,11457823,11457845,11458767],"score":845,"time":1460144128,"title":"SpaceX Launch Livestream: CRS-8 Dragon Hosted Webcast","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pUAydjne5M#t=27m15s"},{"by":"konklone","descendants":29,"id":11457276,"kids":[11458041,11458158,11457723,11459373,11457635],"score":69,"time":1460144218,"title":"How we get high availability with Elasticsearch and Ruby on Rails","type":"story","url":"https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/04/08/how-we-get-high-availability-with-elasticsearch-and-ruby-on-rails/"},{"by":"raverbashing","descendants":39,"id":11457203,"kids":[11457409,11457480,11457819,11457334,11457466,11461176,11457632,11457952,11458207,11457365,11457589,11457630],"score":32,"time":1460143650,"title":"Google, Don't make me hate you","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@dsracoon/google-don-t-make-me-hate-you-f599de12dbf7"},{"by":"simplystats","descendants":6,"id":11457142,"kids":[11457271,11457550],"score":22,"time":1460143191,"title":"How to be a modern scientist","type":"story","url":"https://leanpub.com/modernscientist"},{"by":"gberger","descendants":22,"id":11457152,"kids":[11457196,11458129,11458913,11457180,11457178,11460289,11458615,11461469,11458348,11459366],"score":11,"time":1460143280,"title":"Chariot for Women is a new ride sharing service for women only","type":"story","url":"http://techcrunch.com/2016/04/08/chariot-for-women-is-a-new-ride-sharing-service-for-women-only/"},{"by":"eplanit","descendants":33,"id":11457135,"kids":[11457890,11457402,11457413,11457802,11458482,11457333],"score":43,"time":1460143133,"title":"U.S. Post Office Makes Stamps Cheaper for the First Time in 100 Years","type":"story","url":"http://fortune.com/2016/04/07/usps-post-office-stamps/"},{"by":"ingve","descendants":16,"id":11457083,"kids":[11461853,11460584,11462910,11461121,11461840,11462975,11462206,11460658,11461543,11461598],"score":67,"time":1460142788,"title":"Chartd: responsive, retina-compatible charts with just an img tag","type":"story","url":"http://chartd.co/"},{"by":"pier25","descendants":85,"id":11457073,"kids":[11457525,11457398,11457578,11458463,11457626,11457388,11457757,11458225,11457620,11457511,11457540,11457749,11457680,11457913,11458838,11457621,11457666,11457688],"score":76,"time":1460142692,"title":"Apple's aging Mac Pro is falling behind Windows rivals","type":"story","url":"http://www.computerworld.com/article/3052871/computer-hardware/apples-aging-mac-pro-is-falling-far-behind-windows-rivals.html"},{"by":"hillsidefm","descendants":5,"id":11457015,"kids":[11515464,11457237,11462699,11457128],"score":2,"text":"Hillside.fm lets you listen to music with other people in rooms.

However, they do a poor job of ensuring that people are able to make the best use of their time.

Our software will then automatically find an opening, adjusting participants&#x27; schedules as needed to make space for the meeting.  More generally, our software takes the place of a calendaring assistant: users paint a broad picture of how they want their days, weeks, and months to look (ex. what gets priority, when meetings need to happen, who needs to be invited, where meetings should be held, etc) and we work out a specific schedule that best fits those needs.<p>By understanding the “who, what, when, where, and why” behind each calendar event, we’ll make sure people spend less time coordinating, and more time doing.","time":1460131582,"title":"Apply HN: AskWhen – An Executive Assistant for Everyone","type":"story"},{"by":"bflesch","descendants":3,"id":11455670,"kids":[11455901,11455700],"score":10,"text":"Dear HN,<p>I&#x27;m CEO of a Germany-based eSports startup and we have a problem.<p>Today we were approached by a Chinese user of our website who told us that a China-based startup has launched a direct clone of our website aimed at the Chinese market.<p>Our website https:&#x2F;&#x2F;strivewire.com is a host of for-money eSports tournaments in the Hearthstone vertical, but we are working on expanding to other games as well.<p>The website in question is a very obvious clone of ours and has both .com and .cn domains: \n- www.haogegebisai.com\n- www.chosengamer.com<p>Basically they copied all the design and even our logo down to the actual URLs.<p>I&#x27;ve added their CEO on WeChat and inquired about this, and he said they are big fans of our startup.

I have lived there for months at a time with another developer - other developers have stopped by for hackathons and summits.<p>What the goal is: create a place for developers, newcomers, engineers and entrepreneurs to come together and ALWAYS have a place to live and learn. A place to try all your cool projects without the fear of failure.<p>Business model: Tech park and incubator model. I&#x27;ve left this intentionally vague as this business aspect of this concept needs the most attention. I am certain there is a good way to capitalize and it will be shaped in part by early members.<p>Why now is the right time: there is a perfect storm for developers: a lot of us can make money remotely. An internet connection in remote areas is now affordable and fast. Solar technology prices are plummeting. The permaculture movement has given us mountains of useful literature over the last decade.

We have partnered with one of NYC&#x27;s institutional defense providers to build a modern database service geared towards these needs.

First, we could use the money. It would be great if my brother could afford to move to NY with me and we could both tackle this full time. Second, I think we would benefit from the mentorship that YC and its network have to provide. It would be great to learn more from folks who have built great tech businesses.<p>Prior Work: we&#x27;ve been writing code and interviewing users for Casepad for about 3mo now.

Why Ketoconazole?<p>- Ketoconazole based shampoo makes significant reduction in hair loss.<p>- Dandruff is primarily caused by a fungus known as Pityrosporum ovale, which also causes flaking and itching of the scalp and is commonly present on most people’s scalp. Ketoconazole is the best defence against Pityrosporum ovale which helps in significant reduction of flaking and itching of the skin. Also Ketoconazole binds to the natural protein in hair called keratin. So it keeps working for days after hair wash.<p>2. Improved product:<p>- Dryness - Washing hair with Ketoconazole shampoo leaves hair dry. So it becomes really important to apply hair oil before using the shampoo. To address dryness, Love &amp; Care Subscription pack will include hair oil to apply before wash.<p>- Smell, texture and lather of current Ketoconazole shampoo&#x27;s are bad as compared to the other regular famous brands like Pantene, Dove, Head &amp; Shoulders. This alone can amazingly improve the product quality.<p>- Bottling and packaging of the current ketoconazole based shampoo makes them look like medicated shampoo. Design of Love and Care bottle will be modern, travel friendly and 100% recyclable.<p>3. Why Subscription?<p>- Convenience - Most of the people use shampoo twice a week. Its an important necessity in a modern lifestyle. With subscription model we will deliver exactly what people need and when they need it. And our customers won&#x27;t have to worry about commitment as they can pause or cancel subscription any time.<p>- Love &amp; Care will have enough shampoo for 8 washes, that means its can run for 1 month for a person who shampoo their hair twice a week.<p>- Free standard shipping and additional cost for expedited shipping.<p>- Transparency - Unlike other major shampoo brands that don&#x27;t disclose their ingredients, we will tell our customers absolutely everything.

This can be greatly improved by providing attorneys with a tool that allows them to do data mining from social media and any other sources and aggregate it to a probability of how that juror is likely to vote.<p>A tool that gives an attorney more insight into jurors would be incredibly valuable to them.  If you have millions on the line, paying even a few hundred to get information about a potential jury is a bargain.<p>While giving one attorney a strong advantage, thereby effecting the outcome of a case, can seem questionable, the justice system designed jury selection to be in the lose&#x2F;lose quadrant of possible scenarios.  Ideally a more equitable and fair jury is chosen by both attorneys eliminating those against them as best they can.  This also means though should one attorney have an effective tool selecting jurors others are highly incentivized to use that same tool.

And in consequence of solving that 2 problems we offer 3 great improvements.<p>Problems:<p>1. Freelancers usually take more work than they should. And we get it. It&#x27;s hard for a freelancer say no to a contract&#x2F;work&#x2F;gig because is the way they make a living.\nBut this often end in a big workload and then delayed deliveries of their tasks.<p>2. Companies&#x2F;entrepreneurs spend a good amount of time looking for a good freelance when they have to outsource some work. Checking the portafolio, the references, the reviews, the background. And then, the conversation between freelancer-company can have between 8-15 emails before the work is begun. Next depending on the work size the delivery in no less than a week.<p>Solutions that trely offers:<p>1. We look, interview, and vet the freelancers before we accept them in our platform. We look in their resumes, portafolio, background, and references. Then we make them 3 test and the result is that we work only with 15% of the initial candidates.<p>2. Companies only need to fill a detailed form of their needs and a freelancer can take the job. They can select a time frame of delivery. If the clients are in a rush the price increase.<p>3. As consequence of #1 and #2 the freelancers only take and work one task at a time. Our platafform only allow freelancers to take one job and delivered fast mantaining top quality. This allowed us to offer services on-demand (24 hours or less depending on the task).<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;trely.co<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;olBBWpDOiiU  (spanish)<p>PD: Sorry if my text have typos.

Interconnection: You can do trigger actions on the devices you own (in real time) - for example, if temp in antartica weather station is less than 30, email me or turn on light at home, etc . All this with no programming.<p>Use Cases:\n1. Companies make internal phone apps all the time. In the future, they are going to make internal IOT devices and they need a platform for that. We are that.<p>2. You have an idea for an IOT device, use our service to create the device - you focus on the device coz the backend, website, phone app is all done. Scale from 1 to a million.<p>3.

Still it’s very manual process to buy someone gift card. \n2. One can use vendors website(for e.g. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.starbucks.com&#x2F;card) to buy and send soft copy of gift card to recipient using email, which recipient needs to retrieve every time they want to use the gift card.\n3. Problem with Gyft: To buy closed loop gift card for prospective recipient, one needs to know the recipient’s buying habits quite well. For example, the person doesn&#x27;t like coffee that much and you give them a &#x27;Starbucks&#x27; gift card. Also Gyft is not available outside USA.\n4. Customer has to carry hardcover gift cards every time they shop so there are higher chances of them being misplaced. \n5. If customers fail to spend the full value of their gift cards, unspent gift cards dollars get expired OR they are forced to buy unnecessary or bit expensive item to just use the remaining gift card amount.\n6. Customer neither gets any card expiry notification nor any promotional notification.<p>Solution:\nOur idea is to develop a Gift card service, possibly a mobile app and a web app, where one person can gift any dollar amount as a credit to another using their mobile number. Recipient can then use that amount as credit to purchase any company&#x27;s gift card and buy the thing they really want and have control over the amount they want to spend. For example, if someone gives you $100 and you want to buy an iPhone cover for say $50, then you transfer $50 to Apple Gift Card and buy yourself that cover. Then you can use remain $50 with say Starbucks. Moreover, credit never expires, so your money&#x2F;gift is not wasted. Customers also receives notification about special offers from gift card providers, so they can choose when&#x2F;where to spend their credit. For example, Apple sells gift cards at 20% off, our customers can get benefit out of that, making the most of the gift they were given.","time":1460042359,"title":"Apply HN: App to send, buy and maintain pre-paid gift cards","type":"story"},{"by":"antr","descendants":3,"id":11447926,"kids":[11448419,11448628,11448885],"score":10,"time":1460042362,"title":"Apple's copycats are turning into true iPhone competitors","type":"story","url":"http://www.theverge.com/2016/4/6/11379640/apple-huawei-xiaomi-design-competition"},{"by":"joak","descendants":6,"id":11447923,"kids":[11476775,11450192,11449014],"score":2,"text":"Talking with a previously unknown person is common in the real world but is quite hard to do online.

Focus on building a people network and, content will follow.\nRather than going to a bunch of websites to finding stuff your folks share everywhere, get them via one stream. Always be implicitly aware of what people in your network are interested in rather than what they want to appear when they choose to share selectively.<p>How it works?<p>- Install Chrome&#x2F;Safari&#x2F;Firefox extension for your favorite browser.<p>- Signup using Facebook (Or, some other online network) where you have built your social group.<p>- Every time you discover new stuff online (links, text, images, videos etc) they are transmitted to people in your network anonymously and vice versa.<p>- Initially, software will display content to you in the order of frecency with an expiry of 24 hours. But, because extension has access to your local browsing history, it will evolve to digest that data to always order the content based on your recent interest.<p>- This may include options to allow sharing by applying filters and type of content user wants.<p>- Also, sharing data exists just in your browser and, platform memory lasts for the period of delivery, similar to Whatsapp.<p>Concerns?<p>- Privacy<p>AFAIK, Most people would love to have a read access to their network info but, will be concerned about providing read access. It is likely that if you intimately know someone, you might be able to pinpoint the person it&#x27;s emanating from but, that should be OK in future where people are willingly sharing most stuff about them via Instagram, Twitter, Facebook etal. There has always been tradeoff between privacy and access and, I, personally believe that we are moving towards the direction where latter trumps former.<p>PS: I have been thinking about this idea for few months now.

Planning a trip to a new place is usually tiresome, with reading a lot of reviews on TripAdvisor, asking a lot of relatives or friends for suggestions, using the existing trip planner websites that suggest pre-generated itineraries - that probably worked for someone else.<p>2. After carefully considering a lot of choices, the user finally decides on a trip plan. But things may change - there might be new events coming up in the travel destination which the user doesn&#x27;t want to miss or there might be last minute issues like a traffic jam or a bad hotel experience. The user is forced to stick to the previously decided plan and compromise!<p><i>What we do:</i><p>1. We do all the painstaking work of understanding the reviews on TripAdvisor and similar sites, learn what the user&#x27;s network is speaking about various travel destinations, the ones the user like the most - take into consideration the user&#x27;s budget, seat preferences, meal stops, gas stations, driving time, sleeping habits, previous travel history, nationality and visa requirements etc., and build the most suitable &amp; easily editable trip plan for the user. (The final aim of this app is to make sure the user won&#x27;t press the edit button. i.e., the itinerary generated is perfect for the user). <i>We track the user&#x27;s trip and suggest Plan B, just in case</i><p>2. We want to offer the user with hotel&#x2F;car&#x2F;event&#x2F;flight bookings with no booking or cancellation charges.<p><i>Is this even feasible?</i><p>1. Yes. We are in a process of building an AI engine that makes the trip planning possible. The aim is to get the user choose a perfect trip plan without spending hours to input all the details. 128HS aims to capture the user&#x27;s family members&#x27;details as well and keep learning when to show what!<p>2. The same AI engine calculates the probability of a user cancelling a hotel, a flight or any event, and tries it best to minimize such a probability. Minimizing this probability would mean ensuring the quality from the partners, using historic data and the likability by the user.<p>Sreyanth<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;128highstreet.com","time":1460023894,"title":"Apply HN: 128Highstreet – A Trip Planning App","type":"story"},{"by":"greenonion","descendants":98,"id":11446223,"kids":[11447922,11446405,11447862,11446916,11446523,11446536,11446505,11452043,11446580,11451600,11447525,11452235,11446579,11446366,11447529,11448130,11447192,11447915,11452111],"score":375,"time":1460025786,"title":"Recreating Daft Punk's Da Funk with Overtone and Leipzig","type":"story","url":"http://overtone-recipes.github.io/remake/2016/04/03/recreating-da-funk.html"},{"by":"gpresot","descendants":2,"id":11446075,"kids":[11446144,11446221],"score":5,"time":1460023282,"title":"Panama Papers Scandal: Why This Is Still Legal","type":"story","url":"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/04/panama-papers-crimes/477156/?single_page=true"},{"by":"pilif","descendants":5,"id":11446047,"kids":[11460555,11459645,11459340],"score":34,"time":1460022778,"title":"Investigating the Potential for Miscommunication Using Emoji","type":"story","url":"http://grouplens.org/blog/investigating-the-potential-for-miscommunication-using-emoji/"},{"by":"jaktran","descendants":10,"id":11445956,"kids":[11461523,11448915,11450731],"score":2,"text":"getforum.co<p>FORUM is social app available on Android (public bêta) that propose to user to share their thoughts (400 chars max) on any subject they want.

Shop discoverability, client retention, payments, booking, wait times, and eventually booth rent, and buyers remorse.(Hope those last two intrigue you.)<p>How It Works:\n---------------------\nAll payment&#x2F;booking apps on the market solve two problems: they replace cash with digital payments and automate booking. SHARPX does these as well, but takes it further by solving the real problem: client retention.<p>Barber Example: SHARPX member purchases 3 haircuts&#x2F;month which translate into &quot;Swipes&quot;. Swipes can be used to get a haircut at any shop participating in SHARPX. Haircuts are typically $25, but with SHARPX the price decreases 10% (give or take) for every swipe bought. So buying 2 haircut swipes brings the unit price down to $22.50($46&#x2F;month), and 3 haircut swipes brings unit price to $20.25 ($60&#x2F;month). Swipes are use or lose.<p>Payouts from membership swipes for each vertical will be set, but to account for cost of living, shops decide what they services they will offer for a swipe. Payouts will be set such that most fall in the sweet spot. This system allows the customer to get their hair cut anywhere, but also guarantees repeat business for the service provider.<p>Pay-As-You-Go: For those who are scared of commitment, the app will also have Pay-As-You-Go options to buy ad-hoc.<p>Monetizing\n-----------------------\nSHARPX will follow the OpenTable model. SP’s pay a fixed price per month plus a small percentage of every client check-in via swipe.<p>Questions? Constructive Criticism?

A Developer uses these APIs perhaps because of its reputation in the Developer community. Perhaps someone has used it in the past and found it to be useful. However, this is genuinely a leap of faith they take to use a tool in their application and trust it implicitly. But what happens when that trust is broken? What happens if that API doesn’t work as well or costs too much? That Developer has to dig back into their code, remove dependencies, and recode their application in a process that takes time. Sometimes lots of time.<p>Meet Brightwork.<p>Brightwork is an API Developer Tool. But it’s so much more. With Brightwork Developers can now see usage information as well as performance information about the APIs they use with their application. They can also see cost projections for their APIs as it relates to competing APIs. However, we take it all a step further. Now Developers can simply click a button in the Brightwork dashboard and switch APIs without having to write one line of code. We do all the heavy lifting in the integration layer and move the API so Developers can spend more time building applications that are agile, meaningful, saves them time, and ultimately money.<p>On top of offering all of this intelligence with their APIs, we’re offering full stack profiles. These are what we’re calling “BrightStacks” but are pre-built API bundles that can be used in their full stack. So instead of programming these services individually, entire stacks can now be turned up in minutes, not hours or days.<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;brightwork.io","time":1459976725,"title":"Apply HN: Brightwork – Making APIs More Intelligent","type":"story"},{"by":"chroem-","descendants":24,"id":11442038,"kids":[11442078,11444592,11459733,11442990,11442679,11442520,11442235],"score":36,"text":"We are developing software which automates much of the design work for engineering problems in structural mechanics, heat transfer, and fluid dynamics.

Perhaps if HN picked startups, it would pick differently than YC. Maybe different startups would be motivated to apply, if they knew that the interviewing and deciding would be done by the HN community. Interesting things might happen, or they might not. We&#x27;d have to try it and see.<p>I ran this by Sam and he ran it by Kevin and we all got excited, so we&#x27;re going to try this as an experiment. Starting today, there&#x27;s a new track for YC applications: applying directly to the Hacker News community. We&#x27;ll call it &quot;Apply HN&quot;. Note that word experiment! We&#x27;ll start small and figure it out as we go. But here are the initial conditions.<p>YC’s Fellowship program will fund a minimum of 2 startups selected by the HN community for this summer&#x27;s F3 batch. (They name their batches sequentially.) The Fellowship is the YC program that fits best here since it’s designed to be experimental and inclusive and doesn’t require people to move to the Bay Area.<p>All the interviewing and evaluating will be done in regular HN threads, and everyone is welcome to participate. For this summer&#x27;s batch, Apply HN will accept applications starting now and ending April 27.<p>If you&#x27;d like to apply to the HN community for YCF funding, simply post a submission whose title begins with &quot;Apply HN&quot; and explain what your startup does. Hopefully community members will ask you questions and good discussion will ensue.<p>If you&#x27;d like to help pick which startups to fund, simply jump into any Apply HN thread that interests you. Ask questions and post comments that you think will help the community make the best decisions. These will be regular threads, with all the same voting and so on, but with one additional rule: Be Nice.<p>Be Nice is a stronger version of our usual rule, Be Civil. Anybody who applies to HN in public this way is putting both themselves and their baby in a super vulnerable position. We&#x27;re going to rise to the occasion by being not only civil, but nice. When interviewing startups, by all means be curious and probing—but only if you can also be nice. The word &quot;nice&quot; originally meant &quot;not knowing&quot;. Then later it meant &quot;precise and careful&quot;. And now it means &quot;kind and thoughtful&quot;. Let&#x27;s put all those qualities together.<p>At the end of the month, we&#x27;ll rank the startups and YC will fund two. The ranking will depend both on upvotes and on the quality of discussion, similar to how the ranking of stories works. We can talk about this in the comments, but to answer one question I know will come up: Upvotes are an important factor but they&#x27;re too brittle to rely on exclusively; doing so would encourage the wrong kind of trying to game the system. So we&#x27;re going to gauge community interest both by upvotes and comments, and in case of doubt I&#x27;ll make the final call—or better, figure out a way to put the final call to the community.<p>That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re thinking so far. If it seems unstructured, that&#x27;s on purpose: we don&#x27;t want to bias it along the lines of how YC already operates. We want to see what the community comes up with.<p>Questions or suggestions? Let&#x27;s discuss and refine this together.<p>Edit: As discussed below, we&#x27;ll add a top link for these a la &#x2F;ask and &#x2F;show. I won&#x27;t get to that till later, though, so in the meantime, use the following link to find Apply HN discussions: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=%22apply%20hn%22&amp;sort=byDate&amp;dateRange=all&amp;type=story&amp;storyText=false&amp;prefix=false&amp;page=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=%22apply%20hn%22&amp;sort=byDate&amp;d...</a><p>Edit 2: Here&#x27;s the link describing how YCF works: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fellowship.ycombinator.com&#x2F;faq&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fellowship.ycombinator.com&#x2F;faq&#x2F;</a>.

I have always been under the assumption that that was the entire purpose of a title which is to grab the readers attention and get them to read the article or in other words, in the context of the internet, be a bait for clicks.  While it&#x27;s not an excuse to have a misleading title, some articles are less technical and meant for a more general consumption so are they expected to have a title similar to that of one more serious and technical?  Even if the article is crap and the title is misleading it will either be filtered out of the front page or could even possibly insight a really good discussion. So instead of complaining about weather a title is clickbait, maybe it would be better to just explain what is wrong about the article instead to help prevent any misinformation or just ignore it and let it sink?","time":1459956894,"title":"Ask HN: Why are clickbait titles bad?","type":"story"},{"by":"sanketsahu","descendants":4,"id":11439234,"kids":[11440544,11439390,11439404,11439341],"score":6,"time":1459955104,"title":"React Native App Generator (Premium)","type":"story","url":"http://strapmobile.com/customizer"},{"by":"borekb","descendants":20,"id":11439173,"kids":[11439704,11439921,11439678,11440287,11440456,11439855,11440681,11445516,11440978],"score":137,"time":1459954584,"title":"VersionPress goes open source","type":"story","url":"https://blog.versionpress.net/2016/04/going-open-source/"},{"by":"navikohli","dead":true,"id":11439165,"kids":[11442851,11439688],"score":7,"time":1459954522,"title":"When It Comes to Age Bias, Tech Companies Don’t Even Bother to Lie","type":"story","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/when-comes-age-bias-tech-companies-dont-even-bother-lie-dan-lyons?trk=prof-post"},{"by":"alarbi","descendants":2,"id":11439097,"kids":[11439821,11439352],"score":2,"text":"- no heavy updates, ST3 is stuck in beta version for nearly 3 years or more.. \n- numerous free and light editors (VS Code, Atom) are gaining ground.

It just worked for the demo, who cares.\n2nd : Is it how people work in all embedded industry ? Giving an illusion of quality to deliver crap, earn time and negotiating time to correct it ?\n3rd : There was no time for me to learn how to improve, I was then assigned to another task, kthxbye.

In particular, look for tutorials that also involve testing and debugging.<p>3) Build app using the above technologies as an open source project and find someone I can pay to do code reviews of it.<p>4) Make flashcards and rote-memorize things that will help me look things up and navigate the codebase more quickly.<p>5) Aggregate a list of 100 webpages and build imitations of them in html and css and thereby finally teach myself by rote how CSS layout works.<p>6) Find someone outside the company (so they don&#x27;t have any input on performance reviews) I can trust to talk to about things like project management or recognizing when I&#x27;m miscommunicating or taking the wrong approach.<p>7) Find someone inside the company that I exchange help on their tickets with in exchange for letting me watch how they work to see if I can borrow habits to become more efficient.<p>Does this seem like a good list?

Any Internet corporation that does not jest well at April Fools is a step behind in the market.  Software engineers looking for a new job position are known to engage with potential employers based partly upon the corporate sense of humour. Brand value index is measured partly upon a corporation&#x27;s sense of humour and enjoyment of fun and laughter.  We know that by this measure, we are far ahead of the competition at Apple.<p>Google has always been a leader in April Fools jesting an even now when I think back to our previous hijinks I have a good chuckle.  That&#x27;s a lead we want to maintain.<p>In previous years we have allocated significant resources and budget to our April Fools jesting.  This budget and commitment to April Fools will remain strong into the future.<p>However, from 2017 onwards all April Fools projects will need a business case, management oversight and a steering committee.<p>We&#x27;ll not be approving all April Fools jesting from 2016 onwards.  Only the funniest and most clever jests will be funded and all will require a solid business case articulating the return on investment.<p>Most importantly, all future Aprils Fools plans must be evaluated by our corporate risk department and be approved as not representing business risk before going ahead.  Please, in 2017 I ask you not to go ahead with unauthorised April Fools pranks and jests.<p>Remember folks, Google loves to have an April Fools jest, we&#x27;ve worked hard to make ourselves the best jesters on the net.  But we need to do it safely and responsibly.  Funny is only funny if it does not land with a thud.<p>Thanks and keep laughing - may April 2017 be our best, most clever, witty, and safe April Fools ever.  I look forward to seeing what you come up with.<p>Sergey.<p>NB:<p>If you are unsure at all regarding your 2017 April Fools pranks please refer to Marton Sziraczki, Head of Risk Management, Google

Yes, I know what &quot;open source&quot; means - read on. The public availability of source code is just one part of &quot;open source&quot; tenets.<p>1. Community\nOpen source is software of the community, by the community and for the community.For mongodb it appears open source is a distribution strategy - there is no community participation. Now that they have achieved widespread distribution they could care less about open source.<p>Rumour is rife that the company is actively suing partners who are using the term &quot;mongo&quot; in either the product name or the domain name. My sources tell me that the recent rename of MongoLab to Mlab is a direct result of a trademark infringement notice sent by mongodb. I hear the same narrative from multiple other &quot;partners&quot; of mongodb. How is this any way to build an OSS ecosystem? Why would an ISV or OSS developer build tools for mongodb only to be sued by mongodb when they start to make money? Imagine the havoc that would ensue if Linus decides to enforce trademarks or licensing for Linux?<p>2. Enterprise vs Community\nThe feature differences between Enterprise and community versions of mongodb have started to get larger and larger with every release. Open source software does not mean &quot;inferior&quot; software or &quot;crippled&quot; software.<p>3. Controlled by a single company\nOne of the original goals of open source is to prevent the control of a single company over the software we use. To me it looks like mongodb is a step backwards in this direction.<p>Mongodb &quot;the product&quot; has some very good things going for it but dissatisfaction with Mongodb &quot;the company&quot; is fairly widespread.<p>My prediction is that very soon there will be a high profile open source fork of mongodb driven by an Apache style board and community. For now the only fork I can find is &quot;Percona server for MongoDB&quot; which seems a better fit for the OSS model. I am going to switch to Percona till my long term prediction comes true.","time":1459200276,"title":"Ask HN: Is MongoDB still an open source company?","type":"story"},{"by":"pdgcg","descendants":2,"id":11377461,"kids":[11377877,11377515],"score":6,"time":1459199758,"title":"How much water does California have?

Maybe less.<p>It may seem easy to find, but it&#x27;s been a 1.5 year struggle to find this kind of person.

The language could exist without a compiler, be abandoned, have no community or third-party packages&#x2F;modules, take 1 year to execute Project Euler&#x27;s Problem 1, etc.<p>I&#x27;m more interested in the discussion and process than in finding what the actual &quot;best&quot; language is.","time":1459005796,"title":"Ask HN: What's the best formal language?","type":"story"},{"by":"wallflower","descendants":34,"id":11365936,"kids":[11367047,11367466,11366992,11367940,11367390,11368440,11368607,11367385],"score":118,"time":1459005427,"title":"The Veil of Ignorance","type":"story","url":"http://mrmrs.io/writing/2016/03/23/the-veil-of-ignorance"},{"by":"mtviewdave","descendants":7,"id":11365795,"kids":[11368659,11368903],"score":51,"time":1459003701,"title":"Project West Ford","type":"story","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_West_Ford"},{"by":"edward","descendants":7,"id":11365757,"kids":[11368038,11368054],"score":13,"time":1459003007,"title":"Obama Discusses Airbnb's Success in Cuba [video]","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP6TH3pBPi8"},{"by":"hvo","descendants":5,"id":11365693,"kids":[11368012,11367956,11367919,11367769,11367745],"score":27,"time":1459001719,"title":"Why We Think We’re Better Investors Than We Are","type":"story","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/your-money/why-we-think-were-better-investors-than-we-are.html"},{"by":"winterismute","descendants":49,"id":11365678,"kids":[11366714,11366025,11366965,11366030,11365882,11367019,11366092],"score":95,"time":1459001376,"title":"“What Went Right and What Went Wrong”: Analysis of 155 Postmortems from Gamedev","type":"story","url":"http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=262301"},{"by":"parro-it","descendants":87,"id":11365683,"kids":[11367496,11365877,11365895,11366940,11367495,11367004,11366556,11365924,11366776,11366034,11365800,11366357,11365938,11366640,11365744,11365839,11366604,11366202],"score":98,"time":1459001511,"title":"Show HN: Kikked – check if any of your NPM repos is trademarked","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/parro-it/canibekiked"},{"by":"irickt","descendants":7,"id":11365634,"kids":[11369231,11370492,11370389,11370843,11369379,11369804],"score":47,"time":1459000138,"title":"The Impious Delights of Hieronymus Bosch","type":"story","url":"https://newrepublic.com/article/132024/impious-delights-hieronymus-bosch"},{"by":"Garbage","descendants":61,"id":11365595,"kids":[11365846,11365984,11365752,11366214,11366421,11366671,11366320,11365849,11366856,11365973],"score":170,"time":1458999252,"title":"Launching the Electronic Frontier Alliance","type":"story","url":"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/03/launching-efa"},{"by":"dalerus","descendants":4,"id":11365584,"kids":[11365885,11365601,11365837],"score":3,"text":"Hey Everyone,<p>I&#x27;ve just finished my taxes for 2015 and after reviewing all my accounts I had an interesting thought.

Rather, after having worked on the app so long we&#x27;ve lost a certain sense of clarity, and would appreciate some fresh eyes and outside opinions.<p>The app itself (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getchowderapp.com) is a collaborative restaurant finder, and came about after many frustrating incidents trying to decide where to eat with my girlfriend (usually something along the lines of &quot;What do you want to eat?&quot; – I don&#x27;t mind – &quot;Do you want pizza?&quot; – No – &quot;How about seafood?&quot; – No – &quot;Then pick somewhere!!&quot;). A friend and I had some fun developing an app to try and ease the friction of making food decisions when out in a group. It&#x27;s a little like Tinder for food, only you&#x27;re matching restaurants, not people, with your friends.<p>When we initially did our market research, we were aiming solely at indecisive couples who had troubles picking places to eat because they were overwhelmed with options, but later realised that there was a much wider audience and shifted our focus to groups of friends. However, while we&#x27;ve had plenty of people respond with &quot;Huh, neat idea&quot; when we pitched it as an app for groups, I feel like it resonates much more strongly with people when pitched as an app to &#x27;help couples decide where to eat&#x27;. When pitched as the latter, we got responses where people explicitly mentioned having this problem with their SOs, as opposed to the former where it was maybe more like &#x27;Cool idea, I could see people using this&#x27;.<p>Given our incredibly limited budget and lack of funding, I&#x27;m beginning to think it might make more sense to focus on couples first and expand from there.

Of course I still have things to learn, but I feel very comfortable with most of the coding tasks that come up at work.<p>I&#x27;ve enjoyed programming since pretty much the beginning (BASIC on ancient Apple II&#x27;s in school :) but lately I&#x27;ve been feeling a bit &quot;bored.&quot; Most of my day to day coding work is around domain specific business logic and data modeling. There isn&#x27;t much that feel like inventing something new, or applying &quot;computer science.&quot; In-so-far as there are &quot;computer science&quot; challenges, like &quot;How do we handle X amount of requests per second?&quot;, those challenges are quickly and easily solved by using a pre-built DB&#x2F;library.<p>I&#x27;ve been browsing job advertisements (South Bay Area), and nothing seems to catch my interest.

If you are currently working as a developer, would you ever consider changing tracks to become an SDET - a developer who doesn&#x27;t work on front-facing code, but instead works on test code, internal tools, and does exploratory and computer-aided testing?\n-----<p>I&#x27;m in the unenviable position of trying to hire an SDET(http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.jobvite.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;animoto&#x2F;job&#x2F;oWhy2fwx). It&#x27;s not easy.<p>Most of the applications you generally get for an SDET job (certainly in my experience in NYC, this may be different nearer to Redmond) are:\n* Test Automators - people with experience writing automated tests, often in a proprietary scripting language. \n* New college grads who are just looking for anything with coding\n* Developers who don&#x27;t really care about testing and want to get their foot in the door.<p>Now, any of those could work out great as an SDET if hired, but what I always hope for is someone with experience working as a <i>Developer focused on Test</i>, or even a Developer who genuinely wants to make the switch to SDET.<p>Of the SDETs that I&#x27;ve talked to, I&#x27;ve found that most wouldn&#x27;t rule out the possibility of doing some other kind of front-facing dev work, but I can&#x27;t remember ever meeting a developer who would go the other way. SDETs are rare and getting rarer!<p>If you search for &quot;SDE to SDET&quot; (just like that, with the quotes) all of the results you get back are STILL about switching from SDET to SDE! Apparently it&#x27;s unheard-of to move in the other direction.<p>So I&#x27;m curious; if you wouldn&#x27;t want to work as an SDET, why not?

I work on my ideas myself, but I know that execution (marketing, sales, strategy, etc.) are as important as the product itself, and those are the things that I am lacking.<p>Any advice?","time":1458670642,"title":"Ask HN: Why is it so hard to find a business partner?","type":"story"},{"by":"whatami","descendants":15,"id":11338571,"kids":[11339478,11340263,11339905,11339772,11339158,11339539],"score":28,"time":1458670161,"title":"Trac (YC W16) Aims to Improve on the Stopwatch","type":"story","url":"http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2016/03/22/y-combinator-startup-trac-aims-to-improve-on-the-stopwatch/"},{"by":"dcschelt","descendants":3,"id":11338595,"kids":[11342400,11341978,11341828],"score":97,"time":1458670301,"title":"Formlabs Form 2 Teardown","type":"story","url":"http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=4641"},{"by":"gjvc","descendants":5,"id":11338584,"kids":[11339119,11338882,11339253,11338626],"score":12,"time":1458670238,"title":"Badger.com is Shutting Down","type":"story","url":"https://www.badger.com"},{"by":"Osiris30","descendants":2,"id":11338552,"kids":[11339569,11341460],"score":13,"time":1458669966,"title":"Scientists Warn of Perilous Climate Shift Within Decades, Not Centuries","type":"story","url":"http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/03/23/science/global-warming-sea-level-carbon-dioxide-emissions.html"},{"by":"Dexi","descendants":2,"id":11338548,"kids":[11396436,11338624,11338587,11338585],"score":8,"time":1458669938,"title":"New Scraping and “Pipes” tool","type":"story","url":"https://dexi.io"},{"by":"Bob_Rob","descendants":24,"id":11338482,"kids":[11338754,11339988,11339364,11340627,11339693,11339867,11343267],"score":62,"time":1458669429,"title":"Can the Micro Bit inspire a million?","type":"story","url":"http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35863859"},{"by":"dontmitch","descendants":12,"id":11338434,"kids":[11339439,11339470,11339560,11340349,11339886,11340045,11339057],"score":15,"time":1458669143,"title":"Biking to work is more expensive than I thought","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/life-learning/the-economics-of-biking-to-work-ae0f15a36636"},{"by":"api","descendants":14,"id":11338424,"kids":[11339075,11339086,11338915,11338719],"score":29,"time":1458669085,"title":"Silicon: C++14 web framework","type":"story","url":"http://siliconframework.org/blog/silicon-0-1.html"},{"by":"99_00","descendants":156,"id":11338366,"kids":[11338644,11338922,11338929,11338986,11338460,11339402,11338864,11338967,11338708,11338661,11338647,11338760,11338832,11339403,11339310,11338896,11338652,11338911,11338925,11342017,11339284,11338884,11338493,11339102,11338895,11338641],"score":91,"time":1458668693,"title":"Powerful Political Forces Are Aligning Behind Minimum Income","type":"story","url":"http://nerdinvest.blogspot.com/2016/02/powerful-political-forces-are-aligning.html"},{"by":"linuxhiker","descendants":3,"id":11338316,"kids":[11339530,11338830],"score":24,"time":1458668412,"title":"Why PgConf.US, 20 years of PostgreSQL – That's why","type":"story","url":"https://www.postgresql.us/node/156"},{"by":"saks","descendants":2,"id":11338411,"kids":[11338569,11348573],"score":1,"text":"I have two offers: one from a medium sized company and one from a very large company.

At the large company I see that there is brand recognition. The downside is that the team is mostly senior developers and it moves slowly. Of course working with senior is a benefit because I will get to learn a lot.<p>At the medium sized company, there are about 200 developers. The team is mostly young so I see more visibility and a faster work environment.<p>Both have good points and bad points. Then there is also the matter of the positions.

In other words, a way to communicate to the lay users that the security audits are taking place all right, and a mechanism for them to ensure the same. This must happen if we want to avoid the next fiasco like that of linux mint. Granted that the mint fiasco doesn&#x27;t relate directly to the source audits of gnome project, but the larger question here is the importance of security audits. Had their forum software (phpBB) been audited properly, they would have surely avoided a huge loss in trust, PR and reputation.<p>Moral of the story is: &quot;Make security audits a part of the development process itself, not an afterthought.&quot;","time":1458601872,"title":"“More eyeballs == Secure code”: But is it just a theory or happens in practice?","type":"story"},{"by":"mankins","descendants":4,"id":11332869,"kids":[11333147,11333097],"score":10,"text":"Ads suck, but what else is there?

I&#x27;m in the US and have been in the industry for the past decade. I took classes at one point and did terribly, lacking motivation and being eager to return to the workforce. I spent my time there freelancing and left in the middle of the second semester, failing every class. My cumulative GPA is 2.0 at best. I can&#x27;t stand school.<p>After that I worked my way up from low-paying &quot;grunt&quot; positions to high-paying senior&#x2F;informal lead positions, delivering great results at every job. I&#x27;ve taught myself a broad range of technologies and techniques in that time.<p>Now it feels like I&#x27;ve hit my ceiling, and at 28 that&#x27;s disappointing. I&#x27;d like to be a principal, architect, or even CTO. And I don&#x27;t want to wait another ten years for the skepticism I meet at the workplace (due to the combination of a lack of education, and my youth) to evaporate. It makes it difficult to get the job done, especially when that requires the latitude to make sweeping technical decisions.<p>Places like Google and LinkedIn have recruited me in the past, only to fall silent before so much as a phone screen due to the lack of a degree. But vets whose work I respect, from BigCorps like Google and Intel, have told me I&#x27;m one of the best they&#x27;ve worked with.<p>How do I break this paper ceiling? Is it in my mind alone? Are there credible CS degrees that factor in work experience, so I could limit my laughable anguish in classroom learning? Would it even be worthwhile to pursue a degree, given my awful transcript?<p>The other paths to the jobs I want seem to require fortune (work at a very successful startup and either get acquihired into a leadership role, or get the reputation so it&#x27;s a foregone conclusion) or serious sacrifice (heavy OSS development outside of work, but I already give 100% to my day job). I already dismissed one such gift-horse, unable to relocate overseas when a BigCorp was going to hire me as a senior during an acquisition.","time":1458490613,"title":"Ask HN: I'm a “successful,” uneducated programmer.

Looking at the accuracy of the touch panel, doesn&#x27;t look very practical as an input device, but it could be fun as a remote display if setup correctly. Perhaps some sort of dashboard running on the RPi. You could even set it up to connect to multiple Raspberry Pi&#x27;s by using one of the ESP&#x27;s GPIO&#x27;s to to select one. The video refresh rate looks bad, I guess because I couldn&#x27;t find a way to setup hextile encoding with TightVNC. If you looks at his original demo video running the XVNC server on a Linux box, it looks much smoother (20-25fps). Overclocking the ESP to 160MHz might help too.<p>Finally, this library is an entrant in the 1st Annual ESP8266 Design Contest.

Needless to say, my app has not made that sort of splash.<p>I know it&#x27;s always a matter of luck, but I really would like to know if there&#x27;s something missing from my presentation. Is it my website? The visual design of my app? The copy I send to editors? Poor screenshots? Or maybe the core idea of the app is just not appealing to the mass market? As a solo developer, all I have to rely on is my taste — and that&#x27;s a very fallible resource!

I was hired by a major California company 6 months ago to work on a project that is now about 3&#x2F;4 finished. Deadlines are fast approaching and I have an important role on the team and project. In short they are relying on me and not finishing this project would not be good for the team or company. In my free time I&#x27;ve been working on a side project with a single other person who recently closed a quite large seed round. Enough to work on it for a couple years, hire a number . The side project has no product overlap, I used my own machines and never used company time to work on this.<p>My cofounder, while ok with it, thinks that me staying with the big company is a risk to the startup because the company could make a claim despite us playing it by the book (again no product overlap, no company hardware, etc) and they think I should probably leave immediately.  I will eventually do this but I feel bad leaving my company in a bind. I do care about these people. I could use some advice.

We recently decided to tackle the problem of Capacity Planning with Stacktical, a Scalability Prediction service (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stacktical.com).<p>For a decade, we&#x27;ve been observing our clients and colleagues trying to nail down their strategy using repeated cycles of defining, collecting and interpreting load testing campaigns. \nIt&#x27;s funny how most people don&#x27;t realize how demanding the work of infrastructure managers and their teams really is...<p>While we&#x27;ve made great progress in the field of Continuous Delivery (we&#x27;re huge Docker fans for instance), getting actionable scalability metrics remains a daunting process that is far from being streamlined. \nIt has a ginormous operational cost that defies one of the main purposes of scalability: the ability for a company to fit the increasing and decreasing computing needs of apps so accurately that it never under or overspend its hosting budget.<p>We think we can do a better job by leveraging predicting technologies to do most of the heavy lifting involved in answering the question &quot;Will my application scale?&quot;.<p>To do just that, Stacktical can generate a Scalability report with tons of useful insights within seconds, using just a dozen load testing metrics. For example, we can tell you how many max concurrent users your application infrastructure can handle before starting generating bad performance (or being down altogether!) due to the fundamental penalties any server is subject to (serialization, bad inter-processus communication, suboptimal caching etc).<p>Our prototype is up and running at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stacktical.com and we&#x27;re looking for people willing to try out our solution and help us getting ready for primetime.<p>Can you guys give us a hand on that regard?\nYou can signup for our private beta at

Rules are important but rules that cannot be broken if needed are not worth having. \nIncluding those above. Pragmatism should always prevails.<p>The ideas is that this requires the right people who can actually work under those\nconditions but when found, I believe they would like this arrangement to continue \nand will contribute just the best of their productivity to make this a success. \nI also think hiring should be done on as needed basis and not to accommodate some \ngrandiose dreams of uber growth or without a solid requirement for the role.<p>What do you think?

They seem to work.<p>On Reddit&#x2F;MacRumors&#x2F;other forums, people keep telling how productive they are with their iPads, how great they are and they prefer iPads over MBPs.<p>---<p>Yes, iOS is butter smooth, it&#x27;s crisp, the virtual keyboard is usable. But isn&#x27;t a real keyboard, a touch pad, a mounted screen paired with an appropriate OS still the state of the art of an user interface?<p>- A touch pad keeps finger and arm movement to the minimum; a track point (which is not popular) even more; whats so great about touching UI elements? Yes, scrolling content or pinching to zoom from time to time might be more intuitive but <i>still</i> you can do this on a good trackpad with less finger and arm movement and <i>as</i> intuitive<p>- Regarding the keyboard, tablets are catching up. There&#x27;re keyboards, control + alt keys are available but is this not even more a proof that a keybaord is essential and they&#x27;re reinventing the wheel?<p>- The software and the OS, every piece of software there&#x27;s limited. An iPad Word can just open one document at a time and most UI is touch based. I know that most people do need just some browsing, Gmail and Facebook but once you want to do a bit more serious stuff you pull out your notebook?<p>- Media consumption, people write that iPads are so great for media consumption; my 10&quot; notebook is way better for media consumption since it has its stand built-in and I don&#x27;t have to hold it, I can even turn it by 90 degrees and it keeps standing rock-solid; <i>and</i> it plays torrents<p>So, is it me or them who don&#x27;t get it? I am seriously thinking of getting an iPad to force myself to work with an iPad 2, 3 weeks to understand people&#x27;s fascination.","time":1457861043,"title":"Ask HN: Am I getting old?","type":"story"},{"by":"jswt001","descendants":448,"id":11276798,"kids":[11276826,11276905,11277077,11277423,11276914,11276871,11277692,11276815,11278862,11278988,11276818,11277026,11276847,11279139,11276994,11276841,11276955,11276903,11276889,11276820,11277295,11278870,11276832,11277032,11277647,11278320,11277047,11277034,11277514,11278026,11276873,11278598,11277657,11282970,11287075,11277051,11276932,11276819,11279501,11276846,11281622,11279117,11279052,11278866,11276845,11278526,11276829,11276842,11277419,11280104,11277110,11277864,11276814,11276828,11276979,11276813,11278091,11277532,11279268,11279753,11278283,11277523,11276833,11279266,11277235,11278889,11277474,11277058,11277473,11277224,11277086],"score":1395,"time":1457858677,"title":"Lee Sedol Beats AlphaGo in Game 4","type":"story","url":"https://gogameguru.com/alphago-4/"},{"by":"pkrumins","descendants":4,"id":11276797,"kids":[11276840,11277206],"score":72,"time":1457858667,"title":"Lee Sedol beats AlphaGo in game 4 (result is now 1-3)","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCALyQRN3hw&hn=true"},{"by":"prostoalex","descendants":24,"id":11276644,"kids":[11277169,11277346,11277464,11277125,11277453,11277429,11277475,11277143],"score":45,"time":1457854747,"title":"Facebook is eating the world","type":"story","url":"http://www.cjr.org/analysis/facebook_and_media.php?utm_source=pocket&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=pockethits"},{"by":"cdcro","descendants":3,"id":11276663,"kids":[11277997,11277027],"score":17,"time":1457855489,"title":"Diablo II released over 15 years ago gets a new patch","type":"story","url":"http://www.techspot.com/news/64078-years-later-blizzard-releases-new-diablo-2-patch.html"},{"by":"aharonovich","descendants":5,"id":11277075,"kids":[11277774,11280057,11279859,11277173,11277180],"score":3,"text":"After the cricket bars company raised significant capital I started thinking, why won&#x27;t most people eat insects?","time":1457863402,"title":"Ask HN: Would you eat insects?","type":"story"},{"by":"cdubzzz","descendants":4,"id":11276940,"kids":[11279834,11278887,11277712,11281160],"score":17,"time":1457860566,"title":"Show HN: Rogue AI Dungeon, javacript bot scripting game","type":"story","url":"http://bovard.github.io/raid/"},{"by":"TravelTechGuy","descendants":17,"id":11276322,"kids":[11276493,11276517,11276467,11276519,11276474,11276524],"score":24,"time":1457845683,"title":"Microsoft hits new low – sneaks Win 10 ads into IE security patch","type":"story","url":"http://betanews.com/2016/03/09/windows-10-advertising-in-ie-security-patch/"},{"by":"FjordPrefect","descendants":5,"id":11276241,"kids":[11277106,11276340,11276320,11277082,11276596,11276736],"score":11,"text":"With the massive progress AI research has made, a world where a computer can do anything a human can do, but better, doesn&#x27;t seem far away.<p>Seeing AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol made me both excited and anxious.<p>What role would humans play in such a future?","time":1457844014,"title":"Ask HN: Human role in an AI World","type":"story"},{"by":"PascLeRasc","descendants":32,"id":11276221,"kids":[11276535,11277182,11276610,11277418,11277369,11277518,11276699,11277166,11277638],"score":79,"time":1457843638,"title":"How FPGAs work, and why you'll buy one (2013)","type":"story","url":"https://www.embeddedrelated.com/showarticle/195.php?1"},{"by":"simonebrunozzi","descendants":5,"id":11276120,"kids":[11276330,11276136],"score":3,"text":"The beloved dog of a friend went missing hours ago, in San Francisco.

All of the leaked information exposes thousands of clients including owners of: BuyCraft, RamNode, Spigot, MC-Index, Zenoscape and even the KKK which exposes members of the community. The KKK alone are tagged as a terroist organization. Both Staminus, and Intreppid are completely shot to the ground and thousands of clients are furious.

I work on everything for the front end. This means: 7 different Rails apps (internal &amp; external), 5 different Rails engines, ~10 in-house built gems, and I also delegate work to 2 folks under me as a tech lead for a new project.<p>According to Payscale.com (including perks, etc):\n  - Boston rankings: 38th percentile @ 84k&#x2F;year\n  - Where I live&#x2F;work remotely: 75th percentile @ 84k&#x2F;year<p>I continue to pick up more and more responsibilities, yet the &#x27;cap&#x27; for raises is 10%. I&#x27;m at a point where I know I can find work that pays more, yet I do not have another offer. I&#x27;m currently interviewing with Google though, so maybe that gives me a leg-up?<p>Anyway, what merits do I have for a raise? Where I live&#x2F;work vs. where the company is based, my ranking is drastically different. Yet, it&#x27;d still be cheaper for the company to give me a hefty raise rather than finding someone with my skill sets in Boston (RoR devs in Boston are super expensive and hard to find, so I feel like I&#x27;ve been taken advantage of).<p>How can I go about asking for a raise? My plan is to gather different estimates from different websites for both areas and then come up with a solid middle-ground for the pay that I&#x27;m looking for. Without another job offer on the table, it&#x27;s hard to demand anything; however, I know that my company needs me more than I need them (not going into details here).<p>Just looking for some opinions and thanks in advance for any advice given here :)","time":1457622570,"title":"Need a raise, how to ask?","type":"story"},{"by":"ystrot","descendants":4,"id":11259692,"kids":[11261375,11259868],"score":5,"time":1457623518,"title":"Sweet Eclipse","type":"story","url":"http://exyte.github.io/sweet.eclipse/"},{"by":"tzipis","descendants":27,"id":11259330,"kids":[11259954,11259923,11259350,11260123,11259522,11260460,11261671,11260889,11259374,11263943,11259676,11260155],"score":58,"time":1457619888,"title":"How we were building the wrong product","type":"story","url":"http://kilometer.io/blog/how-we-were-building-the-wrong-product-for-the-last-10-months/?ref=news.ycombinator.com/newest"},{"by":"martincmartin","descendants":64,"id":11259392,"kids":[11263505,11261816,11263075,11261853,11261886,11263644,11262468,11265769,11262705,11262796],"score":93,"time":1457620537,"title":"The future of computing: After Moore's law","type":"story","url":"http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21694528-era-predictable-improvement-computer-hardware-ending-what-comes-next-future"},{"by":"bischofs","descendants":2,"id":11259353,"kids":[11260099,11259834],"score":4,"text":"Working on a scheduling problem - I have heard of  neural networks being used for this problem domain but wasn&#x27;t sure TF covered this domain.","time":1457620115,"title":"Ask HS: can TensorFlow be used for combinatorial optimization problems?","type":"story"},{"by":"uyasinov","descendants":5,"id":11259206,"kids":[11260803,11261300,11260804,11259742],"score":36,"time":1457618570,"title":"Using React Instead of Dijit with Dojo Toolkit","type":"story","url":"http://10clouds.com/blog/using-react-instead-of-dijit-with-dojo-toolkit-part-1/"},{"by":"selmat","descendants":2,"id":11259134,"kids":[11262830,11273905],"score":2,"time":1457617691,"title":"Ask HN: What is your recommended binary file editor","type":"story"},{"by":"hmate9","descendants":2,"id":11259275,"kids":[11271401,11259483],"score":3,"time":1457619265,"title":"Ask HN: Where/How can I find trending CS research papers?","type":"story"},{"by":"sonabinu","dead":true,"id":11258923,"kids":[11259173,11259158],"score":10,"time":1457615338,"title":"Every Parents Nightmare","type":"story","url":"http://nytimes.com/2016/03/10/opinion/every-parents-nightmare.html?_r=0"},{"by":"tim333","dead":true,"id":11258833,"kids":[11261591,11260223],"score":2,"time":1457613929,"title":"Video reveals the moment Google's self-driving car slams into a bus","type":"story","url":"http://www.zdnet.com/article/video-reveals-the-moment-googles-self-driving-car-slams-into-a-bus/"},{"by":"internetwache","descendants":36,"id":11258770,"kids":[11259207,11258868,11258919,11259320,11258938,11259132,11258804,11259074],"score":102,"time":1457612965,"title":"Hacking with LaTeX","type":"story","url":"https://0day.work/hacking-with-latex/"},{"by":"myggan","descendants":2,"id":11258887,"kids":[11259187,11258979],"score":3,"time":1457614821,"title":"IT security game.

am a CS student currently working full time and I develop some side projects for my entertainment. One area that could really use attention is graphics design &#x2F; art. For example, I am looking to slap together a wireframe of a project to make a proposal, but it looks quite bare, so I&#x27;d really like to get some mock-up art or basic logo design done.<p>As I&#x27;m not a digital artist, nor do I have the time to try some basic art myself, how would you recommend finding someone to offer concept art, keeping in mind these constraints:<p>- This is not a full-time paid position, just a side-project<p>- I am a college student with not much money to spare<p>My first thought was to use sites where one posts a request for art and provides a budget, and artists across the internet can &quot;bid&quot; on the project by submitting samples.

It completely freed up my time, and I spent that time in part realizing that coding and running a software startup aren&#x27;t really my passion.<p>I decided my real passion is sex, as well as passive income, so I started a porn startup, with me directing and acting in my own films. I made three films so far, and revenues from each film are growing film-to-film. The high costs of a shoot, however, still mean that I&#x27;m in the red, and I actually subsidize my costs with my bartending day job. The sole revenue model is selling the films on clip sites as downloadables.<p>I don&#x27;t naturally look the &quot;type,&quot; so mainstream work has been hard to find, but I have the technical capability to do the job. A startup is the way forward for me. Eventually, my goal is to build enough content to sell monthly memberships, much like SaaS startups.<p>I&#x27;m getting a little burnt out doing so much at once (i.e. writing, directing, producing, acting, editing, marketing, etc.), and I still haven&#x27;t figured out distribution apart from my 13k Twitter followers and 1,000-strong organic mailing list. It has also been hard being so frugal just to save up for monthly shoots. I feel like I have to pump out fresh content with regularity to please my customers, who, though are numerically few at the moment, are pretty loyal in purchasing film after film.<p>I suppose what I&#x27;m asking is, how can I maximize the revenue potential of my startup?

I used a site called 2Checkout in the past but my experience was horrible. I lost a good amount of money with them because their fraud detection is very poor, and customer support is even worse.<p>4.

We have over a hundred CPAs signed up, we&#x27;ve gotten great positive feedback from our early users, and we&#x27;re now working on getting the word out to a wider audience. However, given that our market is highly constrained by the looming April 18th US tax deadline, we need advice on what we could be doing to maximize the time we have. Specifically, we wanted to ask two things:<p>- Usability&#x2F;conversion optimization. If you look at our content, would you be interested in using Taxaroo (assuming you wanted professional tax help)? If not, what are one or two major hangups that would give you reason to hesitate? We&#x27;ll be doing in-person usability testing in the coming days, but your feedback would be very valuable.<p>- Reaching customers. We&#x27;re a bootstrapped company, and given we don&#x27;t have a large advertising budget, what avenues would you use to find customers? We&#x27;ve aggressively pursuing press, but with virtually no press relationships we&#x27;ve not had any major success.<p>Thanks for looking!<p>Background:<p>Our Show HN post: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11074466<p>Our mission is to make taxes as simple and painless as possible so that people can get back to doing things they actually want to be doing. Taxaroo allows people to have their taxes prepared by an experienced certified professional, at prices lower than a tax office, and all without even leaving home. Everything is done securely on our online platform, and we can even give instant quotes so people know what they will pay up front (which is impossible at most tax offices). The end result is that clients save hours of time and hassle compared to going into an office, and save nearly $100 on average. We already have well over a hundred CPAs from across the country signed up to start preparing returns, and they can handle taxes from every U.S. state!<p>Thanks,\nTim\nCo-founder &amp; CTO","time":1457093122,"title":"Ask HN: Advice needed on our startup, a professional tax preparation marketplace","type":"story"},{"by":"moks","descendants":53,"id":11223266,"kids":[11223290,11223794,11223675,11225665,11224183,11224658,11223616,11223781,11223455,11223930],"score":122,"time":1457093866,"title":"ECDSA Key Extraction from Mobile Devices via Nonintrusive Physical Side Channels","type":"story","url":"https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/230"},{"by":"trymas","descendants":5,"id":11223213,"kids":[11228320,11229174,11228686,11228081],"score":63,"time":1457093061,"title":"How to design a Linux kernel interface [video]","type":"story","url":"http://mirror.as35701.net/video.fosdem.org/2016/janson/how-to-design-a-linux-kernel-api.mp4"},{"by":"z3phyr","descendants":10,"id":11223103,"kids":[11224925,11223807,11223409,11227585,11223888,11226740],"score":53,"time":1457090978,"title":"Modern textureless deferred rendering techniques","type":"story","url":"https://forum.beyond3d.com/threads/modern-textureless-deferred-rendering-techniques.57611/"},{"by":"kercker","descendants":72,"id":11223096,"kids":[11223371,11224727,11223457,11223294,11224082,11223957,11223804,11224336,11225068,11224333,11225650,11225042,11223503,11225552,11224911,11223310,11223886,11224844],"score":392,"time":1457090914,"title":"Go by Example","type":"story","url":"https://gobyexample.com/"},{"by":"pmlnr","descendants":69,"id":11223032,"kids":[11223220,11223680,11223394,11223324,11223224,11223237,11223329,11223405,11223386,11223281,11223689,11223268,11223207,11223222,11223305,11223198,11223231,11223380,11223529],"score":37,"time":1457089635,"title":"Paywalls coming to medium.com: “We're building monetisation”","type":"story","url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35709680"},{"by":"obeattie","descendants":74,"id":11223033,"kids":[11223625,11224609,11224094,11224556,11223657,11223926,11223943,11224011,11223922,11224418,11225176,11224700],"score":83,"time":1457089636,"title":"Startup bank Mondo raised £1m crowdfunding in 96 seconds","type":"story","url":"https://getmondo.co.uk/blog/2016/03/03/crowdfunded/"},{"by":"mgav","descendants":12,"id":11223007,"kids":[11223465,11224471,11223453,11224394,11224012],"score":116,"time":1457089135,"title":"The Startup Stock Tracker","type":"story","url":"http://graphics.wsj.com/tech-startup-stocks-to-watch/"},{"by":"lihaoyi","descendants":69,"id":11222967,"kids":[11227942,11228115,11228459,11228477,11228619,11228282,11228325,11228902,11228517,11230107,11228487,11228920,11229298,11229669],"score":113,"time":1457088191,"title":"What's in a Build Tool?","type":"story","url":"http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/WhatsinaBuildTool.html"},{"by":"obfuscatedgeek","descendants":33,"id":11222957,"kids":[11223303,11223000,11223547,11227137,11229734,11236642,11223313,11237350,11228147,11223518,11223459,11223272,11223633,11234595,11223668,11223025,11246802,11223575,11223225,11228701,11224034,11225516,11224003,11223264,11225364,11225040,11233836,11225583],"score":17,"text":"So my company decided to try out the Scrum working methodology and hired an external consultant to get in order.

We need to intelligently manage our time.  We tried many different task managers, but none of the existing solutions answered our demands. That is why we decided to create a task manager, which will satisfy all our needs. The idea became a challenging task for us, since on the one hand, we wanted our to-do app to be a full-fledged task manager, and on the other – we needed a solution that is very simple and easy to use. Another important thing we kept in mind while designing our task manager is that just a quick glance at the main screen should give you an idea of how important a task is. After a series of brainstorming sessions, we created our unique main screen – the funnel, where each task is shown as a bubble and the task importance is represented by the bubble size, the bigger the bubble the more important is the task to be done. The title To Round reflects the concept of a task manager where tasks are represented as bubbles.<p>We quickly developed the prototype, and after just a few months our web app went live! We were the first to use the app, then we told about it our friends, they shared with their friends and so on. The result was a viral effect, and several thousand people registered on our website in the next few days after the release. Our first users left us comments and gave us kind advices on how to improve To Round. At first, we made To Round just for ourselves, but we were so touched to find out that people really do like it, that we decided to continue developing the product. In the summer of 2015, we managed to attract a private investor, which gave us additional resources and allowed to expand the team, launch the Telegram bot, and release iOS and Android apps that our devoted users waited for.<p>Now for us important know your opinions. So, please use visual task manager To Round in the case and share your opinion with us. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;to-round.com","time":1456933778,"title":"How we turned a hobby into a dream

been using Atlassian JIRA for project management for months now, both in my personal projects and at work. I&#x27;m forced to still use it at work but I really want to minimise the need to use it as much as possible.<p>This is why I&#x27;m looking for an alternative to JIRA.<p>Main features I use :\n    - Scrum&#x2F;Agile basics (boards, estimates, sprints)\n    - The ability to create epics (I really like this)\n    - Timetracking (timesheets)<p>I&#x27;ve been using Confluence for wiki pages but seriously I will not miss it one bit. I think any wiki tool is better.<p>Why I don&#x27;t like JIRA anymore:<p>I just think this product is a joke. I mean sure the core features are very good, which is probably why I signed up in the first place but, loading time is still slow. People complained about this few years ago I don&#x27;t see that anything has changed. I&#x27;m on a cloud instance and seriously pages take 8-9 seconds to load.<p>I was trying to restore my account on a new instance and it doesn&#x27;t work. I cannot backup again because there is one backup per user every 50 hours.<p>Atlassian wants to be a solution for all your problems. This is why they have few other products besides JIRA, all of which are horrible. They should really focus only on performance which is making their main product impossible to use.<p>rant over. If you have suggestions for products that have basic scrum&#x2F;agile stuff and time tracking I would love to hear about them :)<p>thank you","time":1456848722,"title":"Need a good alternative for Atlassian JIRA","type":"story"},{"by":"crufo","descendants":2,"id":11203577,"kids":[11210281,11206525],"score":10,"time":1456848619,"title":"How This Developer Beat Out Facebook on GitHub's Top Trending List","type":"story","url":"http://www.andela.com/blog/how-an-andela-developer-beat-out-facebook-on-githubs-top-trending-list/"},{"by":"mtufekyapan","descendants":4,"id":11203534,"kids":[11224621,11205209,11205133,11205437],"score":6,"time":1456848341,"title":"(Slide) Latest UI Trends and Best Practices","type":"story","url":"http://www.slideshare.net/UXAlive/2015-ui-trends"},{"by":"amibendavid","descendants":8,"id":11203330,"kids":[11203535,11203611],"score":8,"time":1456847024,"title":"This man used a clever trick to find out what users really thought of his app","type":"story","url":"http://thenextweb.com/insider/2016/02/29/this-man-used-a-clever-trick-to-find-out-what-users-really-thought-of-his-app/"},{"by":"adventured","descendants":78,"id":11203308,"kids":[11203628,11203591,11203909,11207642,11204688,11203430,11203774],"score":67,"time":1456846921,"title":"Why China’s Economy Will Be Hard to Fix","type":"story","url":"http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-changing-chinese-economy/"},{"by":"shawndumas","descendants":66,"id":11203183,"kids":[11204002,11203466,11204192,11203949,11205649,11203596,11203770,11207325,11204231,11203655,11208646,11209293,11207958,11203745,11206271],"score":130,"time":1456846143,"title":"Performance of ES6 features relative to ES5","type":"story","url":"https://kpdecker.github.io/six-speed/?utm_source=ESnextNews.com&utm_medium=Weekly%20Newsletter&utm_campaign=Week%2010"},{"by":"mblakele","descendants":17,"id":11203063,"kids":[11204618,11204553,11203974,11216994,11204235,11204044],"score":28,"time":1456845223,"title":"Google's self-driving car crash is a positive sign","type":"story","url":"http://ideas.4brad.com/googles-crash-very-positive-sign"},{"by":"jjude","descendants":150,"id":11203056,"kids":[11204188,11203576,11204520,11204254,11204512,11203282,11203902,11203488,11204704,11203389,11203736,11203701,11203618,11205090,11204669,11203496,11203796,11203279,11204528,11204351,11204158,11203500,11205868,11204551,11208074,11204760,11204677,11203502,11203821,11203829,11204777,11203871,11206899,11204764,11204815,11205442,11206191,11206256,11206169,11204432,11205422,11256718,11209002,11204998,11204586],"score":323,"time":1456845195,"title":"Mandrill’s Betrayal","type":"story","url":"http://www.dangrossman.info/2016/02/28/mandrills-betrayal/"},{"by":"chewymouse","descendants":34,"id":11203030,"kids":[11203554,11203913,11204373,11203435,11203544,11203883,11203925,11203675,11203652,11204746,11203325,11203589,11204004],"score":68,"time":1456845022,"title":"An iPhone Is an Extension of the Mind","type":"story","url":"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2016/02/apple_and_the_fbi_think_iphones_are_safes_a_philosopher_explains_what_they.single.html"},{"by":"alyssoncm","dead":true,"id":11202953,"kids":[11204654,11203057,11203041],"score":19,"time":1456844443,"title":"Parse migration: the first real automatic wizard migration on back{4}app","type":"story","url":"http://blog.back4app.com/2016/03/01/quick-wizard-migration/"},{"by":"whoishiring","descendants":84,"id":11202955,"kids":[11206009,11203089,11206482,11223130,11229826,11203114,11271015,11203376,11203059,11208130,11203281,11206336,11203241,11203808,11203843,11204418,11204828,11226588,11206741,11210452,11203891,11206181,11222829,11211826,11204784,11210307,11206320,11217244,11203046,11204400,11203720,11227931,11214087,11206833,11241050,11220021,11204396,11209129,11206824,11209742,11203914,11203002,11212748,11228353,11273065,11203397,11204505,11209280,11205156,11206055,11275098,11206588,11205339,11203242,11279133,11209158,11258450,11204595,11204989,11209084,11208180,11247250,11264781,11220176,11210338,11236939,11203605,11206295,11203905,11203033,11218921,11238056,11222304,11203103,11224504,11206002,11204867,11210303,11220213,11203742,11209337,11204848,11222940,11206076,11204859],"score":53,"text":"Please lead with either SEEKING WORK or SEEKING FREELANCER,\nyour location, and whether remote work is a possibility.","time":1456844448,"title":"Ask HN: Freelancer?

was looking for a good CRM and Salesforce seemed like the unquestioned leader.<p>We’ve had a meeting with a sales rep in their luxurious offices at the foot of the Eiffel tower.\nDespite 2 hours of phone interview before, the sales rep had no understanding of our business and the product demo was extremely disappointing.<p>The platform is not user friendly at all and the transition to the new ‘lightning experience’ makes it even more terrible, forcing the user to go back and forth between the two interfaces and to cope with outdated documentation.<p>They have a large number of complex solutions with as many different pricing plan and limitations, a closed platform, no big enthusiasm around the community, a high pricing (130€&#x2F;user&#x2F;month for the sales product only). They claimed to be the “most innovative company in the world” but want customers to sign a 24-month contract. They do not provide any help in setting up the platform. And I could keep going…<p>To me it seems that Salesforce is buying growth by investing heavily on sales and very little in product development. The only benefit of Salesforce over its competitors comes from its monopoly position. Salesforce remains the only platforms to have integrations with the software we use (integrations which they did not develop themselves of course).<p>I had a quick look at their financial statements which reassured my opinion: negative earning, growing capital surplus, growing goodwill… In the annual report, the company is fond of separating out &quot;non-GAAP&quot; earnings to show adjusted positive income. But the reality is that long periods of GAAP losses means the company should not be worth 46$Bn.<p>In the SaaS industry ‘fast eats big’.

(I&#x27;m guessing that the most attainable goal for this project would be teaching them how to create and customize a Wordpress site, but more ambitious suggestions are welcome).","time":1456622666,"title":"Ask HN: teaching basic coding and web design offline, solely via iOS devices?","type":"story"},{"by":"miolini","descendants":4,"id":11189182,"kids":[11190410,11191970],"score":45,"time":1456619873,"title":"Concurrent Tries with Efficient Non-Blocking Snapshots (2012) [pdf]","type":"story","url":"http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~prokopec/ctries-snapshot.pdf"},{"by":"ApplaudPumice","descendants":21,"id":11189163,"kids":[11189409,11189233,11189210,11189247,11189267,11189237,11195751,11189292,11189167,11191057,11189198,11190709,11189184],"score":15,"time":1456619511,"title":"Does anybody find this Scheme code readable?","type":"story","url":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pratyakshs/Che.ss/master/check.ss"},{"by":"doener","descendants":3,"id":11189108,"kids":[11189258,11197611,11189297,11192890],"score":13,"time":1456618271,"title":"Clinton received more money from weapons makers than all other candidate","type":"story","url":"https://twitter.com/RaniaKhalek/status/701526694683926528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"},{"by":"batz","descendants":77,"id":11189234,"kids":[11189571,11189538,11189604,11189464,11189796,11191192,11189438,11189675,11189427,11189668,11189700,11189642,11189679,11189527,11189995,11190966,11189577,11190718,11189782,11189686,11189669,11189515,11189275],"score":78,"time":1456620931,"title":"Engineers of Jihad: Connection between Violent Extremism and Education","type":"story","url":"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10656.html"},{"by":"bootload","descendants":5,"id":11188968,"kids":[11189348,11189578,11190409,11189461,11189805],"score":6,"time":1456615329,"title":"Harvey Mudd College: Increasing women in CS from 10 to 40% in 5 years","type":"story","url":"https://backchannel.com/at-harvey-mudd-college-the-ratio-of-women-in-cs-increased-from-10-to-40-in-5-years-4bb72e909fbd"},{"by":"56k","descendants":80,"id":11188937,"kids":[11189454,11189298,11189230,11189217,11189691,11189468,11189497,11189262,11189488,11189319],"score":37,"time":1456614783,"title":"Why hasn't functional programming taken over yet?","type":"story","url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20150519053755/http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2835801/why-hasnt-functional-programming-taken-over-yet/2835936"},{"by":"cedricr","descendants":6,"id":11188852,"kids":[11189513,11192063,11188895],"score":27,"time":1456613232,"title":"“Maybe jobs are for machines, and life is for people”","type":"story","url":"http://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2016/02/24/robots-will-take-your-job/5lXtKomQ7uQBEzTJOXT7YO/story.html"},{"by":"shreyassaxena","descendants":14,"id":11188846,"kids":[11190387,11195398,11204579,11189439,11188919,11189365,11190364,11191314,11189651,11189510,11192049,11190522],"score":5,"text":"Facebook has a great interview question:\n&quot;On your very best day at work — the day you come home and think you have the best job in the world — what did you do that day?&quot; \nI am curious how would HN members respond?\nSource: Oliver Emberton","time":1456613113,"title":"Ask HN: Facebook interview question","type":"story"},{"by":"stesch","descendants":54,"id":11188751,"kids":[11189011,11189107,11189277,11189124,11189310,11188959,11189010,11189151,11189445,11193902,11189382,11189351,11189872,11189149,11189072,11189694,11189349,11189125,11188981,11189753,11189273],"score":84,"time":1456611144,"title":"An engineer replaced four monitors with Meta glasses","type":"story","url":"http://www.businessinsider.de/meta-glasses-could-be-future-of-work-2016-2?r=US&IR=T"},{"by":"CraigJPerry","descendants":16,"id":11188679,"kids":[11189736,11188933,11189585,11188930,11189115],"score":81,"time":1456609707,"title":"Cleanflight Flight Control Software","type":"story","url":"http://cleanflight.com"},{"by":"whizzkid","descendants":9,"id":11188698,"kids":[11189020,11188821,11189844,11190735,11188817,11192901],"score":12,"text":"I am seeing unbelievable amount of blog posts, releases, upgrades about Javascript frameworks and libraries during the last 12 months.

I was on board at the first day, with the other founders, and before any execution on ideas had begun.  By most yardsticks, this would make me a founder.  I&#x27;m a technical one (engineer), and yet I&#x27;m treated as an employee, with 3% equity, and stock that vests over 3 years.  Just to get this, I had to push pretty hard and negotiate with the CEO and COO.<p>I&#x27;ve gone back recently to try to change the equity share I get, as I understand that most founders on board when I was typically receive anywhere from 10 to 30%.  The CEO tells me that I&#x27;m the only one with any kind of agreement, and that makes me far better off (?!).  Apparently, no one else has anything in writing.  When I ask the CEO about this, he not only seems to hint that people will be very tied to the company (executives will have a 6 year vesting schedule...what?), but he seems to think that if anyone gets any equity now, it will turn off investors.  He wants to maintain majority control in the company so no investors can come along and &quot;steal&quot; it from him, AND he wants to set aside a monstrous chunk of equity for these investors.  He hints that employees will get some &quot;down the road&quot;, but that this is an effective way to get investment.  He tells me I&#x27;m too &quot;9 to 5&quot; security focused (which, honestly, I do tend to be.  I&#x27;m working at a full time &quot;real&quot; job while doing this near full time).<p>He keeps telling me that I need to trust him and that he&#x27;ll reward people down the road based on their performance.<p>I&#x27;m all for tying incentives to actual performance, but this is just so loosely defined.<p>Am I being overly rigid not trusting this guy while proving my worth?  The more I read, the more it seems this is a bogus deal.  Is there any merit to this idea that having employees with equity will turn off investors?<p>Does this make any kind of sense, or am I completely a chump?<p>Thanks","time":1456464479,"title":"Ask HN: Am I getting hosed by a CEO?","type":"story"},{"by":"NN88","descendants":46,"id":11179895,"kids":[11186070,11186238,11186632,11186570,11186220,11186084,11186339,11186884,11186696,11186404,11186952,11186292,11186120],"score":57,"time":1456463260,"title":"Liberal, Harsh Denmark","type":"story","url":"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/03/10/liberal-harsh-denmark/"},{"by":"rocky1138","descendants":10,"id":11179877,"kids":[11189542,11189554,11179881,11192452,11190800,11192453],"score":26,"time":1456462699,"title":"Show HN: Super Markup World","type":"story","url":"http://supermarkupworld.daggasoft.com/"},{"by":"Perados","descendants":27,"id":11179780,"kids":[11185059,11184865,11185384,11185310,11184834,11185193,11185927,11184794,11184913,11186793,11184911],"score":56,"time":1456460537,"title":"The quest to solve “Unfavorable Semicircle”, a mysterious YouTube channel","type":"story","url":"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160225-the-quest-to-solve-youtubes-strangest-mystery"},{"by":"prostoalex","descendants":4,"id":11179868,"kids":[11186861,11186345,11186281],"score":10,"time":1456462485,"title":"How Driverless Cars Can Reshape Our Cities","type":"story","url":"http://www.curbed.com/2016/2/25/11114222/how-driverless-cars-can-reshape-our-cities"},{"by":"m00dy","descendants":22,"id":11179842,"kids":[11180364,11181096,11180738,11180386,11180232,11181097],"score":71,"time":1456461981,"title":"BloomFilter Experiments","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/erenyagdiran/BloomFilter"},{"by":"jarsin","descendants":41,"id":11179703,"kids":[11181661,11181210,11179936,11180160,11181200,11181208,11180846,11180555,11184140,11182817,11182283,11181256,11182232],"score":109,"time":1456458888,"title":"Codex: A Legal Scripting Language for Ethereum","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@PaxDirectory/codex-a-legal-scripting-language-e3723cc76662#.7z4xebqmi"},{"by":"skreuzer","descendants":9,"id":11179591,"kids":[11180616,11180094,11180245,11182991],"score":76,"time":1456455950,"title":"Yahoo Webscope: a reference library of interesting and useful datasets","type":"story","url":"http://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/"},{"by":"signa11","descendants":54,"id":11180170,"kids":[11180513,11180279,11180313,11183302,11180361,11180286,11180758,11183091,11180415,11181238,11180288,11180876,11180396,11181294],"score":189,"time":1456469780,"title":"Erlang: Pi2 ARM Cluster vs. Xeon VM","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@pieterjan_m/erlang-pi2-arm-cluster-vs-xeon-vm-40871d35d356#.uj7dm7a5a"},{"by":"apsec112","descendants":59,"id":11179497,"kids":[11185577,11185628,11185625,11187339,11185582,11185833,11186143,11187255,11185963,11185500,11187082,11186940,11185618,11186768,11186249],"score":142,"time":1456454289,"title":"Academic Drivel Report: Confessing my sins and exposing my academic hoax","type":"story","url":"http://prospect.org/article/academic-drivel-report"},{"by":"frenchhoudini","descendants":30,"id":11179371,"kids":[11179930,11180579,11179661],"score":134,"time":1456451872,"title":"Etheropt, a decentralized options exchange built on Ethereum","type":"story","url":"http://etherboost.github.io/etheropt/testnet"},{"by":"samstave","descendants":3,"id":11179355,"kids":[11179474,11179419],"score":2,"text":"there is no good reason to timeout both editing and deletion of comments.

there!<p>Over the past month I built a service that allows you to see your users browse your website &#x2F; web app in real time. It&#x27;s kinda like &quot;session recording&quot; offered by various services, but live, mainly to offer support.<p>To make it easier to market I built a Chrome extension that integrates it with Intercom and other live chat services, so that when someone chats you up you can see their screen live and troubleshoot problems a lot quicker. Some early users utilize it this way.<p>However, I personally like a lot more the idea of having a &quot;monitor&quot; with say 6 screens and being able to send a message to people you see struggling, to offer &quot;proactive&quot; support.\nThis comes from seeing way too many of my users on other apps make dumb mistakes and seeing myself losing money after they leave frustrated. I would <i>really</i> have paid to send them a message on screen saying &quot;hey, let me know if you need help with this :)&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not sure whether:\n1. this &quot;proactive support&quot; is creepy;\n2. it is scalable;\n3. it only works in my mind;\n4. companies would pay for it;\n5. the ease of marketing something &quot;for intercom&#x2F;livechat&#x2F;...&quot; outweighs the coolness of the monitoring station.<p>What do you guys think?

I am about to graduate from a university in 3 months with a Computer Science degree and am already experiencing pains trying to decide what to do next. I generally did well in all the disciplines, from Operating Systems to Security to AI and so on. But since you don&#x27;t delve deeply into any topics while at university, I am left confused in what I would actually like to specialize in later on.<p>Currently, I work for my university developing their app, and have good skills in front-end in general. However, there seems to be a lot more interesting niches out there such as data science, robotics, embedded programming.<p>But before I make full jump into any of these new areas, I would like to test them all out and get a better feeling of what I might like doing best for the next decade or so.<p>Do you think spending a year learning from MOOCs, creating own personal projects is a good idea? Or would it perhaps be better to find work immediately, or find some really good internships? The problem with finding work is that with my current skills I am not confident I would be able to get the job in the niche I might want to try out. This is essentially what the year would be spent on, researching different niches, trying out some personal projects and then pursuing the needed skills to get a job in the niche that really catches my interest.<p>Any input is highly appreciated!

Anything to do with building a calendar in the software. People will always want it to be &quot;like outlook&quot; or to do something their existing calendar program does. While this is a lovely thing to want, it is a major endless development pit for a small company with limited resources - the needs of each individual in a calendar&#x2F;scheduler are so unique and specific. Syncing is another can of worms ...<p>2. Importing data from Excel spreadsheets. Assuming we can deal with various file versions and read the data, the problems with dates, leading zeroes, commas, formatting and inconsistencies are insane. Excel is great for ad-hoc data manipulation, calculation, and presentation, but for pure data storage and import ... not so much.<p>3.

You&#x27;re now able to choose your cleaner and read their past reviews BEFORE booking to increase the likelihood you&#x27;ll find a cleaner you love.<p>2&#x2F; Super convenient - Booking online takes 60 seconds.  And, after booking, we give you a direct phone line with your cleaner.  Once you&#x27;ve completed your first cleaning, we make sure you ALWAYS get the same cleaner back upon request.<p>3&#x2F; Affordable as ever - Homeaglow cleaners set their own hourly rates. We only work with independent cleaners which translates into low rates and cost savings.<p>I&#x27;d love to invite you to check out our site, book a cleaning, and most importantly, I&#x27;d love to get your feedback on how we can make the service better.<p>Thank You!\nAaron Cheung\nHomeaglow, Co-founder<p>P.S.

So far things have been very good, so good in fact that we&#x27;re quickly growing out of our current infrastructure. Last christmas everything went crazy and the, then only developer, rewrote a bunch of things to make it scale better.<p>Currently we write away every single transaction to txt files and once every X minutes gather those and start inserting them into 2 Mysql shards. After that we run a bunch of group by queries to generate cross table reports. Currently our CMS is very limited by this, you can only view data relations in the predefined tables and we would like to have (a lot) more flexibility here.<p>Perhaps the biggest issue of all is that both I and the other developer do not have experience with handeling this much data. We both have worked on systems which handle a fair bit of data, but not nearly as much as this. We&#x27;ve been looking at MapReduce for MongoDB but already run into problems when we try to insert a weeks worth of data, which is about 350gb, because we only get so many IOPS at AWS. If we want more IOPS, it gets really expensive really fast. We&#x27;re also not entirely sure yet if MongoDB and MapReduce is the way to go.<p>What I&#x27;m looking for is a few pointers to help us get headed in the right direction.

couple of years ago I was about to become redundant and blanket uploaded my CV onto a number of job boards, including Monster.co.uk.<p>I quickly found a role by applying to a company directly and set my account on a number of CV sites (including Monster) to private. This is the current state of my profile. All other profiles I have across job sites have either been removed or disabled in this way.<p>Fast forward 2 years and I received an email today from a recruiter with the stock &quot;your CV out of date, I am keen to talk to you&quot; blurb. Usually this would go straight in the bin, I get about 10 of these a week so this isn&#x27;t anything new.<p>This email however was part of a chain, and the recruiter had accidentally (I assume) forwarded me an email from a company called Logic Melon with a header saying:<p><i>You requested the details for &lt;MY NAME&gt; (from Monster). The C.V. should be attached as it was downloaded. Please find the details below.</i><p>Underneath this were details of my email address, mobile phone number, current location and date the profile was last updated.<p>What it looks like is that a recruiter has paid a third party service to retrieve my CV it scraped from Monster in 2014 and get my contact details. Contact details that shouldn&#x27;t exist in the open.<p>I&#x27;m already fairly prejudiced about software recruitment firms from numerous run-ins with them in the past, so my natural response is to feel this is pretty shady behavior but should I be feeling so uncomfortable about this?<p>I understand that placing my personal details on a job board would have resulted in everyone and their mother being able to read and save it, but I didn&#x27;t really think that my CV and personal contact details would have been archived and continued to be used by recruiters long after I disabled my account. I disabled my account as an indication that I was no longer looking for work, contacting me in this way is fairly blatantly ignoring this preference.","time":1456169498,"title":"Ask HN: Is this recruitment tactic shady?","type":"story"},{"by":"joajoa","descendants":21,"id":11153481,"kids":[11155851,11155893,11154513],"score":75,"time":1456168815,"title":"An update on strong mode","type":"story","url":"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/strengthen-js/ojj3TDxbHpQ"},{"by":"evo_9","descendants":25,"id":11153432,"kids":[11154228,11154838,11153795,11154067,11155237,11153818],"score":97,"time":1456168432,"title":"The Synthesizer Academy","type":"story","url":"http://synthesizeracademy.com/"},{"by":"chippy","descendants":88,"id":11153406,"kids":[11156801,11158433,11156609,11154734,11156482,11156465,11153413,11156496,11154104,11157816,11157575,11157581,11157479,11156905,11157669,11154379,11157242],"score":132,"time":1456168197,"title":"Toki Pona: A created language that has only 100 words","type":"story","url":"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/07/toki-pona-smallest-language/398363/"},{"by":"jonbaer","descendants":38,"id":11153396,"kids":[11155139,11154314,11154320,11156526,11153629,11154319,11154823,11157072,11158229,11157908,11153605,11155112],"score":183,"time":1456168080,"title":"Graphene becomes superconductive","type":"story","url":"https://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/news/research/graphene_becomes_superconductive.html"},{"by":"tefo-mohapi","descendants":10,"id":11153380,"kids":[11154160,11153592,11154334,11153500],"score":3,"text":"Serious question, given rulers like Uganda&#x27;s Museveni who have been president for decades and yet living conditions haven&#x27;t improved for citizens.","time":1456167941,"title":"Can Open Data Keep Politicians in Africa Accountable?","type":"story"},{"by":"whittlbc","descendants":7,"id":11153326,"kids":[11154150,11154579,11155004,11154036,11153737],"score":14,"time":1456167532,"title":"Sourcehoney – Before Show HN: Open Source Idea Network","type":"story","url":"http://www.sourcehoney.com"},{"by":"cgopalan","descendants":23,"id":11153300,"kids":[11154097,11155943,11155221],"score":69,"time":1456167346,"title":"Visual C++ Compiler Optimizations (2015)","type":"story","url":"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn904673.aspx"},{"by":"mthomasb","descendants":40,"id":11153187,"kids":[11153398,11153832,11154095,11155366,11155041,11153715,11155414,11153623,11156839,11154248,11153863,11156262,11154142,11153656],"score":102,"time":1456166542,"title":"Show HN: Bonsai (YC W16) – bulletproof contracts and payments for freelancers","type":"story","url":"https://www.hellobonsai.com/"},{"by":"manglav","descendants":7,"id":11153274,"kids":[11153439,11156247,11154327,11153372,11154687,11157208,11162179,11154689],"score":7,"text":"I&#x27;m working on a computer vision&#x2F;machine learning project that could benefit from some guidance.

If I handle it like in the example, I would need to recompile the application if I give roles access to methods for which they were previously not authorized (if it is not possible to just assign the user to a higher role).<p>In previous hobby projects I solved this with permission&#x2F;activity based authorization, where users are assigned roles, and permissions are assigned to roles. The checks within the application are against the permissions not the roles, and can be changed without recompiling the application. If a role needs new permissions just assign it in the backend, if a specific user needs new permissions it&#x27;s possible to create a new role with appropriate permissions etc.<p>But how do I handle more complex permissions like this? \n- Superadmin can delete everyone except himself.\n- Admins can delete all users but not themself or other admins.\n- Manager can only delete users that he manages but not himself.","time":1456157463,"title":"Ask HN: What are the best practices for web authorization at the moment?","type":"story"},{"by":"oinkgrr","dead":true,"id":11151661,"kids":[11151806,11151791],"score":2,"time":1456156657,"title":"The man who made 'the worst video game in history'","type":"story","url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-35560458"},{"by":"xyclos","descendants":2,"id":11151626,"kids":[11152072,11152581],"score":5,"time":1456156479,"title":"Apple Has Already Won.

my most recent stint at Microsoft just didn&#x27;t work out. The tech was cool, but the day-to-day workflow was tedious and torturous. I only held out for 4 months - my shortest gig ever, but it really was the most I could muster. I really wanted it to work, but ultimately couldn&#x27;t strike that bargain with myself.<p>So... now I&#x27;m back to living on couches and wondering &#x2F; researching where I might still be able to be useful and productive in the world. It&#x27;s not an easy question. There are more technology stacks than ever, and I&#x27;m suffering very severe paradox of choice. I sure miss the &quot;good old days&quot; when you just focused on writing a single app in C that ran on a well-understood machine, or even a single well-understood OS API. But those days are mostly gone. Now it&#x27;s all distributed, multi-level conglomerates of varied frameworks and languages sort-of working together. I can&#x27;t decide whether I have any interest in that. I sort of envy the people who can simply state, &quot;I am a Rails dev&quot; or similar.<p>I feel a lot of pressure to pick a niche. Something. Anything. Because living on couches gets old, fast, and even more dire financial straits await after that. So I&#x27;m being driven by the stick, and not the carrot - which is an unpleasant position.<p>I found a great game (on Steam) called TIS-100, where you progress by writing small, well-defined programs in assembly language, for a strange, highly constrained imaginary processor. It&#x27;s great for its pure distillation of machine-level programming. There was a time when people used to get payed for doing what you do in this game.

I need a way to organize that volume of bookmarks to be able to fish out all links on a specific topic or those that are relevant to my current work.<p>So I’m looking for a super-efficient solution that would not draw away my attention from the actual content during day-to-day use. I tried Pocket, Readability, and Instapaper. They all share the same drawbacks.<p>First, when you decide to read something and you open the original link (because the images or the video are missing or the formatting has been removed), you have to go back to the list and archive your bookmarks. There’s no option to open the original link and archive the bookmark in a single click. (OneTab has this, but it doesn’t support tagging very well.)<p>Second, most articles are actually coming from a relatively small set of websites. Sometimes I want to sort all bookmarks by domain and open those from a couple of specific websites. Other times, I want to assign a tag to a whole domain, so that the tag would be automatically applied to all bookmarks from that domain, both existing and future.<p>Carefully tagging every link individually feels like a waste of time.

guys so I worked on this SaaS since 09. I&#x27;ve made probably 10k since then. Pathetic, yup. it took about 3 years to develop a mature product out but seems like there&#x27;s just more and more SaaS charging cheaper and cheaper and there&#x27;s just no more people that are sane as in they understand how much value they are getting but unwilling to pay for it (they can&#x27;t).It seems that my product failed because I ended up catering and attracting people who didn&#x27;t appreciate the value it brought them. There was just another guy around the corner who would heoretically do it for cheaper.So after 100k lines of code...I&#x27;m finally thinking of shutting down the Saas and I just had a super depressive period where I was in a full state of panic. I&#x27;m letting go of my 20s in it&#x27;s entirety. I&#x27;ve sacrificed so much for so little in gain and it&#x27;s so fucking depressing.<p>I just don&#x27;t know where to begin at the colossal failure my SaaS has been. What was once a great source of pride and hope is now a standing evidence of my inability, my failure, my lack of skill. And as a result, I&#x27;ve thought about this in another thread before, and I&#x27;ve thought about it again, I should not be in technology. I have found a wonderful chance to be working at a new startup but I just can&#x27;t for the love of god come back after pulling off kamikaze shit like this (my grandpa was one so shit runs in the blood) and just throwing away everything so I can build what I thought was ideal in this world and thoroughly rejected.<p>I&#x27;m 30 now and I&#x27;m living the alternate universe that I desperately wanted to avoid. I want to be intoxicated but I can&#x27;t afford to. Literally, it feels like anything I start or do is going to fail by some divine will. Is this the wall of destiny that people run into? When you try so fucking hard and it&#x27;s still not good enough. What do you do then? What could you possibly do after spending so long and sacrificing so much for something so inevitably irrelevant in life?","time":1456051311,"title":"Tell HN: Man, I quit","type":"story"},{"by":"jackgavigan","descendants":81,"id":11143937,"kids":[11144143,11144161,11144503,11144221,11144139,11144535,11144168,11144125,11144365,11144152,11144280,11147748],"score":31,"time":1456048138,"title":"What happens when you pour molten aluminium into an anthill?","type":"story","url":"http://anthillart.com"},{"by":"sdogruyol","descendants":16,"id":11143811,"kids":[11146492,11154185,11146598,11146642,11147942,11149078,11146757,11148289,11148156,11146615],"score":54,"time":1456043938,"title":"Kemal: Fast, simple web framework for Crystal","type":"story","url":"http://kemalcr.com/"},{"by":"stockkid","descendants":2,"id":11143739,"kids":[11144614,11143743],"score":4,"time":1456041441,"title":"Show HN: Editer – a high level multi-line string manipulation in Node.js","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/sungwoncho/editer"},{"by":"lifeisstillgood","descendants":14,"id":11143716,"kids":[11146763,11146743,11146693],"score":43,"time":1456040936,"title":"Number of species on Earth estimated at 8.7M (2011)","type":"story","url":"http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110823/full/news.2011.498.html"},{"by":"kyloren","descendants":6,"id":11143682,"kids":[11144483,11145834,11146656],"score":13,"time":1456039888,"title":"Show HN: Pomodoro in Your Terminal","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/rukshn/pomodoro"},{"by":"prostoalex","descendants":214,"id":11143588,"kids":[11144123,11143928,11144097,11144359,11144418,11144830,11144520,11144677,11143876,11147446,11143892,11146579,11145237,11145371,11144058,11144160,11145253,11145107,11145004,11144931,11143990,11143926,11144001],"score":249,"time":1456036782,"title":"Washington Should Prepare for Saudi Arabia's Collapse","type":"story","url":"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/02/saudi-arabia-collapse/463212/?single_page=true"},{"by":"8sigma","descendants":12,"id":11143468,"kids":[11143541,11143837,11144897,11143485,11143778],"score":4,"text":"If &quot;inventiveness&quot; can be described as a skill,how can anyone acquire it?","time":1456033449,"title":"Ask HN: How do i become inventive?","type":"story"},{"by":"etalam","descendants":10,"id":11143442,"kids":[11143759,11143466,11143648],"score":8,"time":1456032665,"title":"Petition to eliminate marriage penalty for dual-career couples","type":"story","url":"https://petitions.whitehouse.gov//petition/reform-tax-code-eliminate-marriage-penalty-which-disproportionately-hurt-dual-income-families"},{"by":"elithrar","descendants":70,"id":11143423,"kids":[11143869,11144386,11144761,11143574,11143977,11144065,11143665,11143522,11145599,11143638,11143829,11143623,11143783,11143781,11143640],"score":200,"time":1456032100,"title":"Vapor: a type-safe web framework for Swift","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/tannernelson/vapor"},{"by":"lolptdr","descendants":61,"id":11143377,"kids":[11145055,11143804,11143554,11143695,11143549,11143600,11144549,11144958,11143584,11144943,11165951,11144051,11144631,11147540,11144892,11145870,11144832,11144692,11144254,11143620,11143696],"score":70,"time":1456030970,"title":"Descartes – An experimental library for writing CSS in JavaScript","type":"story","url":"https://descartes.io/"},{"by":"mrdassani","descendants":2,"id":11143368,"kids":[11143396,11143992],"score":7,"time":1456030692,"title":"Google Ratings has a Windows server loading page","type":"story","url":"https://survey.googleratings.com/"},{"by":"rkda","descendants":75,"id":11143326,"kids":[11144314,11143901,11144879,11143768,11143559,11143391,11144863,11143754,11191532,11146088,11143860,11143683,11143881,11146089],"score":247,"time":1456029518,"title":"Discover Flask","type":"story","url":"http://discoverflask.com/"},{"by":"retupmoc01","descendants":9,"id":11143250,"kids":[11145201,11145139],"score":19,"time":1456027590,"title":"Thousands of goats and rabbits vanish from major biotech lab","type":"story","url":"http://www.nature.com/news/thousands-of-goats-and-rabbits-vanish-from-major-biotech-lab-1.19411"},{"by":"danbolt","descendants":17,"id":11143317,"kids":[11143599,11152673,11143737,11145210,11151501,11150061,11150063,11143539,11143355],"score":11,"text":"C++ is a behemoth of a language, and it can be surprisingly difficult to find two programmers that agree on the same subset of it to be best when developing software.<p>As a recovering C# programmer, I&#x27;m getting back into C++ and really enjoying the new features of C++11&#x2F;14.

I&#x27;m at my friends place, and I&#x27;ve completely wiped my iPhone (it&#x27;s gone).

At a full-time capacity, I’d be looking to pay a base salary of around $30-40k with health benefits.","time":1455691424,"title":"How much commission to pay salesperson for selling Consulting Services?","type":"story"},{"by":"deathtrader666","descendants":8,"id":11115497,"kids":[11118216,11116768,11117804,11117625,11122907,11116023,11116133],"score":19,"time":1455686158,"title":"The New Adobe ColdFusion","type":"story","url":"http://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2016/02/the-all-new-adobe-coldfusion-is-here.html"},{"by":"RaSoJo","descendants":215,"id":11115423,"kids":[11115873,11115615,11115967,11115836,11115905,11115851,11115772,11115972,11115715,11115684,11121056,11116277,11115893,11117686,11116117,11115644,11115866,11115737],"score":258,"time":1455685017,"title":"China's Subprime Crisis Is Here","type":"story","url":"http://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2016-02-17/china-s-600-billion-subprime-crisis-is-already-here"},{"by":"danielam","descendants":84,"id":11115420,"kids":[11117102,11116971,11117896,11117945,11117086,11117125,11117079,11119309,11115632,11120922,11116637,11116755,11117046,11118304,11121387,11120473,11118179,11120795,11120801],"score":257,"time":1455684950,"title":"Polish codebreakers 'cracked Enigma before Alan Turing'","type":"story","url":"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/12158055/Polish-codebreakers-cracked-Enigma-before-Alan-Turing.html"},{"by":"Perados","descendants":2,"id":11115228,"kids":[11116229,11115665],"score":18,"time":1455682271,"title":"Immunotherapy could bring cancer treatment breakthrough [video]","type":"story","url":"http://www.bbc.com/news/health-35585571"},{"by":"mehrdadn","descendants":6,"id":11115310,"kids":[11115318,11118375,11156762,11118014],"score":44,"time":1455683497,"title":"10M former California students' SSNs/medical records/etc. being disclosed [pdf]","type":"story","url":"http://www.cde.ca.gov/re/di/ws/documents/form2016jan26.pdf"},{"by":"abruzzi","descendants":28,"id":11115319,"kids":[11120194,11118954,11117624,11117815,11117093,11120393],"score":68,"time":1455683586,"title":"As Marijuana Sales Grow, Startups Step in for Wary Banks","type":"story","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/17/business/dealbook/as-marijuana-sales-grow-start-ups-step-in-for-wary-banks.html?hpw&rref=business&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=well-region&region=bottom-well&WT.nav=bottom-well"},{"by":"vinchuco","descendants":5,"id":11115144,"kids":[11115532,11117748,11115946],"score":91,"time":1455681210,"title":"SciHub – Pirated Research Papers","type":"story","url":"http://www.sci-hub.io/"},{"by":"prawn","descendants":2,"id":11115277,"kids":[11115375,11115374],"score":2,"time":1455682894,"title":"How Kimoji Onboards New Users","type":"story","url":"https://www.useronboard.com/how-kimoji-onboards-new-users/"},{"by":"acidfreaks","descendants":10,"id":11115110,"kids":[11115153,11117348,11115177,11133421,11115222,11115235],"score":11,"time":1455680711,"title":"Ask HN: What was your longest time you've spent debugging a single bug?","type":"story"},{"by":"yagnaumsys","descendants":3,"id":11115037,"kids":[11116308,11115986,11115179],"score":5,"time":1455679725,"title":"Welcome to the batteryless, wireless world of the IoT","type":"story","url":"https://eengenious.com/welcome-to-the-batteryless-wireless-world-of-the-internet-of-things/"},{"by":"olalonde","descendants":3,"id":11114986,"kids":[11115008,11126365],"score":9,"time":1455678881,"title":"Show HN: Show HN Chat","type":"story","url":"https://discord.gg/0piovD3zkjwdotzl"},{"by":"aerovistae","descendants":14,"id":11114955,"kids":[11117194,11118281,11115963,11132803,11117688,11131370,11118297,11124432,11116153],"score":33,"text":"I was looking at this quora question[1] in which an individual is 23 and makes 300k on Wall Street as a developer.

It could be useful as a quick first pass interview to see if your candidate knows how to use the command line.<p>3) Support.

They refused to talk to me. I scheduled a court hearing, which the hospital’s attorney decided to ignore. The court investigated, decided that my girlfriend was being unlawfully detained, and ordered the hospital to release their patient. I made a few minor mistakes in my execution of the court hearing and implementation of the court’s ruling. After calling the police for help, I was attacked by the hospital’s security guards. Eventually I learned that they lied to the responding officer when he appeared, which is why I was arrested.<p>It took me two days to meet with a lawyer, who prepared a template for a motion to amend the court’s order. By then it was too late: my girlfriend had been sucked into the system.<p>I “read the documentation” (statutes) and hacked the hospital’s usual procedures, but minor mistakes kept me from successfully keeping my girlfriend out of the mental health system. She needed some help, but is not benefiting from the “treatments” forced upon her.<p>Initially I wanted to draw public attention to the plight of everyone who’s stuck in the system. But someone I respect said, “the missionaries get eaten by cannibals”.<p>To quote ESR: “Hacking favors scrap-and-rebuild over patch-and-extend. An essential part of hacking is ruthlessly throwing away code … no matter how much time you have invested in it.”<p>The mental health system is not going to fix itself: Obamacare pays the bills, and the patients are generally incapable of standing up for themselves.

am working on a Single Page Application (SPA) using Angular 1.5 and while I have spent a lot of time building it, I keep reading about various &quot;issues&quot; regarding javascript frameworks in general. To be specific, I am building the server side API as well as the front end, so I have a lot of freedom to adjust both sides as much as needed (which can be good and bad).<p>I feel like a SPA style app works well with the use case of the site I have been building in that we are making it easier for our customers to find their information in the shortest amount of time possible (think Google for product support).<p>With that said, I have a bias towards this design choice because I built it. I know that I might be missing something and I want to consider more use cases than what I can come up with.<p>What I want to know is when does it make sense to use a more traditional server-client architecture? I had read about Twitter reverting back from a SPA to server rendering, but I feel like their use case was specific to their needs or to a specific metric and possibly user experience for their site (lower time to first tweet, smaller page load, and cleaner URL&#x27;s).<p>I am aware of SEO drop with Angular, but I feel like problems like clean URL&#x27;s, back button not working, and UI thrashing are fairly solveable by good planning (in the case of the URL&#x27;s) and Web Workers (to address UI Thrashing).<p>I chose Angular because I was already very familiar with it and I found it to be fairly flexible for what I need it to do, it just needs some nudging at times (ng-if vs. ng-show&#x2F;hide). Also, at the time, I couldn&#x27;t get the JSX tooling for React to work properly and I think Babel couldn&#x27;t do transpiling for the latest version of React at that time (I think it was around 1.4). I had used Mithril which was a huge joy and very powerful, but the way my site works (it&#x27;s an Oracle product using PHP&#x2F;CodeIgnitor), I couldn&#x27;t get the client side routing to work properly.","time":1455578012,"title":"Ask HN: What are the common pitfalls/problems of Single Page App's?","type":"story"},{"by":"samclemens","descendants":17,"id":11106716,"kids":[11108031,11109190,11107990],"score":39,"time":1455577261,"title":"Proposals Toward the End of Writing","type":"story","url":"http://logger.believermag.com/post/138988654268/proposals-toward-the-end-of-writing"},{"by":"dicemoose","descendants":9,"id":11106843,"kids":[11107011,11107361],"score":7,"time":1455578677,"title":"Why C Students Are More Successful After Graduation","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/life-learning/10-reasons-why-c-students-are-more-successful-after-graduation-e5287760525f#.1uqt7k1jo"},{"by":"jjxw","descendants":62,"id":11106637,"kids":[11107188,11107266,11107036,11107115,11107120,11107111,11107232,11107310,11107084,11107940,11107264],"score":37,"time":1455576367,"title":"Basic Income: Unintended Consequences","type":"story","url":"http://jonthewang.com/2016/02/15/basic-income-unintended-consequences/"},{"by":"aresant","descendants":14,"id":11106636,"kids":[11107484,11106771,11107031,11107760],"score":23,"time":1455576352,"title":"What is it like making around $130k in Sunnyvale, California as an engineer?","type":"story","url":"https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-making-around-120K-130K-in-the-US-in-Sunnyvale-California-as-a-software-engineer/answer/Danielle-Lan?share=1"},{"by":"curtis","descendants":57,"id":11106589,"kids":[11110794,11110850,11111856,11110932,11114443,11111403,11112103,11110739,11113888,11112634,11113018,11112625,11111747,11112567,11112130,11111639,11110845,11111202],"score":74,"time":1455575911,"title":"Sony launches universal remote control with e-ink screen","type":"story","url":"http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/tech-news/sony-huis-remote-control-e-ink-11364040192256"},{"by":"ausjke","descendants":4,"id":11106574,"kids":[11106628,11106588,11106585,11107553],"score":3,"time":1455575810,"title":"Model Minority perfect for scapegoat?","type":"story","url":"http://savepeterliang.org/"},{"by":"tapp","descendants":49,"id":11106677,"kids":[11109749,11109484,11109338,11109093,11111069,11109577,11109558,11110471,11112329,11112156,11109226],"score":93,"time":1455576865,"title":"Ransomware takes Hollywood hospital offline, $3.6M demanded by attackers","type":"story","url":"http://www.csoonline.com/article/3033160/security/ransomware-takes-hollywood-hospital-offline-36m-demanded-by-attackers.html"},{"by":"ohjeez","descendants":54,"id":11106458,"kids":[11109222,11111234,11110512,11109096,11109202,11109823,11109561,11110135],"score":105,"time":1455574554,"title":"Why Modern Makers Are Bringing Back Ham Radio","type":"story","url":"https://www.yahoo.com/tech/why-modern-makers-are-bringing-1363811879927862.html"},{"by":"Xcelerate","descendants":6,"id":11106403,"kids":[11106712,11106678,11106651,11109260,11107534,11107533,11107876],"score":4,"text":"I&#x27;m curious where the HN crowd in particular would want to live if cost or job opportunities were no obstacle.

We wrote it, tested it, then put it up on a website. Life was good. I worked mostly with C&#x2F;C++ at that time.<p>My career was stellar during those years. I was young and getting promoted super fast. With a limited scope of tech, I could dive into it and learn a lot quickly. Whenever I joined a company or switched teams, I became a &quot;go to&quot; person that people sought for help. I felt motivated to learn and deepen my knowledge.<p>Then everything started moving to the web. Any piece of software was written in at least a dozen languages and frameworks. Then came package managers, and package managers within package managers. Dependency hell.<p>I just can&#x27;t keep up with things anymore. I learn the basics and do my job, but I feel I can never get a good grasp on things. Years ago I felt like I knew what I was doing. I had a mental model of things and I could reason about them down to assembly level. But now, applications are spread over different languages, tools, frameworks, plus everything is distributed, in a way I can&#x27;t build those mental models anymore.<p>Whenever I look at the mess of technologies that seem part of every app today, all I can see is complexity. Things seem to optimize for &quot;coolness&quot; instead of maintainability, simplicity and stability. People love frameworks built atop layers of complex and often flaky software, but don&#x27;t realize that all that abstraction makes it hard to debug an app when something goes wrong.<p>I estimate I spend 80% of my time dealing with:<p>- Broken dependencies<p>- Figuring out how to integrate components A and B, which weren&#x27;t written to be compatible with each other<p>- Waiting for some remote server to come back up so things will work again<p>- Rewriting code because some new X framework is supposedly better<p>I&#x27;m getting burned out by this.

It works out really well with server side code, since there is test coverage and with build automation, feature branches get merged into development branch as soon as they are tested ok. Unlike mobile development, since the changes are live as soon as you wish to (no time to deploy apart from build and testing), you can quickly test if there are any bugs in code you pushed and quickly make changes. So this workflow works out really great for server side development. However we are facing issues with mobile development with this workflow.<p>Now there are two major issues that we are facing with this workflow. One is that suppose we merged some feature into development and later figured out that there are lot of bugs in it. Now it can’t be pushed further, whole development cycle is stuck because that code is already merged with development. This is the reason we started forking feature branches from master rather than development as at least individual feature branches will have fully working code. One way is that each feature can be separately distributed to team members to test and only then will be merged to development but it&#x27;s very cumbersome<p>Another problem is since base code with every feature branch is from master branch and it has to be merged with development, there are lot of conflicts. Earlier when we used to fork from development, we used to regularly merge development branch with feature branches so there were no conflicts but can’t do that anymore. So now to fix conflicts, we create another temporary branch from feature branch with which we merge dev code, fix conflicts and put that as pull request which is again little cumbersome.<p>Is there a better workflow for mobile development that people have adopted or even some practices that can be followed to solve these problems?","time":1455453142,"title":"Git workflow for mobile development","type":"story"},{"by":"antitamper","descendants":281,"id":11097994,"kids":[11098126,11098464,11098311,11098125,11098290,11098067,11098783,11098158,11098069,11098095,11099335,11098090,11098134,11098186,11098245,11098068,11098080,11098260,11099429,11098114,11098092,11098122,11098074,11099156,11098220,11098640,11098326,11098188,11098239,11098100,11098140,11098154,11098656,11099478,11098839,11099090,11098136,11100940,11098405,11098611,11099019,11098149,11098206,11098172,11098111,11098137,11098550,11098450,11098089,11099496,11098475,11099147,11098205,11098103,11098534,11098295,11098389,11098211,11098351],"score":289,"time":1455452026,"title":"Why I don't like smartphones","type":"story","url":"https://www.devever.net/~hl/smartphones"},{"by":"vmorgulis","descendants":5,"id":11098084,"kids":[11098088,11111464,11098532,11104671],"score":40,"time":1455454882,"title":"Tutorial of Nulan – Lisp with Pattern Matching, Hygienic Macros and More","type":"story","url":"http://pauan.github.io/nulan/doc/tutorial.html"},{"by":"tobik","descendants":3,"id":11097952,"kids":[11099577,11098433],"score":22,"time":1455451087,"title":"Holistic Configuration Management at Facebook","type":"story","url":"http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2016/02/holistic-configuration-management-at.html"},{"by":"aprdm","descendants":3,"id":11097806,"kids":[11099805,11097865,11097819],"score":3,"text":"More and more start ups tend to over emphasise how they&#x27;re the coolest company in earth, that they&#x27;ve drinks, ping pong tables and etc. etc. etc.<p>And then the question comes, why us?

We offered this person a reasonable package (equity vested into, severance, keep benefits, etc) and he verbally agreed.<p>A couple days later, we were served a demand letter from this person&#x27;s high priced litigator demanding that his full equity be vested immediately.<p>Due to unfortunate lawyering nonsense, the company is not likely to have this deemed frivolous by the courts.<p>We&#x27;re now completely stuck. Our lawyers say it would cost $150,000 to fight this in court and would take 18 months. We don&#x27;t have that kind of money or time to spare.

I don&#x27;t have direct people management responsibility but I do manage team from technical aspects.

I sense mutual respect from few members of my team and almost all of business partners.<p>I want to move to management and perform role of manager.  I have talked this numerous times with my manager.  Problem is that my manager is less of technical guy and doesn&#x27;t seem like he wants to support my career growth.  He is of similar age as me.<p>What and how do I move into managerial&#x2F;director position ?<p>I am getting tired of day-to-day technical stuff where it&#x27;s your fault when smallest thing goes wrong and it&#x27;s everyone&#x27;s efforts when things go right.  There is also great degree of undercutting happening from equal senior members of my team.  I don&#x27;t want to be manager of my own team but moving in Org is not feasible due to internal politics anytime soon.<p>TBH, it seems that managers&#x2F;directors have less and less work I have seen in multiple companies I worked for.  All they do is preach &#x2F; talk and present.  I am not making gross generalization but it seems that manager&#x2F;director job has far more security than being tech lead.<p>I was not born in US but I studied all my life in English.   I don&#x27;t sound like  an american when I talk. People understand me fine though.

recently read an article [1] that was about how to validate a business idea on the cheap (both time and money). The article was well-written, and the business this individual started seems to be going well.<p>In a nutshell, the author was seeking to answer two questions. The first was trying to assess whether there was a potential market for the author&#x27;s idea. The second question was seeking an answer was: &quot;Will people pay enough to make this a meaningful business?&quot; It is <i>how</i> the author goes about answering the second question that concerns me here.<p>The author put up a basic web page with a simple web site with a button to order the product in question. The button actually sent the potential customer into a purchase work-flow which ends up charging their credit card. The author follows-up with an email indicating that the product is not available and offers a full refund. Some &quot;customers&quot; request this, but the majority do not. Eventually, the author ends up refunding all of the &quot;customers&quot; since the author is not able to deliver on the promise of fulfilling the order in the time frame specified in the follow-up email. I do not think the author was intentionally misleading the &quot;customers&quot; on this point. I think the author did not realize how much work would be involved in actually fulfilling that promise. It comes out later in the article that an unspecified amount of money is spent over a time frame approaching a year before they were able to deliver on the initial promise. (I do not know whether the business was able to deliver on the promise to the original &quot;customers&quot;.)<p>Is there a way to do an experiment on the cheap, that does reliably validate the business without misleading potential customers in the process?<p>[1] I debated about whether I should link to the article. I have decided <i>not</i> to.

Each year, the University pockets a large sum of government grants to &quot;educate me&quot; and then puts me to work as a TA or in a lab.<p>So what does this have to do with a free education? My concern is this: If students are subsidized then colleges will lose incentive to provide a proper education. Colleges will start to abuse their student population.

I am on the edge of life, I am even struggling to find a low wage job to support myself. I have no money at all, just a monthly pass for Muni (thankfully), a membership to a local gym where I can shower and groom everyday, and one more month of cell phone service (Google voice number just in case it goes out). I am homeless and hungry, looking for some help in my job search, either rehearsing interviewing, coding interview practice, reviewing my resume or even just tell me if I should completely give up (and find something else) because I am no good at what I do. My portfolio is lacking because the work I did at my previous company was short term websites. I have a hard time moving foward with any personal projects that might help me get a position, I struggle daily to eat, get enough sleep and stay sane as it is.<p>Regarding my situation, staying with family is not an option, they do not care, are in multiple other states, and are tapped for cash, and I&#x27;ve already asked for a lot from friends. I really need help getting on my feet and I hope the community here can point me in the right direction.

At best this is a game of whack-a-mole, but I consider it a violation of CFAA, because by removing GWX I told Microsoft I don&#x27;t want it but they reinstalled it anyway and so that is an unauthorized access.  (People have been prosecuted for much less.)<p>They are also adding what they call telemetry, but which I classify as spyware.  Spying and ads are what some people accept as a consequence of receiving free hardware or software, but I paid for my computers and licenses, so I expect my OS vendor to respect that.<p>It&#x27;s not necessary or useful to debate me on these issues.  These are my current opinions, and until I learn otherwise I intend to manage my systems accordingly.<p>An inadvertent or forced upgrade to Windows 10 would be catastrophic to our workflow.  Also, I will not be ceding control of my systems to unstoppable updates like we all have been forced to accept on our phones.  Therefore, I turned off automatic updating, and now I am being forced to update manually, all because Microsoft blended their threats into their security update channel.<p>Sadly, the task of reviewing each update to evaluate whether it is benign or harmful is daunting.

This is commonly anywhere between $20-40k (to me). We&#x27;ve had years where it has been zero though due to slower business. Additionally if the company were to be sold, or if I were to leave the company, the company would get a valuation and I would be paid out for my percentage. This seems like a pretty good deal to me.

works(They know what it does though, improve query performance, wow!)<p>Ask them few intermediate level sql queries to write and they would be like I did it using ORM of framework xyz.<p>Or at programming language level, I asked what singleton is, they replied correctly about what it does, but failed to answer how it works, and interestingly answer were different from &#x27;experts&#x27; of different language or framework, ROR guys said it works probably by installing gem, PHP guy attempted to write class but couldnt , javascript guys usually like &#x27;meh, I dont know&#x27;<p>Asked them about REST and all would correctly recite its verb and full form, but would fail miserably when you want to know from them what is purpose of doctype, Or how http works under the hood or sometimes they dont even know what is GET and POST.<p>I remember things were different around 10yrs back, People used to write lot of code from scratch and had less tools, I am not blaming tools or framework for it, but new gen programmer seems to be so dependent on tools that they dont even care to know about whats going on under the hood. they would just read few blogs, read tutorial of

I worked on 2 (simpler) projects as a freelancer and projects I did work fine, but I am not satisfied with them. I am sure that you all know that the point of programming is not only to make the code that works.<p>I can make things work, but I feel like they are not meant to be made like that. Basically I am a Googler.

Maybe based on bootstrap or foundation, just simpler.<p>Thanks in advance","time":1454693887,"title":"Ask HN: What's the best minimal CSS framework?","type":"story"},{"by":"imslavko","descendants":2,"id":11042801,"kids":[11060499,11042949],"score":6,"time":1454692249,"title":"Bay Area Housing Hack Guide","type":"story","url":"http://info.meteor.com/blog/housing-hack-guide"},{"by":"jokull","descendants":1,"id":11042790,"kids":[11042937,11042861],"score":16,"time":1454692144,"title":"On-Demand Platforms: Smooth supply side payments","type":"story","url":"https://blog.takumi.com/supply-side-payments-for-on-demand-platforms-1eacbcea8e77#.20xobe9ks"},{"by":"multique","descendants":1,"id":11042606,"kids":[11042905,11046928],"score":2,"time":1454690851,"title":"Infographic: Android vs. iOS Mobile App Development","type":"story","url":"https://www.cleveroad.com/blog/android-vs-ios-mobile-app-development-infographic"},{"by":"seanpk8","descendants":4,"id":11042508,"kids":[11042535,11043282],"score":6,"time":1454690110,"title":"Show HN: BlueOak Server Maximizes the Value of Swagger API for Node.js Devs","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/BlueOakJS/blueoak-server"},{"by":"dnetesn","descendants":2,"id":11042404,"kids":[11042486,11044810],"score":4,"time":1454689260,"title":"McDonald's giving away books in Happy Meals","type":"story","url":"http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/nation-now/2016/02/04/mcdonalds-happy-meals-toys-prize-books/79806266/"},{"by":"ghprndev","descendants":24,"id":11042366,"kids":[11043208,11043115,11043015,11044955,11044409,11043678,11046985,11044323,11044653],"score":49,"time":1454688923,"title":"Show HN: GitHub Notifier","type":"story","url":"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-notifier/ekjiicgclcmjodoijejldoohdlomjlhl"},{"by":"pavornyoh","descendants":56,"id":11042353,"kids":[11055390,11056260,11056188,11055284,11057151,11056971,11056654,11056462,11056673,11055483],"score":113,"time":1454688808,"title":"UC Berkeley profs lambast new “black box” network monitoring hardware","type":"story","url":"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/02/profs-protest-invasive-cybersecurity-measures-at-university-of-california-campuses/"},{"by":"sideband","descendants":363,"id":11042482,"kids":[11043768,11043234,11043232,11042909,11042838,11048002,11043466,11044968,11044460,11044168,11043846,11044225,11042750,11042851,11043312,11048945,11046724,11042919,11047055,11043940,11045096,11046399,11046435,11046642,11042828,11047760,11044033,11044062,11043433,11044267,11046607,11045992],"score":426,"time":1454689858,"title":"Tableau stock down almost 50%","type":"story","url":"http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE%3ADATA"},{"by":"danso","descendants":635,"id":11042278,"kids":[11044512,11042577,11042637,11042747,11045810,11043347,11043199,11042641,11042500,11042556,11042664,11043030,11043480,11042771,11043336,11042581,11043912,11050696,11042703,11042953,11042724,11043988,11044215,11042738,11043328,11044592,11123850,11114571,11043721,11043528,11044008,11043624,11042789,11042783,11042729,11045541,11045168,11042770,11043981,11043339,11046384,11042751,11049211,11042598,11044724,11043688,11044369,11045097,11090097,11044251,11043242,11042546,11044675,11044718,11043143,11042970,11045256,11044081,11046824,11043522,11044770,11046177,11047151,11043728,11046818,11045514,11043411,11043382,11047684,11049958,11043121,11043386,11046622,11042372,11043604,11045972,11044315,11043219,11044352,11043011,11043771,11043178,11046172,11044879,11043513,11043275,11043606,11043592,11043436,11042867,11042612,11043610,11048472,11046836,11043239,11044849,11043279,11045990,11047052,11042719,11042484],"score":1012,"time":1454688436,"title":"LinkedIn shares drop 40%, erasing $10B of company's value","type":"story","url":"http://www.businessinsider.com/linkedin-earnings-q4-2016-2"},{"by":"nns","descendants":52,"id":11042259,"kids":[11042929,11043578,11042712,11042972,11043468],"score":44,"time":1454688271,"title":"Julian Assange decision by UN panel ridiculous, says Hammond","type":"story","url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35504237"},{"by":"Thevet","descendants":11,"id":11042247,"kids":[11060583,11061747,11060696,11061925,11061066],"score":43,"time":1454688191,"title":"150 Years of Immigration in America, Visualized","type":"story","url":"http://www.fastcodesign.com/3056173/infographic-of-the-day/150-years-of-immigration-in-america-visualized"},{"by":"ungzd","descendants":2,"id":11042157,"kids":[11042385,11042425],"score":18,"time":1454687428,"title":"You are an advanced AI that controls a smart house.

When I first arrived on the scene, I saw that there was absolutely no organization in the 3D models, textures, scripts, etc. It actually took a full 2 weeks to figure out what pieces were being used in the current working build. Now I am able to navigate and do my work no problem. However, we just added two new members to the team and they spent an hour talking about how disappointed they were that they were expected to just know what to do after having been given that jumbled mess. I&#x27;ve been looking around online for examples of folder organization and naming conventions for the variety of files used in a game, but with no avail. I was playing Skyrim the other day and all I could think about was how they named all the NPC&#x27;s locally, where they saved all their textures, animations, ai scripts, etc. Even for all their environment assets. Not all rocks are the same, so I am pretty sure they didn&#x27;t name it &quot;rock01&quot; &quot;rock02&quot; etc. Surely there&#x27;s a code or a method for naming everything as well as a folder hierarchy.

It has practical-to-use, interoperable implementations of a wide variety of programming languages: from statically typed OO and OO&#x2F;FP languages (Java, Kotlin, Ceylon, Scala, OCaml-Java) to Lisps (Clojure, ABCL, Kawa) to GIL-less ports of popular scripting languages (JRuby, Jython). You can call Java from a slower language like JRuby for the performance-critical bits instead of having to either write an interpreter extension in C or bite the microservice bullet. Deployment is simple. There is a lot of high-quality open source libraries. The price for this, slower application startup, greater memory usage and, in JRuby&#x27;s case, a degree of incompatibility with the reference implementation, seems worth paying.<p>Still, I don&#x27;t see a great number of startups or side projects that get featured on HN using the JVM from the get-go.

I agreed to by paid far less than normal.<p>I wore a number of hats as you do in startup land, especially in the early days. I was a Project Manager, Tech Lead, Designer &amp; Developer. Not to be arrogant here, but somebody with this skill set was absolutely crucial to get us to where we are today. Solid deliverables were delivered and the founders were always so pleased and excited to have me on the team.<p>Before I came on board, they were trying to outsource their technology to india. Sending bad looking designs and technical specs written by a non-techy. The final result was always so average. A company specialising in delivering tech, couldn&#x27;t deliver tech.<p>When I started, we continued with the outsourcing for sometime but with my oversight and redesign of the platforms.. After some time, it simply was not working. I had the connections to bring on a new developer so we could start building things in-house, with proper development cycles, oversight &amp; accountability. So we did that. Over the course of the year the team grew. We&#x27;re now at 6.<p>Once this happened, we started landing some pretty cool projects thanks to the teams work. The capability and the quality of work we were putting forward and the character of us all helped significantly with getting these projects on board.\nA year has passed and I have poured my heart and soul in to the company. I&#x27;m pulling 70-80 hour weeks every few weeks- working till all hours of the morning getting things done. Not to forget I&#x27;m not on a cushy funded start-up salary (far from it).\nHN, what would you value somebody like myself on your team?

I tell myself that I can&#x27;t get a job as a counselor since I don&#x27;t have a Masters degree.

Most representations of them I&#x27;ve found online have a big tree structure that takes up lots of space, but I realized I could use them in an indented bulleted list since that&#x27;s also a tree structure. For example:<p>Plaintext argument maps are superior to just bullet points<p><pre><code>  - Support: prefixing each bullet&#x27;s content with &quot;support&quot; or &quot;oppose&quot;\n    lets you easily see the logical relationships between concepts\n  - Support: since this just uses plaintext, it works anywhere you can\n    type\n  - Support: if you have to use &quot;support&quot; or &quot;oppose&quot; for each bulleted\n    item, then you naturally don&#x27;t bother listing things that aren&#x27;t\n    relevant, because they won&#x27;t support or oppose\n    - Support: and if you&#x27;re sure that something&#x27;s relevant, but it both\n      supports and opposes, then clearly you need to either start with a\n      more fundamental assertion or break down the mixed support&#x2F;oppose\n      item into separate concepts\n  - Oppose: writing &quot;support&quot; and &quot;oppose&quot; for everything requires more\n    writing\n    - Oppose: you can abbreviate them as &quot;S&quot; and &quot;O&quot; if you&#x27;re not\n      illustrating the concept\n      - Support: This is kind of hard to read... single capital letters\n        at the start of lines stand out more from the prose\n  - Oppose: if I want to share my notes with people and I use this goofy\n    notation, I&#x27;ll have to explain it to them and I&#x27;ll feel like a huge\n    dork\n    - Support: this is accurate, it&#x27;s pretty embarrassing\n</code></pre>\nAnyway, I figured I&#x27;d share it if it might be useful to anyone else.

I want to meet programmers like me but can&#x27;t seem to find any user groups or meet ups that aren&#x27;t in SF (I don&#x27;t have a car), and I can&#x27;t get a full time job so I&#x27;m trying to find internships and am trying my best but it feels like you need to know people to get in the door.
