This is simplified but I was hoping someone here could shed some more light on what the <i>actual value</i> of these coins are.<p>- The coins are bought with dollars (or other gov&#x27;t backed currencies, for the sake of argument I will just use USD).<p>- USD yes are fiat, but at the end of the day they represent time, labor, &amp; goods. This system came into place because back in the day it was very hard to bargain with non-comparable goods. For instance if a coffee farmer needs more cows, the only thing they could do before fiat currency is find a cow farmer who also needs coffee and make a trade. With fiat currency they can sell for dollars (which represent their goods).<p>- I buy 10$USD worth of bitcoin when bitcoin&#x27;s price is 1$&#x2F;coin. So I have 10 bitcoins. Then bitcoin&#x27;s price goes up to 100$&#x2F;coin and I now have $1000USD in bitcoin.<p>My real question is - where is this value coming from? Why is the price of the coin going up while the price of dollars is relatively stable? When investing in traditional securities - investors tie the stock price to the actual value of the company in hopes of dividends, or selling at a higher price later because the company&#x27;s value grew (having more cash, assets, etc).<p>So right now crypto&#x27;s price is high.

I made this GitHub repo to try and show WebRTC data channels and the connection establishment flow in a different way from what I was able to find online.<p>My aim with this repository is to make WebRTC data channels accessible to any web developer by showcasing offerer and answerer separately for total novices (makes it much clearer what&#x27;s going on on each end of the connection) as well as combined approach where a peer can be both offerer and answerer.<p>I use postMessage instead of a real signalling channel, because I got fed up with people bringing whatever 3rd party signalling solutions to their WebRTC tutorials and I want for this to be as simple to set up and run as possible. That&#x27;s why it returns off file protocol - no server needed, just open and play!<p>One more goal with this tutorial is to keep it up to date. Once a supported browser (Chrome, Firefox) starts complaining about a deprecated API or the WebRTC spec evolves, I try to rewrite the demo to use the latest and greatest. You can see that in me using async&#x2F;await instead of promises which also tremendously helps readability.<p>In the future, I will extend this to support mesh connection topology and make it possible to hold group conversations or multiple conversations at the same time.<p>If you&#x27;ve been waiting to see what all the fuss with WebRTC is about, I hope this encourages you to start exploring.

In time surely I also developed and improved the framework. Currently, I released the v7.<p>If I need to give some info. about versions. I first made the v5 open-source that was the version came from 2004. It was the worst written code. I always had fears that I&#x27;ll lose control of my codes if I make them open-source. Yea, I know, total ignorance. That&#x27;s why I made the worst version open-source but in years, lots of things changed in my mind. I released the v6 version that came from 2008 which had better structure and more readable code. All codes where written in VB.NET. Why? no reason. But I know that developers are more willing to work on C# if it will be a .NET language.<p>That&#x27;s why I rewrote v7 (VB.NET) version that came from 2010 in C# in last 5 months with the true support of .NET Standard to make the framework completely OS Independent and also I believed I&#x27;ll find users and contributors easier if make it in C#. There is still some lack of features that are already on v7 (VB.NET) version but not in v7 (C#) version. But they will finish soon.<p>So, what I want is to announce this framework on somewhere to take attention of developers. It is a really good framework. I&#x27;m not telling that because I developed it. I&#x27;m telling that because I believe, it will bring something new to the programming world about development, deployment, and the like.

HN!<p>We are launching an app (Mirror) that uses a single selfie to create ~250 emoji&#x2F;stickers that look like you and your friends.<p>We previously started a large online travel company in Russia (Ostrovok, &gt;$500m in sales this year) and while there got very interested in AI as a tool to solve business objectives like predicting cancelations or conversion rates to inform marketing spend. And when we started something new, we wanted a product that had extremely high-frequency usage to build feedback loops into + something that a lot of humans really want to do, but that AI can do better.<p>Emoji keyboards sound like trivial toys, but this is actually a path to teaching AI one of the most complex human social behaviors. Offline, our faces communicate the majority of information that passes between us; far more than words do. In fact there is a whole piece of our brain (fusiform gyrus) dedicated to facial analysis and if lesioned humans lose ability to read faces while losing nothing else. Basically humans pay closer attention to faces than to any other object in the universe – from the day we are born.<p>AI needs data that informs it whether its decisions are right. And emoji are by far the largest structured source of facial data + usage in the world – &gt;15 billion sent a day. Getting that ocean of data will help train AI that can solve all kinds of future problems – from VR characters that look like you in the gameworld, to personalized advertising that has your face in it the way you like, and a lot of other things. Everyone asks us why after starting a big “serious&quot; company, we decided to work with emoji, and this is the reason.<p>On to the actual product. We think custom emoji apps like Bitmoji are a good step towards bringing our real, unique faces into messaging. We take this further and let you:<p>- Get your emoji in 3 seconds with one tap.<p>- Not spend mental energy wondering what your head shape&#x2F;nose shape etc. are<p>- Add your friends&#x2F;family (soon your pets and more) to your own emoji in seconds. Manually constructing 10+ friends is just too hard.<p>- Use all text-containing emoji in 8 languages (will expand to &gt;25 shortly). We really have no idea why Bitmoji and other such apps tend to be English-only.<p>- Get emoji that become more and more recognizable&#x2F;liked with time by learning from data (explicit choices + implicit metrics). For example we see that people want larger-than proportional eyes and darker skin. Except in Japan where it seems users want lighter skin. Really excited to find more like this with usage data.<p>Google Allo (and some others) tried doing this but got very little done. The reason is that while the idea is extremely obvious, the tech is quite hard. Here&#x27;s why:<p>- You have to get a lot of facial features right. Some of these (e.g. hair, facial hair) are very diverse across age&#x2F;sex&#x2F;ethnicity. Some (e.g. head shape) are 3d but need to be inferred from shadows in a 2d image. Some (e.g. lower eyelids or wrinkles) can be detected but have a tradeoff of authenticity vs beauty. Some (colors of skin, hair, lips, eyes, eyebrows) are highly dependent on lighting conditions. All are must-haves. And this is still not enough – you have to detect and place wrinkles, birthmarks, sunspots etc. too<p>- You have to compensate for a lot of variability in selfie-taking – lighting&#x2F;shadows, turn&#x2F;pitch&#x2F;tilt, camera distance, device camera type, background, whether the user is smiling or not etc.<p>- You have to use one photo to infer and reconstruct how that person looks with different emotions.<p>- There’s a whole dedicated part of the brain for this task, with a lot of neural machinery (fusiform gyrus). Humans can’t formally explain how they recognize other humans, but are very demanding to result quality. Humans take our exceptional skill at face recognition for granted, although for us a face is THE most well-perceived object in the universe. Think about it: can you instantly recognize a piece of a random wall that looks similar to every other wall, and that you stared at for an hour 10 years ago? You can do this with a face.<p>All the above makes training neural nets that solve recreating (rather than simply recognizing) faces much harder.<p>It took us close to a year and a large engineering team + multiple people with many years of experience with faces to get this to beta.<p>We know there is still a long way to go to make the product great. Right now we are working on several things to make it better:<p>- improving the tech from just “personalized” to “recognizable by friends” – both by utilizing feedback loops and by looking at new developments in AI. Particularly excited about GANs although we don&#x27;t see a pure-GAN approach as viable (longer discussion).<p>- adding new features – e.g. auto-detection of groups of people, pets, clothes, backgrounds. doing a lot of this automatically based on your Photo Stream content and on-device ML technologies.<p>- expanding our content library to ~10,000 emoji in 25 languages.<p>You can get the app here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mirror-ai.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mirror-ai.com&#x2F;</a><p>Let us know what you think – we really appreciate all your advice!","time":1513187750,"title":"Launch HN: Mirror (YC W17) – turn a selfie into emoji that look like you","type":"story"},{"by":"svdree","dead":true,"id":15915929,"kids":[15916385,15916349,15916413,15916376],"score":17,"time":1513187640,"title":"A.I.-based Cryptocurrency trading signals","type":"story","url":"https://coinloop.io"},{"by":"smacktoward","descendants":37,"id":15915775,"kids":[15916169,15916538,15916110,15916102,15916359,15920950,15916078],"score":174,"time":1513186632,"title":"Harvey Weinstein Is My Monster Too","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/13/opinion/contributors/salma-hayek-harvey-weinstein.html?_r=0"},{"by":"bcaulfield","descendants":7,"id":15915734,"kids":[15917331,15916871,15917615,15916797,15916194,15916116,15916147],"score":21,"time":1513186321,"title":"Weaponised microwave may be behind alleged sonic attacks in Cuba","type":"story","url":"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2156164-weaponised-microwave-may-be-behind-alleged-sonic-attacks-in-cuba/"},{"by":"hardtke","descendants":13,"id":15915709,"kids":[15920805,15928034,15922854],"score":123,"time":1513186125,"title":"Electromagnetic Water Cloak Eliminates Drag and Wake","type":"story","url":"https://pratt.duke.edu/news/water-cloak"},{"by":"binaryapparatus","descendants":3,"id":15915701,"kids":[15915863,15916735,15917215],"score":12,"time":1513186035,"title":"2017 iMac Pro Scores Worse Than 2010 Mac Pro in Geekbench OpenCL","type":"story","url":"https://mobile.twitter.com/barefeats/status/940805162008023040"},{"by":"defen","descendants":6,"id":15915658,"kids":[15916038,15915893],"score":1,"text":"Surveying the async networking landscape for Python has me a bit overwhelmed.

We’ve raised about $500k of convertible debt, mostly in chunks of $25-50k from angels (a process that can only be described as excruciating). We’ve both been C-level execs at startups with &gt; $30M in revenue and successful exits, but we’ve had a difficult time raising institutional money - partly because of where we’re located, and partly because we’ve done a poor job of telling our story.<p>We’re set up for consumer-facing ACH, with a nice KYC process (custom Yodlee integration, mobile photo id upload). We have a very favorable banking contract - an FBO account with great pricing, generous limits, a direct-to-Fed ACH provider, and terms that <i>may</i> allow ACH cryptocurrency conversion. We also have the ability to pay out to about 30 countries in South America, Africa, and Asia. The flow of funds is completely automated including reversals. It’s a modern code base : Golang&#x2F;Redis&#x2F;Postgres on AWS (~120k LOC).<p>We’ve just launched the product in beta, and have about a dozen SMB customers but we’re completely broke. Our product is somewhat differentiated (other unique features, not relevant here), but given the increasingly crowded payments landscape, we feel we’d need a 7-figure raise to make a go of it, and that doesn’t seem likely in the short term.<p>With that in mind, we’d like to see if we can find a home for the codebase.

He was saying that in five years, technology will advance to the point where frontend engineers (whether mobile or web) will no longer be needed, and that the designer will be able to take charge of the entire user experience directly, rather than indirectly through engineers.<p>I told him there&#x27;s a lot happening that he doesn&#x27;t understand, but upon reflection, the majority of work a frontend engineer does is routine and mundane rather than creative: wiring UI elements together, creating them, initialising them, add event listeners, fetching data from a server, saving it back, and so on. I have worked on a half-dozen frontend platforms (iOS, Android, J2ME, Symbian, Windows Mobile, web, Flash) and still, when I do a project, I end up doing tons of plumbing that I didn&#x27;t anticipate until I got into the details. This plumbing doesn&#x27;t add business value.<p>What are some technologies that are being developed today that are not ready for production use, but will be in five years, that aim to eliminate frontend engineers? Or, make do with fewer frontend engineers? What are some higher levels of abstraction being built?<p>Here&#x27;s an analogy: in college, I had to write a paper using LaTeX. I found it a frustrating exercise, with unnatural syntax and terminology I had to learn, and I&#x27;d always get compile errors.

I am wondering about the factors that impact the timing of when to establish an LLC.<p>I have also heard about individuals establishing S-corps, but is that overkill for an early stage startup or a valid pre-emptive step?<p>Based on taking a look at the differences between LLCs and S-corps[0] it seems LLCs are much less of a headache for comparable benefit for very small startups, but again I am a novice in understanding business taxes.<p>I have also read about people creating Delaware or Nevada LLCs, but I am not sure what triggers that decision when the primary place of business is not in those states (unless it doesn&#x27;t matter for websites with no physical place?)?<p>These kinds of scenarios are new to me, so any guidance or personal experiences are greatly appreciated, thanks!<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;personal-finance&#x2F;011216&#x2F;s-corp-vs-llc-which-should-i-choose.asp","time":1513114562,"title":"Ask HN: When to establish an LLC or S-corp for a 1-person startup?","type":"story"},{"by":"doener","descendants":2,"id":15909754,"kids":[15911270,15910163],"score":24,"time":1513114681,"title":"Europe to hand out free Interrail train tickets to 18-year-olds","type":"story","url":"https://www.lonelyplanet.com/news/2017/12/11/europe-free-interrail-tickets-18-year-olds/"},{"by":"stablemap","descendants":24,"id":15909710,"kids":[15912066,15916339,15910477,15910863,15910861,15911654,15910022,15910148,15912006,15913909],"score":240,"time":1513114404,"title":"NIPS 2017 Notes [pdf]","type":"story","url":"https://cs.brown.edu/~dabel/blog/posts/misc/nips_2017.pdf"},{"by":"eiskalt","descendants":28,"id":15909604,"kids":[15910649,15910262,15913321,15912914,15913285,15913046,15911559,15912487,15910012,15910173],"score":94,"time":1513113784,"title":"Show HN: Build your Linux from Scratch inside Docker with one command","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/reinterpretcat/lfs"},{"by":"kevlened","descendants":5,"id":15909573,"kids":[15911096,15911107],"score":35,"time":1513113569,"title":"Quantum Computing for Morons","type":"story","url":"http://thinkingofutils.com/2017/12/quantum-computers/"},{"by":"ergenekonyigit","descendants":125,"id":15909514,"kids":[15909818,15909717,15910470,15910005,15912784,15912875,15910673,15910149,15910027,15909985,15910317,15909765,15909683,15909808,15909932,15911323,15910129,15910283,15909685,15910704,15914985,15914782,15909676,15910158],"score":173,"time":1513113110,"title":"DIY MacBook Stand","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/ergenekonyigit/diy-macbook-stand"},{"by":"ingve","descendants":11,"id":15909455,"kids":[15910420,15910761,15911066],"score":48,"time":1513112676,"title":"Intel 64 and IA32 Architectures Performance Monitoring Events [pdf]","type":"story","url":"https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/8b/6e/335279_performance_monitoring_events_guide.pdf"},{"by":"lainon","descendants":56,"id":15909431,"kids":[15910523,15909896,15910904,15909971,15909679,15910448,15909723],"score":147,"time":1513112532,"title":"New silicon structure opens the gate to quantum computers","type":"story","url":"https://www.princeton.edu/news/2017/12/11/new-silicon-structure-opens-gate-quantum-computers"},{"by":"annekate","descendants":147,"id":15909395,"kids":[15909776,15910261,15910091,15910204,15911199,15909521,15909863,15915476,15911075,15910501,15909981,15912574,15910017,15912594,15910112,15913459,15909894,15910957,15910490,15911555,15913607,15913070,15911963,15914535,15912491,15911709,15911861,15911722,15911694,15912986,15912719],"score":693,"time":1513112278,"title":"How to get your first 100k active users","type":"story","url":"https://blog.winnie.com/how-to-get-your-first-100k-active-users-909fa4292a27"},{"by":"khalidlafi","descendants":3,"id":15909348,"kids":[15909397,15909480],"score":6,"time":1513112020,"title":"Show HN: RedFI – Redis Fault-Injection Proxy","type":"story","url":"https://openfip.github.io/redfi"},{"by":"imartin2k","descendants":33,"id":15909319,"kids":[15910168,15911412,15913556,15912877,15912081,15910031,15932923,15912246,15913554,15913361,15914129,15915599,15912218,15909800],"score":140,"time":1513111777,"title":"Step-By-Step Fundraising Tactics from an NYC Founder Who Raised $750M","type":"story","url":"http://firstround.com/review/step-by-step-fundraising-tactics-from-the-nyc-legend-who-raised-750m/"},{"by":"phoe17","descendants":73,"id":15909246,"kids":[15909548,15909715,15909545,15909878,15909309,15909532,15909858,15909578,15910277,15913869,15909611,15909293,15909374,15911244,15909772,15909669,15909591,15909505,15910744,15916334,15909526,15909664,15910410],"score":63,"text":"I have been following the rise of value but I am still unsure about reason behind its rise.<p>Most of the discussions point on crypto sub-reddits are about buying and HODL-ing.

I know the usual drill - &quot;it will pass&quot;, &quot;time heals&quot;, &quot;there are plenty of fish&quot; etc. but it&#x27;s not helping here and not even the point - she has been through many broken relationships before. She&#x27;s also really beautiful and has plenty of guys that would do anything for her, so it&#x27;s not the lack of attention or opportunities. The point is, that she&#x27;s <i>extremely self-destructive</i>. She has driven away <i>all</i> the people that has once cared about her, including the closest relatives - mother, father, brother, and all the friends. Those, who at least still talk to her, keep their distance. The problem is, that it looks like she <i>doesn&#x27;t want to be helped</i>. I&#x27;m the only one left.<p>She goes to therapy, drinks antidepressants, but it doesn&#x27;t seem that it&#x27;s helping in any way. I&#x27;m now worried, that she might really commit suicide, as few days ago I noticed she started cutting herself again (hasn&#x27;t done that for &gt;5 years) and during the recent feud with my girlfriend (who also genuinely tried to help her until this) invited to her own funeral in <i>two weeks</i>.

Many of them don&#x27;t have enough work to hire a full-time technical writer, but they still need docs.

I always preferred Craigslist because there are no fees and it feels more authentic, but Airbnb is more convenient when you need something quick and want to avoid scammers. However, after a while I got so upset with the fees on Airbnb and the fact that they make you work around their censorship (emails, phone numbers etc. are redacted).

excited about. Two years later and multiple management re-orgs and code rewrites behind, I&#x27;m finding myself in a difficult spot. My job has turned into a big source of stress and unhappiness. The team is highly disorganized, understaffed, and in a constant state of chaos. It seems like we&#x27;re always moving from one crisis to the next. In addition to that, with the constant rewrites, the product hasn&#x27;t progressed much. I&#x27;m not growing my technical skills like I should be. I&#x27;ve talked to my manager about this repeatedly, and he agrees things need to improve, but nothing changes.<p>Six weeks ago, I decided the situation wouldn&#x27;t get better and I needed to move to a different team. I figured I&#x27;d start interviewing, but that hasn&#x27;t worked out so well. For one, I feel like my resume is a little weak because the past two years haven&#x27;t added much to my skillset. I thought I could make up for that by doing really well in the coding interviews or doing side projects. The thing is, there&#x27;s been extra chaos at work recently. I come home physically and mentally drained. I&#x27;m finding it very difficult to muster the energy to do more programming at night.<p>I&#x27;d like to get out of this situation as soon as possible, but finding a good next position might take me a couple of months in this environment. My question is: is there anything I can do in the short term to get out of this toxic environment while I find my next job?<p>I could take off a couple of months and live off of savings while I work on side projects and prepare for interviews, but I&#x27;m afraid a gap in my resume will be red flag for recruiters.

It&#x27;s weird.<p>Haskell - good, but it feels like you&#x27;re learning the standard library, not the language<p>Smalltalk - truly minimalistic, but it feels like BASIC and is a little slow<p>Elixir - once again, good, but focused for web servers and telecommunications (it&#x27;s not specialized, just the community).<p>Go - seems like an insult created by google to the intelligence of

A team of 5 has worked on the company for a few months with zero or reduced salary. We are a platform to digitally handle real estate titles (to start!) leveraging the blockchain, offering an API for companies so that they can provide their services to homeowners. Think of it as, in principle, a Twilio for real estate. Our solution is fully legacy-friendly, and doesn&#x27;t require any change of law, or any agreement with a county. Yes, we&#x27;re focusing on the US market initially.<p>We are now raising a seed round of $1M, at a $12M cap. We believe the $1M is enough to build the product. We also believe that the $12M cap rightfully represents the amount of work and money already put in the company, and the de-risking made possible by these months of work.\nThe team is quite senior, with exec-level roles at Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Vodafone, etc.<p>Some seed investors have objected that we should reduce our cap to something like $6M, and possibly raise a slightly larger amount ($1.5M or so). Other than that, they like the team and the value prop quite a lot.<p>Do you think their objection on the cap makes sense? What kind of reasoning can be done when evaluating these two numbers (amount raised, and cap), in this particular situation?<p>For full context: I have invested in more than 60 startups in the past few years with a small seed fund (never lead investors), plus another 6 as an angel.

They may be happy, but I can&#x27;t imagine to do this. I also don&#x27;t want to be a consultant working 80-hour-weeks doing legacy SAP maintenance or building yet another website to manage some documents.<p>I&#x27;m always seeking for opportunities to build a start-up.

That would suit my style bc I despise routine. I can imagine to optimize workflows (digitalization) where I just analyze the processes, make them faster and go to the next project. I&#x27;m currently doing this for a company and it&#x27;s exciting to see the direct effect of my work. - I&#x27;ve built several bots (e.g. solving reCAPTCHAs, simulating user interactions, nothing sketchy), but I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a direction I want to really dive in (it&#x27;s pretty simple).<p>I&#x27;m also interested in ML and currently learning it, but without good ideas for applications it&#x27;s just another thing in the tool belt.

In an era where foreign governments have indisputably tried to use the internet and social media to influence our elections, federal &amp; state governments should be working together to ensure that malevolent actors cannot subvert our administrative agencies’ decision-making processes. You can watch our full press conference here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;TtZEC21QN-c\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;TtZEC21QN-c</a>.<p>I’ll be back this afternoon to take your questions!<p>In the meantime, a few things you can do to help in this fight:<p>1. My office requested help in our investigation from the FCC at least 9 times, but the FCC’s Chairman and his staff responded by stonewalling (yesterday, the FCC’s IG finally indicated they may assist with our investigation). So we’ve gone to the public. My office has set up a website for you to check whether your name was used to submit fake comments, &amp; file a report if it was: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ag.ny.gov&#x2F;fakecomments\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ag.ny.gov&#x2F;fakecomments</a>.<p>2. While FCC Chairman Pai has declared his intention to roll back net neutrality, we can still beat this effort back in Congress. If you haven&#x27;t already spoken to your representatives, please do it today. You can contact your Senators and Congresspeople through the Capitol switchboard at (202) 224-3121.<p>Thanks all. Keep speaking out.","time":1512494704,"title":"AMA: NY AG Schneiderman on net neutrality and protecting our voice in government","type":"story"},{"by":"mudil","descendants":155,"id":15853311,"kids":[15853880,15853612,15853882,15853449,15853931,15853673,15854348,15857440,15853620,15853570,15853947,15853586,15853751,15854019],"score":87,"time":1512494326,"title":"Aetna CEO Set to Reap About $500M If CVS Deal Closes","type":"story","url":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/aetnas-outgoing-ceo-set-to-reap-about-500-million-if-cvs-deal-closes-1512480623"},{"by":"scaryclam","descendants":176,"id":15853290,"kids":[15855478,15854171,15853671,15853813,15854004,15853785,15854063,15853838,15859636,15854127,15853712,15854236,15854202,15854462,15856589,15855490,15860797,15858803,15853390,15854146,15853906,15854654,15859864,15859509,15871201,15854087],"score":231,"time":1512494215,"title":"CryptoKitties craze slows down transactions on Ethereum","type":"story","url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-42237162"},{"by":"aalhour","descendants":46,"id":15853308,"kids":[15854155,15854233,15853587,15854300,15853654,15854644,15854040,15854657,15854844,15854758,15855354,15856911,15854153,15853707,15854608,15854531,15857509,15855041,15854553,15854428,15857416,15856639,15855228,15854052,15855372,15856017,15853504,15853546,15855828,15869833],"score":98,"text":"I picked up Golang recently and I am curious about how people use it to develop web applications.

We thought that it is annoying to invite people for private events. Not all of them have Facebook, not all of them read their emails, not all of them have Whatsapp or Messenger X. So you have to use many different channels to invite everybody and it is hard to get an overview on who is coming. The service I created can be used as a centralized RSVP tool. You create an event and get a unique URL that you can send to people on every channel you like. Then the invitees can open that link and RSVP. Everybody can see all the RSVPs.<p>I use it regularly for recurring events with different groups of friends. And whenever I get an email&#x2F;SMS&#x2F;message&#x2F;letter invitation with a request to RSVP, I suggest to use that service instead for next time. The service has been online for over a year and at least a couple of hundreds of people have seen it.<p>There hasn&#x27;t been a single person to ever use it for more than creating a dummy event.<p>I&#x27;m wondering what&#x27;s wrong with it. The goal was never to become the-next-big-thing, I never submitted it to the usual websites, I never created an ad, I never updated its Facebook page or tweeted about it. So I&#x27;m not complaining that there are hardly any visitors. I&#x27;m just not sure why the conversion rate of creating events and inviting people is 0 and I wonder what you think about it. Is it not solving a real problem? Is it unclear? Does it have a bad UX? Is it a bad execution? Does it have to be a mobile app? Chat bot?

I love coming up with clever solutions to problems, I love refactoring parts of a codebase - reduing the number of lines of code and making things more understandable, I even love the boring bits - fixing bugs etc. However I feel that the practice of SCRUM in my current job is preventing me from doing that. Anytime an interesting problem comes up to solve we reduce it into ridiculously small cards like &quot;research how to connect to this API&quot;, &quot;Evaluate if we can use this library&quot;, &quot;Write a proposal on how to do X&quot; etc.<p>So a problem which would take 1-2 months for a couple developers working together to solve now takes 6 months. Because we break it into unrealistically small steps and as soon as you finish one step you have to wait for the end of the sprint (2 weeks) and present it, then groom&#x2F;plan the next step. Its micromanagement to the extreme. No boss would ever be able to micro manage this much but for an entire team participating in scrum this is what happens.<p>Its impossible for me to sink my teeth into any interesting problems. I feel like the other developers on the team have bought into the scrum mindset and we treat each other like children who need to be told exactly what to do and how to do it, there can be no unknowns. For somebody who gets a thrill out of a challenge the SCRUM mentality is driving me crazy. I have brought up some of these issues and nobody else on the team feels the same way.

Most of your product is written in JavaScript (front-end and back-end). Of course, this is a complete nightmare as we have over 500 active developers on the project. Not to mention the fact that at most 5% of the code is commented or documented in any way whatsoever. This makes maintenance, code-reading, refactoring, and testing almost impossible. Broken hacks are fixed with more broken hacks, and most of our &quot;business data&quot; is passed around as raw JSON objects who&#x27;s structure you can&#x27;t possibly know until you evaluate the objects at runtime. Perhaps the worst part is that very little of this code is tested. In fact, large areas of our project are hovering around 50-60% code coverage, and these are areas that are responsible for handling our customer&#x27;s financial data. The part that irks me the most is that most of our additions and new features are merged without any unit or integration tests whatsoever. Instead, we relegate all our interns to do manual testing on our product on a weekly basis, so when bugs make it into production it&#x27;s their fault for not finding them, never mind that new features are often not even manually tested by the people who developed them.

I don&#x27;t think anyone would pay to use the transpiler as it is a pretty simple concept. I don&#x27;t have any experience writing a book about the topic. I don&#x27;t think open source with donation button would really bring in anything, but open source code is expected by most. And it begs the question though, how mature really is this thing? I can write more readable code now (anecdotal of course) but while it might be ideal to have an end game of eventually a complete readable programming language, that&#x27;s not something I could accomplish alone and my time is limited. Anyways, if there really isn&#x27;t an income opportunity around doing this I&#x27;d like to find out. Is there a way to either make money off this or get more feedback about how valuable this would be?","time":1511883502,"title":"Ask HN: I stumbled upon a new programming paradigm, what should I do next?","type":"story"},{"by":"artsandsci","dead":true,"id":15798128,"kids":[15798438,15798250,15798299],"score":11,"time":1511883352,"title":"Elon Musk Debunks Rumor He Is Bitcoin's Satoshi Nakamoto","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-28/elon-musk-tweets-to-debunk-speculation-that-he-s-behind-bitcoin"},{"by":"Random_Person","descendants":4,"id":15797932,"kids":[15798017,15804998],"score":2,"text":"Short story: I&#x27;m losing my job of 8 years on June 30th.

Not having a job for so long has taken a toll on me. I lost the interest to hang out with people. Since losing my last job a year ago, I couldn&#x27;t really hang out with my friends without bringing up jobs at some point, because that&#x27;s all I can think of right now. Money and the prospect of an average-paying job are on my mind.<p>I didn&#x27;t want to be that guy who only complains to their friends, so I took a sabbatical and &quot;went silent&quot; with my friends with the exception of occasionally PM them online for small talk. Almost none of my friends are programmers nor know many people who hire them, so I stopped bugging them. As for my colleagues, it&#x27;s the same story- I ask them if they know anyone that&#x27;s hiring, they say no but they&#x27;ll &quot;keep an eye out&quot;. They always say something like that.<p>A couple months ago I applied for Medicaid from my state&#x27;s Dept. of Human Services because my savings were getting very low. I eventually got approved, but was left wondering why my taxes to the state could only offer cash, TANF and medical assistance, but why gov&#x27;t sponsored &quot;job matchmaking&quot; for able-bodied people doesn&#x27;t exist. A lot of people would rather just get an appropriate job no-strings-attached than sit around sending job apps and collecting welfare.<p>All I do now is apply for jobs online, randomly browse places like Reddit and hit the occasional tech meetup. Other than that most of my time is taken up doing errands for my mom.<p>These meetups, well they are good time killers, but not making any headway there either. I get business cards, email people and get placed into a few interviews but not getting offers.<p>I wonder what place is there for shut-ins like me in this world to be a productive member of society again without the barrier of the hiring process.

The ssl certificate is shared between several site, but oh well, it&#x27;ll do.<p>I reused an old domain (vv.mk), that I had previously used for a Blogger blog, spent some time playing with latencies, as my page loaded in a second and a half, and Cloudflare didn&#x27;t seem to cache it. Lesson: Cloudflare does not edge-cache html, and you need a Page Rule to enable it via their interface.<p>I learnt a bit about webfonts, and finally decided to host the fonts myself (on Github pages), rather than do a roundtrip to google, as it added about 300ms on average to page load, using a setup that would work for most recent browsers (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com).<p>I confirmed I had a blazingly fast site via http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.webpagetest.org&#x2F; and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.keycdn.com&#x2F;, and then it was time to make Google return it when people searched for my full name.<p>To my chagrin, this does not seem to be easy. I added my name to the title and the description HTML meta tags. I added the domain to the Google Search Console in all its versions (www, no-www, http, https), asked the Google crawler to cralw it and update its index. I added links to it to my social networks profiles where they hadn&#x27;t been already added.<p>A day after, the Google index is not updated, my site, along with the description of the content that it had up to a day ago, is buried well into the 4th Google results page. My google searches on SEO of personal websites have been completely unfruitful. The 1st Google results page is still populated with useful info (most of my social network profiles), but it seems logical that a personal website would be returned as the first result.<p>Any tips?<p>edit: Most of the comments suggest this is due to the lack of content.

I can&#x27;t help but love Scala and the ecosystem, I want to explore it further, dig deeper down the FP rabbit-hole, work with actors in the real-world.<p>I&#x27;m now determined to work with Scala when I graduate.

The new gig is an eye opener. I get a LOT of code review comments. While some were about styling and conventions and I no longer make those mistakes, others are more about design&#x2F;bugs. I&#x27;m glad that I have someone who reviews them and gives me constructive feedback. What concerns me is that I repeat some mistakes and I often get the feeling that I&#x27;m not careful&#x2F;diligent enough and let things slip through - this is after my &#x27;careful&#x27; self review of my pull request.\nSome of the issues I struggle with:<p>1. Missed use cases. Goal was to do X when Y is the input. But I forgot that Z also could be an input.<p>2. Passing around entire objects between methods instead of just their id in the db<p>3. Not using existing util function. I either forget that there&#x27;s a util function for this, or I&#x27;m not aware that there&#x27;s a util function for this.<p>4. General lousiness. Missing to mention all params in the docstring, and similar stuff<p>5. Desire to be regarded as fast. I see an existing method that could be refactored - I skip refactoring it because my priority is to ship my feature <i>right now</i>. In another instance, I copied a few existing methods to my new class because moving them to an abstract class and then re-using them would have been too much work, since I might have to fix the tests as well. There&#x27;s no pressure on me to work faster from any stakeholder<p>6. A general tendency to minimize work. Refactor existing methods even though I&#x27;m not touching them? Work. Read up on how our deployment works even though I don&#x27;t really have to know it? Not today maybe tomorrow. I love being a programmer so a lack of interest or an &#x27;I don&#x27;t care&#x27; attitude is not likely to be the problem here.<p>Have you gone through similar experiences?

I&#x27;ve recently found this &#x27;high functioning alcoholism&#x27; term and realized this is me. Which scares me a lot. I do know people that drink a lot in my family (I&#x27;m from eastern Europe...) and until recently I&#x27;ve never considered myself similar to them. \nFor the record, I&#x27;m drinking on average 5 evenings per week, between half and a full bottle of wine (which is not that much, certainly I got used to it, so it doesn&#x27;t put me in the drunk mode neither).<p>I keep an &#x27;inner scorecard&#x27; which means I evaluate myself against what I used to be, and what I think I can accomplish (did I perform &#x2F; accomplish something up to my potential, or did I just did a half-ass effort). Funnily enough, I always somehow discarded alcohol as a factor, justifying it (to myself) that it&#x27;s not that influencing. Which is of course false. I should add that I work in the evenings very often (I love what I do btw) and most of those time, I drink too when working.<p>What made me realize this problem much more efficiently was running. I started quite recently and did some tests - how I perform, with the same training scheme, with and without alcohol for a period of time. Numbers don&#x27;t lie. I run much better and also feel better.<p>As to why I&#x27;m drinking when I&#x27;m working alone, I don&#x27;t really know (other than I like the taste). Not necessarily to forget problems or something. With perspective, this amounts to huge chunks of time, which certainly impacts my work on side projects &#x2F; business. Sometimes I think I drink because I&#x27;m scared to actually succeed with this side stuff, and somehow unconsciously I sabotage myself.<p>Are &#x2F; were you in this situation ?

guys, every month, our small team lost hundreds of hours testing our app on various iOS and various devices. Sometimes our app will break on iPhone 7&#x27;s iOS 10 but works fine on iPhone 7+&#x27;s iOS 11. A recent Safari bug made our app unusable on Yosemite and El Capitan, but works fine on Sierra - and we have to spend a ton of energy stressfully updating, pulling, rejecting, explaining to angry users, and fixing reviews.<p>We start to feel that the iOS&#x2F;macOS eco-system and device landscape is so fragmented right now for both native and hybrids apps we&#x27;re developing. Take another example, we&#x27;ve seen iPhone 8+&#x27;s Safari and native table view behaves very different from iPhone 7+ of the same iOS version due to timeout and performance different in the phones. It&#x27;s even more frustrating consider these devices have different VRAMs.<p>It&#x27;s mind boggling that now these days some same swift code would work differently in ios10 and ios11, and iOS development feels a lot more similar to or worse than Android development now.<p>We&#x27;re thinking to just buy a few Macs and iPhones to make our lives easier.

(here you can listen to it: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;soundcloud.com&#x2F;join-leave&#x2F;run-away-feat-dyllan and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;soundcloud.com&#x2F;join-leave&#x2F;nouvelle-collection-ocean-souvenir) , but I&#x27;ve noticed it seems to happen to other people too.<p>More specifically:<p>* You can often see new content submitted by a random guy with 100+ or even 1000+ votes here on HN. This is cool!<p>* But I&#x27;ve never seen a community on the web where a random musician can put his song, and have 100+ and 1000+ likes (except maybe on Youtube, but then you need to have a cool nice video, and this is not always possible for bedroom producers).<p>Networks to share original music are either very small communities (so small audience) or large audience, but very restricted posting rules (&quot;don&#x27;t post your own content&quot;).<p>What is the reason?<p>Soundcloud <i>could</i> seem like an answer but it&#x27;s not: if you post on it, nobody sees the song until you share it on another network. Soundcloud doesn&#x27;t feature a Reddit&#x2F;HN list-based &quot;Post your song here&quot; where people can upvote or downvote, in which you can discover new songs.<p>____<p>TL;DR: Bedroom programmers have a large audience on internet for their projects thanks to HN or Reddit. But it seems bedroom music producers don&#x27;t have a similar community. Why? Is there a reason why nobody cares about music posted by random people?","time":1511390144,"title":"Ask HN: Is there no real “Show your music” website worldwide, similar to ShowHN?","type":"story"},{"by":"ryanashcraft","descendants":45,"id":15761026,"kids":[15762899,15763184,15761257,15764374,15765003,15768319,15764147,15764657,15764902],"score":218,"time":1511387572,"title":"How a single PostgreSQL config change improved slow query performance by 50x","type":"story","url":"https://amplitude.engineering/how-a-single-postgresql-config-change-improved-slow-query-performance-by-50x-85593b8991b0"},{"by":"socalnate1","descendants":158,"id":15760981,"kids":[15761384,15761330,15761715,15761355,15761446,15761471,15762441,15761454,15762289,15761436,15761594],"score":139,"time":1511387198,"title":"Britain has abandoned its claim to be the world's fifth largest economy","type":"story","url":"http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/22/news/economy/uk-france-biggest-economies-in-the-world/index.html"},{"by":"sr_banksy","descendants":16,"id":15760481,"kids":[15761012,15762101,15761087,15761303,15760969,15760591,15761617,15761085,15761066,15761052],"score":14,"time":1511383687,"title":"'I Don't Believe in Science', Flat-Earther Set to Launch Himself in Own Rocket","type":"story","url":"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/11/22/565926690/i-dont-believe-in-science-says-flat-earther-set-to-launch-himself-in-own-rocket"},{"by":"acconrad","descendants":12,"id":15760462,"kids":[15761354,15776452,15763198],"score":18,"text":"I&#x27;ve read that in order to attract inbound business, it helps to develop a niche where you can become an expert on something. Two examples include:<p>* Technical experts: People like Jon Skeet (C# StackOverflow guru) and Jacob Thornton (Bootstrap creator)<p>* Tangential experts: People like Patrick MacKenzie (blogged about his software small businesses) and Brennan Dunn (Double your freelancing, aimed largely at software professionals)<p>If I went technical, I&#x27;d probably choose the framework&#x2F;language I use the most in my freelancing work and become a deep expert in that. The upside is it would achieve the goal of more inbound business. The downside is it would be a chore for me to be blogging about topics that haven&#x27;t already been covered - language&#x2F;framework niches are difficult to break into if you aren&#x27;t the creator or early prominent member.<p>If I went tangential, I&#x27;d choose the topic of health and software development. There&#x27;s clearly a market for this (see &quot;The Healthy Programmer&quot;[1]) and I think it&#x27;s a niche I could dominate. I also  would have no trouble creating blog posts, podcasts, and other material to develop this niche.

I&#x27;ve been focusing on web development for almost ten years. I&#x27;ve built up a freelance business with active clients and also tried to work as a Front-end developer for a year in small digital agency.<p>After years I am not satisfied with web development and it doesn&#x27;t make me happy. I can see really young, inexperienced people going into this business, things are changing really fast and there&#x27;s no methodology, no &quot;scientific&quot; way to do it. I can say that web development is somehow punk business with many &quot;script kids&quot; involved.<p>The second thing I don&#x27;t like about the job is lack of social contact. You spend big amount of time in front of a computer and when you want to be the best you have to spend even your free time alone. When you look at those best developers, they look kind of awkward, they don&#x27;t have communication skills and I feel like this is not the way I want to go.<p>Also the third thing that bothers me is the fact that developers are becoming new blue-collar workes (see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;02&#x2F;programming-is-the-new-blue-collar-job&#x2F;) since it&#x27;s kind of easy to learn how to code. You also don&#x27;t need any certification or license. I see that many IT students do have this blue-collar mentality. They dress badly, they swear alot, simply they look like people from lower social classes. This is what bothers me. When I was younger I really appriciated this &quot;punk&quot; side of the IT. Now I hate it.<p>What I am thinkin about is career change to medicine. I am interested in human body and would enjoy studying it. Also medicine as a field seems to be more mature and traditional.<p>Do some of you see it similarly or do you have different opinion? What do you think about it?","time":1511034106,"title":"Ask HN: Career change at

Here, you can watch how it works: \nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;lightkeeperpro.com&#x2F;instructional-videos&#x2F;\nYou&#x27;ll notice that the way it works is that you unplug a bulb (any bulb) from your broken&#x2F;one-bulb shorted set.  You plug in your set to Wall AC.  Then you plug in LightKeeper Pro into the socket for the bulb you just removed.  You pull the trigger (up to 30 times), now the lights come on (with the broken bulb showing itself because it&#x27;s not on).  How is this working?\nYou see, in Electrical Engineering 101, if you&#x27;ve got a short in the circuit (which you do if your in-series set of Christmas Tree lights is not working), then the whole set shouldn&#x27;t work.  What LightKeeper Pro seems to do then (I&#x27;m guessing), is to use a High-Voltage pulse to somehow get current to conduct THROUGH the non-functioning light. The non-functioning light is, after all (in addition to being an incandescent bulb) a Vacuum Tube, and in theory, if you put enough High Voltage through the Vacuum Tube, it will conduct current through it... is that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening here?  Is that the secret?  If it is, then I don&#x27;t really have a question -- problem solved... although it&#x27;s pretty damning evidence that Electrical Engineering 101 &#x2F; Electronics 101 -- both books and courses -- are well, <i>sort of wrong</i> with what they&#x27;re saying about short circuits...","time":1510870595,"title":"What is the electrical principle behind LightKeeper Pro?","type":"story"},{"by":"rahulshiv","descendants":94,"id":15717170,"kids":[15720735,15717719,15721160,15717614,15717705,15718379,15717434,15717721,15718333,15717880,15719557,15718243,15721433,15720462,15720467,15717638,15717877,15719040,15717934],"score":299,"time":1510870423,"title":"SQL Operations Studio","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/sqlopsstudio"},{"by":"Mrtierne","descendants":19,"id":15716979,"kids":[15717781,15717288,15718046,15717195,15719706,15718172,15717760],"score":50,"time":1510868903,"title":"Mashable to Sell to Ziff Davis","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/16/mashable-reportedly-selling-to-ziff-davis-for-about-50-million/"},{"by":"ingve","descendants":35,"id":15716990,"kids":[15717623,15717634,15717863,15720240,15717596,15717724,15719103,15718429,15721740],"score":358,"time":1510868971,"title":"Introduction to Computer Organization: ARM Assembly Language on the Raspberry Pi","type":"story","url":"http://bob.cs.sonoma.edu/IntroCompOrg-RPi/intro-co-rpi.html"},{"by":"AndreBaltazar","descendants":3,"id":15716906,"kids":[15718451,15717778,15718492],"score":34,"time":1510868369,"title":"What's new, Atlas?

There are extensions for vectorizing various modalities (users, items, documents, audio, images, etc) into one vector-space for similarity search and recommendation ([1], [2], [3]). There is extensive research on approximate nearest-neighbor searches ([4]).<p>For example: it&#x27;s possible to map users, songs, and artists into a common vector space ([1]). Two users who listen to similar songs have high similarity. Songs are recommended based on vector similarity to users. This pattern extends to many domains as long as there is a way to enforce similarity (likes, co-occurrences, etc.) to &quot;train&quot; the vectors.<p>In my experience, training the vectors is simpler than the engineering to efficiently query them (e.g. &quot;select the 10 nearest neighbors to vector with ID 123&quot;). This becomes expensive for large datasets, and correctly using the approximate nearest neighbor libraries is non-trivial.<p>I can&#x27;t find any database to insert vectors as they&#x27;re computed and then run queries against them. It seems often companies build a custom API on top of one of the approximate nearest neighbors libraries. Though the interesting queries seem pretty homogeneous.<p>Any ideas as to why none of the big DB players have an offering for this use-case? Like Algolia, but for vectors instead of text?

Investors look at the same decks and do the same number crunching. The ones that consistently choose the right companies have something that the other VCs do not.<p>3. The VCs that are good understand companies in a way that is beyond metrics. They are intuitive. You don’t want a VC that is obsessing over numbers. You want a VC that sees beyond and trusts themselves enough to take risk.<p>4. There are great partners at VC firms, but, ultimately, they have to serve that VC firm. Make sure the culture of that VC firm is a good one. That culture will impact that partner and that partner will impact you.<p>5. VCs don’t like to admit that they are primarily money people. The fancy offices, coffee, etc. is all about putting in small money and later getting out big money. Don’t kid yourself into thinking it is more than that.<p>6.

How much economic value could doing such a thing actually add even if you could ignore legacy? (I know, not enough to actually dump legacy, but how much? Enough to make you pay 20% more for a computer, if that were the price you had to pay? 10%?)<p>Speaking of future-proofing, how likely are AI advances (deep learning) to heavily profit from such a rethink?<p>I&#x27;m hoping to avoid any discussion of why companies haven&#x27;t done this and almost certainly won&#x27;t: because I think we all know why such a project might not be profitable or very practical. I still use Qwerty, after all.<p>I love Rust, but since existing OSes can be rewritten in Rust and that may very well happen, if only a bit at a time; I don&#x27;t see Rust as a decider, here. Of course, we want Rust, we just don&#x27;t have to restart to get it.<p>This query was sparked a bit by this quote from romaniv:\n&quot;One would think that in 2017 we would be using an OS that takes the best ideas from Xerox Park&#x2F;Star, Oberon and Cloud 9. At least on new devices (like tablets) which don&#x27;t have to keep backward compatibility.&quot;\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=15704806","time":1510803203,"title":"Ask HN: What should an ideal, all-new OS look like?","type":"story"},{"by":"Nuance","descendants":23,"id":15710051,"kids":[15710523,15711212,15710858,15710517,15710559,15710976,15710294],"score":99,"time":1510802523,"title":"Developing iOS 11 Apps with Swift","type":"story","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-11-apps-with-swift/id1309275316"},{"by":"lainon","descendants":95,"id":15710021,"kids":[15710348,15710479,15710267,15712091,15714433,15711866],"score":144,"time":1510802059,"title":"Towards Linux Kernel Memory Safety","type":"story","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06175v1"},{"by":"tvvocold","descendants":5,"id":15709905,"kids":[15714601,15709909,15718397],"score":8,"time":1510800199,"title":"Linuxbrew – The Homebrew package manager for Linux","type":"story","url":"http://linuxbrew.sh/"},{"by":"bexo5","descendants":3,"id":15709844,"kids":[15710090,15710338,15710052],"score":3,"text":"Hello guys i don&#x27;t know many programmers so i hope this is the right place to ask this question.

I was a little surprised to learn that I&#x27;ll need to pay an accountant thousands of dollars to file my corporate income taxes.

And if I use Bench [1], I&#x27;ll also need to spend $115 per month for bookkeeping.<p>I&#x27;m running a pretty simple SaaS app [2].

I feel like it shouldn&#x27;t be that hard to automate my bookkeeping and automatically file IRS Form 1120 (and Form 5472.)<p>I&#x27;m thinking about building a service that does this for small SaaS startups, and companies that make money from mobile apps.

malicious site&#x27; JS can&#x27;t read another site&#x27;s cookies even with Access-Control-Allow-Origin set to the malicious site and Access-Control-Allow-Credentials set to true.<p>I know setting allow-origin to the request origin is stupid, but am just wondering if I&#x27;m missing something that makes it easy to exploit the above CSRF prevention.","time":1510539867,"title":"Can “Cookie to

Thinking semi-open-plan, with quiet rooms for getting stuff done, then as I say semi-partitioned areas (not closed room) with a few desks for those working on each project.<p>Anyway, part of this idea involves moving between areas or projects. Laptops are one obvious answer - possibly outfitting desks with additional monitors, equipment as necessary. However we build fairly chunky (large) enterprise systems and sometimes running databases, FE tools, BE tools and the app (which might consist of a few components&#x2F;services) takes a lot of resources. In terms of performance, battery considerations, upgradability and cost, desktops have many advantages. Point being, for the cost of a killer laptop, the corresponding desktop machine wipes the floor with it and I&#x27;d favour the responsiveness and performance.<p>My question is, is there a viable tech solution to facilitate modern (backend&#x2F;fullstack) software development using some remote access&#x2F;terminal arrangement. In the same office - gigabit LAN etc - with dedicated machines hiding in a cupboard or rack somewhere.   BE&#x2F;fullstack dev is currently in Windows land.<p>I guess for me that means working with multiple monitors and ideally multiple desktops.<p>In years gone by I&#x27;ve seen Citrix, terminal services, RDC, VNC.. but I&#x27;d like to know if it&#x27;s viable for software engineering itself, and what kind of issues might crop up.

I just wanted to share some thought about what I’ve seen here.<p>1. The quality of the content, both stories and comments, has remained remarkably high. There have been times where I thought things were slipping but a few minutes on YouTube comments puts everything back in perspective.<p>2. There is just too much to learn and not enough time! On any given day there are more interesting stories to follow than I can possibly follow. Thankfully the comments are consistently good enough that I can read the comments before the actual story to check on credibility and accuracy.<p>3. I have learned to be more precise in what I say and give a little more latitude to others. Comments can get a bit pedantic. Not every comment needs to be a mathematical proof (although there have been many). I thought about creating a user named “PedanticMan” and going around harassing people about their grammar but I decided instead to try not to let the little things bother me.<p>4. There are a lot of smart, enthusiastic, knowledgeable people here. There have been so many comments with deeper explanations and links to extended content. Thank you to everyone who takes the time share.<p>5. Most topics deal with conflicting values and goals. Watching competent people argue different issues has been very instructive. For example, it’s possible to think “C++ is a horrible mess of a language” and “C++ is a powerful tool” at the same time.<p>6. Karma is strange to me. I’m a grown man with a rich life experience and I don’t care what random people on the internet think about me, there are no prizes for karma, and you can’t sell your points. Still, I notice. I get a stronger emotional reaction to it than seems rational.

The initial traffic spike was great (8000 new users in the first two days), but it quickly decayed and I&#x27;m left with a trickle.

Does the success on Product Hunt validate the product, or does the fact that interest died so quickly mean that I should move on? With the initial hype gone, is Product Hunt a dead channel for me now, or is there a way to leverage the success I had there?

I&#x27;m not entirely sure this is the right place to ask, but here goes anyway.<p>I feel like I&#x27;ve been doing a whole lot of learning about entrepreneurship, yet I never take the plunge and actually act, and I really don&#x27;t know how to get started.<p>A little bit about me: I graduated with a CS degree from a very strong engineering university in May, and I&#x27;m now a software engineer at a major tech company. I took lots of elective classes in school about entrepreneurship, from idea generation, to funding, to legal aspects of startups. I&#x27;ve been to plenty of talks and ask questions whenever I can at them, from people like Max Levchin (PayPal), Roger Dickey (Gigster), and Jess Lee (Sequoia Capital). At times I feel like I&#x27;m being quite proactive towards my goal of one day starting a startup...<p>And then I realize that I don&#x27;t output anything. I know backend and frontend web dev, infrastructure, some machine learning, and other odds and ends, but the most I find myself actually doing is writing little scripts to save myself a couple minutes here or there. I find myself so enthralled by consumer tech, and I have plenty of ideas, but I find it very hard to actually act on them. Any time I start to work on a project, I end up getting caught up trying to brainstorm how to build the perfect application, or I&#x27;ll start programming it but I&#x27;ll just keep adding more and more complexity before I even get an MVP.

computer instruction set architecture. In a way, it is still really a source code because there is still a translation step.<p>In the OLD days, we had assembly language which itself is just an ASCII based mneumonic representation of the underlying instruction set architecture. There is even closer to &#x27;bare metal&#x27; approach in machine language programming via the Machine Language Monitor (ML Monitor). This hexadecimal based representation. In fact, even the hexadecimal representation is an abstraction to a small step above the pure binary. When you enter hexadecimal digits, it is entered as keyboard keycode scan values. This then is translated into nybbles (4-bit units). So in essence this hexcode blob can be saved out into ASCII text files or it can be taken into the binary values.<p>If we were really coding in absolute bare metal, there would be three buttons. 0, 1, which will load a small buffer of binary digits of the keyboard and the enter button to submit the binary string into the larger memory. \n[pause]","time":1509968184,"title":"WebAssembly","type":"story"},{"by":"bloomca","descendants":458,"id":15634609,"kids":[15635617,15635620,15635644,15635860,15636454,15635542,15637526,15636389,15635903,15635392,15635640,15636310,15636850,15635503,15637012,15637030,15636879,15637755,15640358,15635661,15638718,15639252,15640189,15641896,15638345,15636917,15639663,15639248,15637603,15638932,15636884,15636815,15638043,15637368,15638400,15650030,15638695,15650023,15638394,15638325,15635626,15639733,15636638,15642960,15637516,15641327,15636749,15637078,15637270,15638632,15640439,15643007],"score":1187,"time":1509965500,"title":"Chrome breaks the Web","type":"story","url":"http://tonsky.me/blog/chrome-intervention/"},{"by":"alexpotato","descendants":16,"id":15634526,"kids":[15634620,15640480,15634835],"score":12,"time":1509963965,"title":"Why switching jobs is almost always a good idea","type":"story","url":"https://www.negotiatewith.us/blog/why-switching-jobs-is-almost-always-a-good-idea?aahr"},{"by":"reimertz","descendants":17,"id":15634388,"kids":[15634650,15635797,15637305,15634538,15644776,15644768,15635437,15634803],"score":104,"time":1509961462,"title":"The Magic of CSS","type":"story","url":"http://adamschwartz.co/magic-of-css/"},{"by":"iafrikan","descendants":21,"id":15634316,"kids":[15635037,15634632,15635433,15636299],"score":76,"time":1509960499,"title":"First-ever fiber optic cable between U.S. and India via Brazil and South Africa","type":"story","url":"https://www.iafrikan.com/2017/11/06/iox-cable-ltd-to-provide-first-subsea-route-between-u-s-and-india-via-brazil-and-south-africa/"},{"by":"Huhty","descendants":3,"id":15634280,"kids":[15634576,15634849,15634340],"score":3,"time":1509960142,"title":"Forget daylight saving, we should adopt a single, universal time, scientists say","type":"story","url":"http://www.sciencealert.com/forget-daylight-savings-adopt-a-single-universal-time-system"},{"by":"anikdas","descendants":3,"id":15634311,"kids":[15635510,15635961,15635441],"score":30,"time":1509960461,"title":"Disque: a distributed message broker","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/antirez/disque"},{"by":"vog","descendants":2,"id":15634254,"kids":[15634272,15634307],"score":2,"time":1509959802,"title":"Miniwebproxy - A web without dickbars, scroll jacking, chum boxes, popup video","type":"story","url":"https://www.tedunangst.com/flak/post/miniwebproxy"},{"by":"gyvastis","descendants":7,"id":15634117,"kids":[15635493,15634386,15634233,15635699,15635342,15639383,15636800,15636590],"score":11,"text":"Hi everybody.<p>I&#x27;m a web developer for over 6 years or so, but my focus is mainly backend.

I&#x27;m 29, and I&#x27;m seriously considering a career switch. Since I was 12 I&#x27;ve been glued to various screens. Saw the advent of the internet, the rise of smartphones, and not one but two AI booms. In 2010 I finished my undergraduate in Artificial Intelligence, and went into the big world (with a sidestep PhD in Epidemiology&#x2F;Genetics that I never finished). But here&#x27;s the thing, in all those years of programming (PHP, Javascript, Java, R, Clojure(Script)...roughly in that order) I&#x27;ve never made something that had actual users. I started off with various websites, which were fun, but not very profitable. Went on to do more &quot;complex&quot; things. A startup on web annotations that got nowhere, a system for preference based group formation (think meetings, parties, etc). Software that does Bayesian statistics for randomized controlled trials, web applications that do Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning on PDFs of academic literature. And now a vast tool that does semantic search and analytics on medical publications. The catch: no one uses them. And it&#x27;s silly, you can follow all the best practices, do everything right, and still it&#x27;s utterly useless. The past few months I&#x27;ve been wondering: is it really worth it? Where&#x27;s the fun in all these high-brow advanced pieces of software. I know, somewhere, that it&#x27;s about validation, finding a niche, etc. But really, where are the people who enjoy what I make? It would be nice for a change to find those. And, I&#x27;ve gotten increasingly cynical about it: most software is really just about nothing.

I don’t aim to master them; I just want to have a good (non-superficial) understanding of the overall picture, and to be moderately proficient in applying the principles&#x2F;tools.<p>For background, the projects are art (moderately skilled), data science (only interested in foundation&#x2F;background level) and reading (practise covering as much as possible, without sacrificing thoughtfulness.) There is also a new language but I’m keeping that very light (radio and penpal exchanges only.)<p>Even though they are meant to be recreational, and I have learning strategies for each of them, I sometimes struggle to juggle between them. I also have other commitments (I would say the ratio of commitment:recreational is 60:40). It’s a bit frustrating and I feel that it’s more of a personal flaw, as I know that many others have even less recreational time, yet successfully diligent with their learning projects.

It started out small but more people are starting to use it, and also starting to contribute, adding features; it&#x27;s starting to get some traction. This is a web based app (Python) that runs scripts to automate various infrastructure tasks, like building and patching servers. It&#x27;s backed by a database and is very tightly coupled (although it&#x27;s fairly modular, organized into packages, kind of like MVC). We had to move fast and there were just 2-4 of us, server admins learning to be developers, so we&#x27;ve never had a formal testing or CI&#x2F;CD process. We do use version control. We have a dev branch, which is everyone&#x27;s upstream, and once we&#x27;re happy we merge that to a master branch and that&#x27;s considered &quot;production&quot;.<p>We know we need to get to CI&#x2F;CD, unit tests, all the DevOps&#x2F;Agile&#x2F;XP stuff. I&#x27;m thinking since we don&#x27;t have any tests at all, before we refactor the code to support unit tests or start integrating with Jenkins (CI), we should start with at least adding some high level tests. Maybe integration or UI tests... just something to make sure we&#x27;re not breaking things as we clean up the code base.<p>Some people have suggested we start with getting it into Jenkins and set up an automated build (CI) system first, then start adding tests. I&#x27;m thinking start with tests first.<p>People are using it now, but there are a few bugs. Most of them are integration related - race conditions, DB sessions overlapping, things that come up when it&#x27;s running under Gunicorn and handling a lot of requests. What&#x27;s the best roadmap to get a legacy code base up to snuff to be considered a real product?<p>[edit] I should mention, everyone who develops on this runs it on systems that are almost identical to production. We use a requirements.txt, and the OS is at the same patch level and everything. Giving contributors a way to run tests locally against their changes on their dev boxes, with a testing framework, would be almost as good as running the app in production.

I&#x27;ve only lightly dabbled in it, and the most frequent opinion I hear is that C++ is more &quot;necessary evil&quot; than &quot;a delight to work with&quot;. So I started looking at alternatives, having used none of them before.<p>Go has built-in functionality to make Go code callable from Objective C and Java. But it&#x27;s still the Go runtime underneath, just proxied out to native.<p>By comparison, Haxe can output both C++ and Java. Presumably it has some cleverness built into C++ to handle garbage collection, but it sounds like the output is more &quot;pure&quot; than Go would be.<p>But does that even matter? Haxe definitely feels like a more familiar language to write, but a more obscure language in terms of raw popularity (but it has generics!). Go feels more alien (and I&#x27;m concerned that it doesn&#x27;t seem to let you explicitly handle threads, which has bitten me on iOS before), but everything I&#x27;m reading about how it&#x27;s structured, testing etc. just feels very <i>sensible</i>.<p>Has anyone used any of these options to make a cross-platform library?

The quicklisp seems to install everything in a global folder. I am looking something closer to npm or bundler that stays local to my project. Qi seems like it. But I am still confused, what are my options here?<p>- What web frameworks are recommended. I don&#x27;t need a full fledged framework, I need something micro, that just get&#x27;s the job done. What are my options here and what&#x27;s most recommended?<p>- For storage database I want to use something embedded and fast. SQLite is one option, what are my other options? Are there any &quot;pure lisp&quot; implementations of Key&#x2F;Value stores?<p>- For hosting I know I can get it running on a VPS.

Our overall goal is to replace petroleum-based chemicals with purer, plant-derived substitutes. We’re going after peroxides first because the process to make them is petroleum-dependent and quite atrocious.<p>Peroxides are everywhere: they’re used to disinfect and clean many of the surfaces you encounter everyday; they’re used to make the plastics in the chairs you’re sitting in; they’re used to etch the a7 chip on your iphones, they’re even used to clean the food and water that you consumed today. But the dirty secret is that it’s extremely expensive to make peroxide, costing up to $100M to make a small facility, with an end product that’s contaminated with a high level of dangerous impurities. Worse, because of the petroleum based chemistry used to make peroxide, one facility explodes per year!<p>So we made something better. I was finishing my MD&#x2F;PhD and discovered an enzyme in pancreatic cancer that could efficiently produce hydrogen peroxide from sugars. At the same time my co-founder Sean was was at MIT finishing up his chemE PhD on the production of hydrogen peroxide on nanoparticles. We came together and used crispr&#x2F;cas9 technology to scale up our process and figured out how to convert plant sugars into hydrogen peroxide for a safer and cheaper process that doesn’t explode. You may be asking “what happens to all the carbons in the carbohydrate backbone?!”, well we actually use the carbohydrate itself has a catalyst, regenerating through a hydrogenation process. So the only inputs in the system are H2 + O2 and the only output is H2O2.<p>We’ve made the world’s first peroxide made from plants, calling our product BIO-Peroxide, and released a Bioperoxide wipes line called Ode to Clean: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.odetoclean.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.odetoclean.com</a>.<p>Our tech enables:<p>1.) CRISPR&#x2F;Cas9 means enzymes can be readily optimized and mass-manufactured very inexpensively. We can continuously engineer and release new enzyme catalysts like software. This means biotech can now compete against traditional chemical processing.<p>2.) Direct consequence of 1. is that chemical synthesis via enzymes will be cheaper and more efficient than traditional fermentation processes<p>3.) Traditional petrochemical process design is not suited for enzymatic reactions, and neither is fermentation. We need new reactor systems that are bespoke for each enzyme. Enzyme-reactor fit.<p>4.) Because enzymes are so efficient and our new reactors maximize enzyme efficiency even further, the entire chemical industry can be made smaller through micromanufacturing. Economies of scale no longer need to be so excessive.<p>This leads into Solugen&#x27;s MASTER PLAN!! (muahahha) \nPhase 1, we developed our own enzyme and our own custom reactor for it. We can now make plant-based products such as hydrogen peroxide that can compete against petroleum processing, even on a small scale (see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.odetoclean.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.odetoclean.com</a>). Phase 2, we will partner with other biotech companies to bring our reactor technologies onsite. Here we do paid pilots, design and sell a process package, offer technical support during installation, and we sell our engineered enzymes to the customers. Phase 3, we move into other chemical verticals, Phase 4, become a general chemical company that we want to model after 3M where there are both significant b2b and b2c revenue streams.<p>Really looking forward to a discussing with the community and getting feedback!

I&#x27;m a 29-year-old programmer who left my SV job four-odd years ago to pursue a life of travel and indie development (at least until my savings ran out). Travel-wise, things have just been peachy. Career-wise, I&#x27;ve accomplished a whole lot compared to what I was doing before, including developing a bunch of small&#x2F;medium-sized native iOS and OSX apps (one of which grossed $10k+), publishing a (simple == sub 1k line) open source project that has close to a thousand stars, blogging about technical topics (nothing too fancy), and implementing&#x2F;blogging a very interesting CS research paper.

People can borrow money for building buildings. The mortgage is the building itselve.<p>What happened, the buildings are never completed ( 50% ) and the rest of the money goes to the owner. The bank takes the unfinished building and it just stays unfinished.<p>They do other things of course, but since the annual growth of 8% is always met. There is no collapse.<p>Now, China is expanding globally to do the same. They give loans to countries ( expecting them not to be able to pay back) for creating infrastructure there. In return, they receive monopolies when the loans can&#x27;t be paid back ( much bigger debt for China).<p>BUT: the annual growth is met, while expanding their power.<p>Now i&#x27;m starting to get worried.

This replaces the slow, error prone alternative of uploading Excel files for bulk payments or manually reconciling payments received via bank transfers. Using Cashfree, payouts that took more than a day to process, happen instantly and independent of banking hours.<p>We help businesses like fintech platforms and marketplaces to easily setup custom payment flows to receive and disburse money.<p>Cashfree is being used for automated payouts and collections for use cases like -<p>* Supply chain collections by distributors<p>* Crowdfunding campaigns<p>* Marketplace vendor settlements<p>* Instant deposits and withdrawals at bitcoin exchanges<p>* Payroll for on-demand economy workers<p>* Loan disbursal and repayment by lenders<p>* Invoice payments at Modern ERP and Accounting tools<p>* Instant refunds (versus 5-7 days presently)<p>We started Cashfree to help e-commerce customers pay for their COD orders on delivery, through their mobile. While running Cashfree, we faced challenges around settling payouts to our partner merchants. Our partner merchants too shared similar problems and it made us dive deeper. We found no other payments company solving this common problem and decided to build a solution.<p>We support RESTful APIs that can be integrated easily with tech stack of a business (a) to carry out payouts and (b) automatically reconcile inbound bank transfers. Our solutions are built on top of banking infrastructure and are compliant with the regulations.<p>Would love to answer your questions about Cashfree and look forward to discuss anything on payments and bank transfers.","time":1508735309,"title":"Launch HN: Cashfree (YC S17) – Automated Payouts and Bank Transfers for India","type":"story"},{"by":"rdoherty","descendants":59,"id":15530716,"kids":[15531372,15531102,15531205,15531523,15531585,15531594,15531304,15531841],"score":62,"time":1508732721,"title":"Why do people keep giving Magic Leap money?","type":"story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/22/16505430/magic-leap-augmented-reality-temasek-funding-investment-why"},{"by":"digital55","descendants":26,"id":15530587,"kids":[15533815,15532593,15542683,15534390],"score":82,"time":1508730675,"title":"Scientists make rare achievement in study of antimatter","type":"story","url":"https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/scientists-make-rare-achievement-in-study-of-antimatter"},{"by":"jonbaer","descendants":11,"id":15530516,"kids":[15532941,15532424,15533803,15533716],"score":82,"time":1508729597,"title":"Photons pair up like superconducting electrons","type":"story","url":"http://www.nature.com/news/photons-pair-up-like-superconducting-electrons-1.22868"},{"by":"vinchuco","descendants":15,"id":15530630,"kids":[15531904,15534526,15532387,15532173,15531947],"score":56,"time":1508731389,"title":"Solving Problems with MiniZinc","type":"story","url":"http://blog.jpalardy.com/posts/problem-solving-with-minizinc/"},{"by":"yamaneko","descendants":14,"id":15530147,"kids":[15530150,15532447,15533895,15532950,15532966,15531699,15531555,15532486],"score":87,"time":1508723661,"title":"Turning Corners into Cameras: Principles and Methods","type":"story","url":"http://people.csail.mit.edu/klbouman/cornercameras.html"},{"by":"asnyc","descendants":30,"id":15530166,"kids":[15545257,15531866,15541096,15534965,15535118,15534392,15547453,15543573,15547304,15533399,15531794,15541600],"score":21,"text":"- Or will all invites&#x2F;rejects be send out on October 24th itself ?<p>- Do the late applications start getting looked at after October 24th - or only after first round interviews are complete ?","time":1508723990,"title":"Ask HN: Have you received a response for YC Winter 2018 application?","type":"story"},{"by":"fern12","descendants":18,"id":15530132,"kids":[15530698,15530591,15530601,15530665,15530654,15530625,15538880,15530696],"score":36,"time":1508723427,"title":"In defense of cash: why we should bring back the $500 note and other big bills","type":"story","url":"https://theconversation.com/in-defense-of-cash-why-we-should-bring-back-the-500-note-and-other-big-bills-85880"},{"by":"do_spinup","descendants":8,"id":15530017,"kids":[15530699,15533523,15544511,15534036,15536466,15558741],"score":5,"text":"My SaaS is going to be priced at much more than $5&#x2F;mo, but the computation involved is fairly cheap.

How should I use the money to grow the business?<p>Longer version:<p>Moved to Japan two years ago. Started watching cheesy soap operas to get better at the language. Got an idea from one about a marriage contract-based dating site. Found a great domain, filed a patent, and hacked out a basic site one weekend.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keiyakukekkon.com<p>Over the last few months I&#x27;ve been working on it in my spare time. I made a blog (one of my posts made it to the front page here actually) and did some promotion on Twitter. With very little marketing we&#x27;ve managed to get about 200 users to register and tens of thousands of site visitors. Mostly I think it&#x27;s just people stumbling on the domain which was a popular term on Japanese twitter.<p>My Japanese friend recently suggested I apply to the Japan Finance Corporation for startup funding. There is an increasing amount of accelerators in Tokyo and we figured with some money we could invest in improving the site and marketing. Well lo and behold, the representatives liked our site, and immediately gave us 3 million yen (A little under $30,000. A yen is comparable to a penny). The government as you know is very worried about the low birthrate so they want to support businesses that help people get married.<p>So it&#x27;s not a ton of money but I have zero experience so I am not sure how to use it. I&#x27;d like to make some improvements to the site and also do marketing both online and IRL.<p>Anyway let me know what you guys think is a good way to proceed.<p>Also, if anyone is interested in the project and wants to help out, just shoot me an email. Could use technical people, designers, marketers, investors, and even a cofounder if I find someone really good.

have recently accepted a remote position and will be starting next month.<p>I visited their offices to pick my laptop up and meet the team.<p>A few things were raised that seemed odd to me or may actually be warning signs.<p>I requested a ThinkPad and got no answer. Yesterday they presented me with a Dell, which is fine, though the screen resolution is 1366x768. I am not really comfortable working with this since everything is very bloated, and I know that it will annoy me long-term.\nMy work is very detailed, so higher resolution does a lot for my ability to work optimally.<p>They do not cover travel expenses. When travelling for them it would likely be in excess of about $100+ a week, though this is in my local currency, which is worth a lot less.\nTheir excuse was that it will be on my tax and that I could claim it back from there, but that puts the burden on me to cover expenses up-front, which they do not make provision for in my salary, and also puts the burden on me to claim it from our slow and shitty tax system.<p>The company is very small but leaders very resistant to change. They currently communicate via e-mail and WhatsApp (???), though I wish to get something like Slack in-place to aide us that work remotely.\nI asked about this and the leaders were very hesitant and did not know what or how Slack works in the first place.<p>They are slow in setting my company facilities up.\nThey use G-Suite, so creating me a mailbox should not take days.<p>They do not have any formal or even informal onboarding despite existing for 16 years.\nNowhere is it mentioned how one can apply for leave, and I had to ask.

Hope you enjoy it and please, feedback would be very much appreciated.<p>Repo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jscriptcoder&#x2F;live-coder\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jscriptcoder&#x2F;live-coder</a><p>Fran","time":1508414721,"title":"Show HN: LiveCoder","type":"story"},{"by":"wallflower","descendants":98,"id":15507155,"kids":[15509781,15509686,15510033,15509859,15509697,15510113,15509819,15511821,15509838,15510650,15510892,15509884,15511249,15509616,15509836,15509646],"score":93,"time":1508414665,"title":"Google’s Founders Wanted to Shape a City – Toronto Is Their Chance","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/upshot/taxibots-sensors-and-self-driving-shuttles-a-glimpse-at-an-internet-city-in-toronto.html"},{"by":"r3bl","descendants":9,"id":15507177,"kids":[15507523,15507306,15507327],"score":15,"time":1508414900,"title":"Ubuntu 17.10 (Artful Aardvark) Release Notes","type":"story","url":"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArtfulAardvark/ReleaseNotes"},{"by":"laktek","descendants":120,"id":15507181,"kids":[15507683,15507435,15507774,15507287,15509586,15507276,15509221,15507259,15507248,15538937,15509039,15508224,15507355,15512962,15509298,15508671,15510249,15508450,15507859,15508539,15509371,15507236,15508751,15507606,15512822,15507796,15522979,15513286,15511353,15508085,15511131,15518609,15507387,15507308],"score":195,"time":1508414978,"title":"Show HN: Screen.rip – API for capturing web screenshots","type":"story","url":"http://screen.rip"},{"by":"kercker","descendants":28,"id":15507141,"kids":[15511931,15511338,15515927,15512400],"score":179,"time":1508414543,"title":"A View of Mathematics (2005) [pdf]","type":"story","url":"http://www.alainconnes.org/docs/maths.pdf"},{"by":"mntmn","descendants":57,"id":15507122,"kids":[15509148,15507948,15508789,15509431,15507905,15509915,15507777,15511004,15509552,15511501,15507528,15507610,15514773,15511380,15510247,15508272,15507618,15507666,15509470],"score":199,"time":1508414311,"title":"MNT Reform: DIY portable computer","type":"story","url":"http://mntmn.com/reform"},{"by":"pedromsantos","descendants":36,"id":15507081,"kids":[15509402,15512411,15513831,15509864],"score":69,"time":1508413840,"title":"Functional calisthenics","type":"story","url":"https://codurance.com/2017/10/12/functional-calisthenics/"},{"by":"baybal2","descendants":2,"id":15507009,"kids":[15507152,15507099],"score":2,"text":"So that&#x27;s the question.

Key Reinstallation Attack (aka KRACK) is a network vulnerability that has recently been discovered by Mathy Vanhoef of the imec-DistriNet research group. What’s the big deal about this one? It turns out to threaten every modern protected WiFi network and all devices connected to one.<p>Technicalities<p>KRACK abuses a massive weakness in WPA2, a protocol used to protect all modern secured WiFi networks. If you are using a protected WiFi network, you can be affected. An attacker can intercept, read, and in some cases manipulate the data transferred via the network. This includes CC numbers and passwords, emails, chat messages, photos – basically anything.<p>The discovered vulnerability stems from a 4-way handshake confirmation process of the WPA2, executed when you try to join a WiFi network. During this process, parties check if the entered password is correct, and exchange encryption keys. The latter will then be used to encrypt the traffic between a device and a wireless network.<p>The third handshake normally transfers the encryption key and confirms its receipt. If the reception is not acknowledged, the internet access point will resend the key. Malefactors can intercept these messages and transform them, resulting in your protected WiFi connection using a compromised key.<p>Due to specifics of Linux and Android, they are especially prone to KRACK. According to Mr. Vanhoef, “currently 41% of Android devices are vulnerable to this exceptionally devastating variant of our attack.”<p>Warding off KRACK dealers<p>First and foremost, this is a patchable problem, so make sure that your software is updated. Though releasing updates takes time so no way to know how long you will have to wait for it.<p>Mathy Vanhoef mentioned HTTPS may provide an additional layer of protection against such attacks too. Finally, use a VPN services, like VPN Unlimited, as an additional level of security.","time":1508400909,"title":"You are Probably under KRACK","type":"story"},{"by":"adzicg","descendants":19,"id":15506189,"kids":[15529515,15530627,15528583,15530858,15534077],"score":92,"time":1508399897,"title":"Serverless computing: economic and architectural impact","type":"story","url":"https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/10/19/serverless-computing-economic-and-architectural-impact/"},{"by":"sethbannon","descendants":15,"id":15506150,"kids":[15508430,15507776,15507159],"score":69,"time":1508399398,"title":"F.D.A.

I try to be open-minded, and I&#x27;ve accepted that there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;ll ever truly be an expert in every aspect of SW engineering.<p>Four months ago, I joined a new team at a new company (my previous tech was purchased, and I wanted to move on to other projects). Writing code with this team has been a really difficult experience. Every change that I make I get pep8&#x27;d and abused on style. With each PR that I make, a long thread (&gt;50 back-n-forths) ensues with comments like &quot;let&#x27;s put the calls in this file instead of that file&quot;, &quot;let&#x27;s actually put the code here in this file&quot;, &quot;your code should be under 80 characters long&quot;, etc. What&#x27;s annoying is that this codebase is a mess, and these comments appear to me as hazing as they are not uniformly applied to others: lots of inconsistent styles; really complicated class hierarchies; major violations of YAGNI; major violations of pep8. The codebase size is &lt;3K LOC, and I&#x27;ve worked on codebases with 100Ks of lines; so it&#x27;s really frustrating to deal with the nitpicking on something that seemingly wastes everybody&#x27;s time, and doesn&#x27;t provide opportunities for growth or learning.<p>So being a good new employee, I&#x27;ve asked for a style guide and was handed this link: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.python.org&#x2F;dev&#x2F;peps&#x2F;pep-0008&#x2F;.
