I also think that reinforcement deep learning is the ML algorithm best suited to this problem because it mirrors how humans route: in discreet steps that can be encoded as actions like go up 10mm, go down one layer, etc,  guided by visual feedback and a design rule checker.<p>I&#x27;d greatly appreciate any advice or papers&#x2F;projects that show how to use reinforcement learning for problems different from playing a video game. What I need is a significant deviation from OpenAI gym solutions and without a lot of experience in machine learning, it&#x27;s hard to  know where to look and what terminology is relevant.

Tech startups really excite me, but I’m trying to figure out how I can contribute with my science&#x2F;medical background.<p>I have three tech startup ideas which I’ve built prototypes for (didn’t use programming, just simple mockups.) So I’m thinking I need to teach myself programming, learn programming from a Masters’ program, or join up with a CTO to help bring these ideas to life.<p>School route: If I went back to school I would pursue either a MS in Computer Science or a fellowship in Biodesign (biomedical engineering at Stanford.)

They shape society.  From the printing press to the earliest peer-reviewed scientific journals of the Royal Society, from the wireless to radio to television, each new communications technology has evolved with it social institutions that govern how people communicate on that platform.  This is not about politics -- Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative.  It is about the rules of debate, whether a communications technology facilitates or destroys a culture where argument is grounded in evidence, reason, and respect.<p>You are not just building a communications platform.  You are building the future.<p>And right now, the future you are building has a lot of swastikas in it.  It&#x27;s a future where bald-faced lies get more shares than evidence-based argument.

When time is critical in a project I just install Atom or something with a sidebar (it makes a huge difference to me) and move on with my life.<p>I want to improve. Specifically, how can I productively edit multiple files simultaneously in a larger codebase? Should I use tmux panes and windows? Or vim split views? Should I use a sidebar plugin for vim? Any other workflow tips?<p>Should I even use vim at all?

Around 40h of school and 16h of work each week (i have a contract with a swedish start up). It&#x27;s been working out fine but I&#x27;m starting to grow frustrated with this path. I started studying to ensure a safe future. I have by no means any hard time finding work and I&#x27;ve been doing things for major ad agencies and some major brands (nike, samsung, wwf, mentos). I just thought I needed a bachelor to be safe in the future.<p>Now I&#x27;ve just been at websummit in portugal and I&#x27;ve just missed a weeks worth of studies but I can already feel how much I need to do this week to get everything done. Quite frankly I&#x27;m sick of the workload.

They turned me down but I&#x27;m thinking of trying again, or at least match what the other company offered me (15% more) when I was a total beginner.\nHow do I do this without sounding like I&#x27;m giving them some kind of ultimatum?

Quietly, because my friends seemed geniunely upset. Amused, because I liked Mr Orange shaking things up. Sometimes things got racist or sexist or absurdist. But then, so is Chapelle, Louis CK, and half the stand-up I enjoy.<p>Then I was concerned. Accusations of racism and sexism and bigotry started to fly. Comparisons were made to idiocracy. Sure, some Trump supporters are bigoted neo-Nazis, but most are not. Trump&#x27;s supporters have valid concerns and agendas. And I saw friends shout them down as anti-women, anti-gay, anti-semetic. I was more concerned about the divisiveness and name-calling than the election result itself.<p>Now that hate is spilling into the real world. An aged white man was physically assaulted by Hillary supporters. Trump supporters are manhandling women and yelling at minorities to leave the country. Neither side is innocent. And both sides need to do something. A young black man won&#x27;t listen to a white person. Just like a young white man won&#x27;t listen to someone colored. Their mothers, uncles, friends, even strangers from their own backgrounds are another story. Most Trump supporters aren&#x27;t racist, sexist or bigoted. Most Hillary supporters aren&#x27;t violent, angry, terrorist-sympathizers. Now is the time to show that. Now is the time to speak up against any hateful act, especially among your fellow voters. Now is the time to let those hateful, unthinking, cowardly brutes know that what they&#x27;re doing is not ok.<p>Instead of condemning the other side (because honestly, they won&#x27;t listen), we need to condemn the hatred in our own ranks. Because I bet you&#x27;ve got more in common with the average voter on the other side, than the cowardly thug stalking the streets looking for a lone victim to target. Regardless of who we voted for, we all love, we all hurt, and we all want to live better lives. We&#x27;re all human.

You can host it anywhere even from your own localhost server. The app is just plain html and javascript, with no server-side processing at all, no tracking, no logging.<p>Steps: \n1-Grant Seecret.io permission to connect to Twitter. (Just like Facebook connect). Twitter uses Oauth 1.0a (srsly?) which doesn&#x27;t support serverless auth so we integrated Oauth.io to handle it. Read about it at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oauth.io but they are a trusted Oauth 1 proxy service.<p>2-Seecret then gens an RSA key with a long passphrase saved locally. You can change the passphrase and even delete it (and the key) from local storage. If you delete these you&#x27;ll need to reimport them each time you use the app. To read more about concerns and approaches re: local browser storage of keys etc read our FAQ at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seecret.net&#x2F;faq.html<p>3-Send encrypted msgs over Twitter to your existing contacts!<p>The code for Seecret is fully auditable and the app uses  Subresource Integrity Checks for all dependencies.

I intend on launching the app in the New Year, at my alma mater, when the students get back after Christmas.<p>Now in order to reduce friction for activating new users and getting them into the app as soon as possible, I was intending on having only signup&#x2F;login via Facebook. Students will likely think of this as no big deal, it&#x27;s faster and would rather this than have to fill out an email, password, confirm password along with email verification etc.<p>Not to mention, this would have several additional benefits such as being able to reduce the number of fake accounts and allowing the users to share posts to other existing social media such as FB&#x2F;Instagram&#x2F;Twitter. Anything to get the word out and kick start the viral cycle.<p>However, it&#x27;s struck me that IF this app is successful, a big if of course, then I will be relying on Facebook for all my userbase authentication, and as a result, they will own my user account data? In a best case scenario, let&#x27;s say that this becomes a competitor of facebook, couldn&#x27;t Facebook just shut down my access to their API, I&#x27;d be at their mercy right? They could snatch away my whole userbase and shut me down. This is all hypotheticals of course.<p>Is there any way around this? Should I be looking at creating my own system or relying on just email&#x2F;password authentication?

HN is no different.<p>I come to these sites to read tech news. Some of them are relevant; climate change on a tech blog? Sure, I guess. weather.com could easily cover it though. GM laying off employees? Sure, the automotive industry has to do with tech in a big way now a days. But there are other blogs &#x2F; news sites &#x2F; forums where these things can be discussed.<p>Blogs should go back to complaining about missing ESC keys and headphone jacks.<p>I (and I think we as a whole) need a break from politics. As a web developer, it&#x27;s hard to avoid these sites. I come to HN to learn about new languages, tech, etc... Same with other tech blogs. So to come here and have to parse through political posts also is really a PITA. Yes yes, I know - if I don&#x27;t wanna see it, don&#x27;t go there &#x2F; read it. But it&#x27;s everywhere now. Is it important? Absolutely. But does it need to be on a tech blog &#x2F; site? I don&#x27;t think it does.","time":1478788093,"title":"Ask HN: Do we really need this here?","type":"story"},{"by":"joubert","descendants":2,"id":12920581,"kids":[12921293,12921723],"score":2,"time":1478788099,"title":"Peter Thiel’s Oddly Conventional Defense of Trump","type":"story","url":"http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/peter-thiels-oddly-conventional-defense-of-trump"},{"by":"dublinclontarf","descendants":4,"id":12920583,"kids":[12920698,12920871,12920699,12920692],"score":2,"text":"I&#x27;ve recently been told that my performance is not up to expectations, that the number of features I&#x27;m getting merged into the develop branch is too low (and not of significant complexity) in comparison to my colleagues(it&#x27;s not clear whether this is fact or opinion).<p>The concern my managers have is that I am very productive when I have a free hand but seem to progress slowly when I have to interact and integrate with the rest of the team(who I get along well with).<p>For example, in the React project we recently began I was quite quick in getting the UI components built and semi functional, progress was fast and noticeable(I was easily the highest performer). The same was true when we did a short practice React project prior to starting this one.<p>Now that we have formalised a develop branch, each feature begins as a ticket(pre-decided and handed down), features are then worked on as a branch and must be rebased before being merged. Only our CTO has merge abilities and he reviews all tickets before doing so.<p>It can take days to get branches merged as the CTO is quite busy and codes himself (on a different project)as well as other non-coding CTO tasks, if comments are made they must be resolved or addressed before moving ahead. Nothing gets accepted without tests (actions, reducers, ui components, integration tests etc.) and none of this code is currently live.<p>I do move along a lot faster when I&#x27;m not attempting to get features merged one ticket at a time, waiting for feedback, and using test driven development etc. although my code is not unreliable or brittle.<p>I got the impression that merely having comments made on my pull requests was not a good thing (a sign that I wasn&#x27;t doing things right).

I have problems in both these areas. Regarding reading: I don&#x27;t know which tech blogs&#x2F;people to follow, I don&#x27;t know the best books to read and I overall have the awful habit of skimming though articles when I stumble upon them. I don&#x27;t know why.<p>Regarding coding on my free time: I just don&#x27;t know what to code. I know people say to solve problems you face everyday, I just don&#x27;t know any. I try to make stuff like reinventing the wheel but that does not really inspire or motivate me. I know that probably reading more would help me with this.<p>I think the fundamental problem underlying all these is that I don&#x27;t have any real interests. All throughout highschool and college my only real interest besides finishing my degree was (is) playing video games. I can&#x27;t finish any technical article, follow and participate in discussions in reddit or here because I just don&#x27;t read articles in depth, and thus I can&#x27;t think and formulate opinions on these subjects. What screwed am I?<p>The technologies that I think I might enjoy learning would be: the JS ecosystem (react, angular, ES6, etc), learning more about Rails development besides the basics which I know have a good grasp on, maybe learn more about app development (I&#x27;m fairly comfortable with Java) and doing somekind of desktop applications (electron or C++?).

work with a professor,Dr. Kumar Eswaran, on several computer science problems especially in the neural network field. He is the quintessential prof who is always lost in thought and interested in solving unsolvable problems. So I was pleasantly surprised last week when he told me that he had found a proof for the Riemann Hypothesis.<p>The Professor was able to crack the Riemann Hypothesis because he used the properties of primes and analytic continuation and had a new way of handling slowly converging series and was able to use (at crucial point) concepts borrowed from Donald Knuth regarding random numbers and random sequences. Knuth had said that for any sequence to be truly random it has to be non-cyclic. The proof required to show that a sequence of +1&#x27;s and -1&#x27;s , obtained from the prime factorization of the infinite sequence of integers, had to be shown to be random and to  asymptotically behave like the tosses of a coin.<p>Though I am good at computers and math, I am not an authority in math.

Now, at 31 I feeling what is point of marriage and all? I have asked so many women out only to face rejection. I am Indian and have tried arrange marriage route as well. But, only women who seem interested are 30+ or plus size women. Nothing wrong being plus size but my expectation from my future wife is just being in shape and educated enough.

Except for whatever reason, both laptops get hung instead.<p>Has anyone experienced this issue? Any tips? Hibernate has always worked great for me up until these two laptops.<p>Both are running Debian Unstable.\nThis is the current `uname -a`: `Linux Babel 4.7.0-1-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.7.8-1 (2016-10-19) x86_64 GNU&#x2F;Linux`<p>I am a software developer by trade and wouldn&#x27;t mind digging through source code if it came to that, but I&#x27;m just not even sure where to start.","time":1478458110,"title":"Ask HN: Any tips on debugging Linux hibernate issues?","type":"story"},{"by":"cx1000","descendants":151,"id":12885980,"kids":[12886830,12886449,12886670,12886237,12886231,12886963,12886526,12886247,12886259,12886599,12886162,12886452,12886326,12886232,12886739,12888002,12886344,12886765,12886210,12887027,12887982,12889566,12886945,12892203,12886466,12889254,12887619,12886897,12886627,12892189,12886308,12887594,12886927],"score":455,"time":1478451886,"title":"Intercooler.js – Making AJAX as easy as anchor tags","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/LeadDyno/intercooler-js"},{"by":"ohjeez","descendants":25,"id":12885843,"kids":[12886099,12887312,12887510,12895010,12886277,12887313,12886798,12886654],"score":153,"time":1478450381,"title":"Books Warren Buffett thinks you should read","type":"story","url":"http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/21-books-warren-buffett-thinks-you-should-read-20161103-gshv25.html"},{"by":"auza","descendants":23,"id":12885739,"kids":[12886644,12886586,12886987,12887803,12887724,12886529],"score":66,"time":1478449194,"title":"Gmail Account Hijacking Vulnerability","type":"story","url":"http://blog.securityfuse.com/2016/11/gmail-account-hijacking-vulnerability.html"},{"by":"ambrop7","descendants":4,"id":12885738,"kids":[12886079,12886028,12964913],"score":2,"text":"Here&#x27;s an interesting experiment that anyone with myopia (near-sightedness) can do.

I&#x27;ve been surprised to find that every shop I discuss with is adamant that straight native code (Swift for iOS and Java for Android) is the only way to go.  Opinions range from, &quot;Hybrid frameworks are useless, and will give you a noticeably inferior app,&quot; to the slightly less extreme, &quot;You might save a bit of time using a hybrid framework initially, but you&#x27;ll pay for it over time as you have difficulty adapting to changes in the platforms and adding features.&quot;<p>Coming from a web develop background, this obviously sounds a bit backwards to me.  But all of the teams I&#x27;ve talked to have great portfolios, and have build beautiful apps for major companies, so I have to think they have some idea what they&#x27;re doing.  Is it possible they <i>all</i> have this position just because of inertia?  I could see there being significant tradeoffs with a hybrid framework like PhoneGap, but what about something like React Native that (at least, as far as I understand) allows you to use native code wherever necessary?

startup in The Netherlands we are worried that Trump might actually win... I would like to ask the HN community whether other people, inside the US but especially outside - want to help push the voting in the right direction. Not that we are such fans about Hillary. Its because we do not want Trump to be in charge of the US. Not even for a month. Not for a day. I ask this to people especially outside the US because as non-US people, I can imagine many feel frustrated that they cannot participate in this election. I do not want to wake up hearing Trump has won and I didn&#x27;t try anything to prevent it.<p>My idea was to build a voting decision wizard (something like Typeform), targeted to people that want to vote Trump. To ask them if they are sure and to let them think it through. It should contain a lot of humor to go viral (this election proves again that facts alone wont get us far).<p>I am not that naive that I think we can change many Trump supporters to vote Hillary. I do think that something like this could push undecided people to vote Hillary AND to push Hillary voters to really use their vote. Nothing is built yet, and I am sure there are many other things that could help us with this mission. If there are other ideas out there, lets hear them! Who is helping!? We need devs, designers, illustrators and many many marketeers to get this viral.<p>I suggest we need something finished this Sunday. With all the tools to work together remotely I think we can make this work. Even if it wont go viral it can make up for a nice weekend project.

It also applies to contractors that worked on a single project for us for 183 days or more.  The issue is, that now means having to collect and pay sales and income taxes in that state.<p>The &quot;may&quot; part is important, because each state has very different rules to what they consider having a &quot;nexus&quot; in their state.  They also have different and complex rules as to what is taxable when it comes to software.<p>Did you know that SAAS apps aren&#x27;t taxable in Michigan, if &quot;no code is transferred to the customer&quot;, but if an &quot;incidental&quot; amount is transferred, it is? (as determined by the Department of Treasury)...

Out of all my apps I think I would miss iTerm the most.","time":1477903778,"title":"Ask HN: Disappointed by the new Macbook, what alternatives do we have?","type":"story"},{"by":"ivanceras","descendants":16,"id":12835044,"kids":[12837755,12836227,12840176,12837077,12841597,12837547],"score":62,"time":1477903019,"title":"Show HN: Spongedown – markdown renderer with ascii diagram support","type":"story","url":"https://ivanceras.github.io/spongedown/"},{"by":"demirb","descendants":11,"id":12835000,"kids":[12838289,12836983,12835830,12843886,12836892,12836634,12835352,12843875,12841075,12835383,12835422],"score":11,"text":"I tend to get distracted and check hn, reddit when compiling.

And if smart nimble startups hire 10x engineers and throw them through intense gauntlets, yet still fail, does that then shift the responsibility of failure from engineers- regardless of their quality or ability- to management themselves?","time":1477780735,"title":"Ask HN: Why can't coders code?","type":"story"},{"by":"rosser","descendants":100,"id":12826946,"kids":[12829101,12827039,12827115,12829359,12827153,12827391,12827523,12827202,12827539,12830083,12828846,12828080,12827500,12829329,12829453,12828141,12830380,12828002,12828168,12827123,12829065],"score":342,"time":1477781969,"title":"DMCA exemption for repairs, modifications, research on your vehicle takes effect","type":"story","url":"http://ifixit.org/blog/8510/car-repair-illegal-dmca/"},{"by":"Quanttek","descendants":7,"id":12826739,"kids":[12826982,12827804,12827816],"score":12,"time":1477779428,"title":"Casual Sexism Fridays","type":"story","url":"https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/casual-sexism-fridays"},{"by":"forgottenacc57","descendants":9,"id":12826626,"kids":[12826649,12828377,12854489,12834397,12827103],"score":4,"text":"I can only find one or two good ones on iTunes U.

nearly ten years, my entire computing environment has been a MBP with a Linux VM. OSX was an excellent end user (non dev) environment (music, photos, video), Linux is my preferred dev environment, and VMWare simplified wireless networking compared to some Linux&#x2F;raw metal systems.<p>Then, over ten years, OSX has steadily degraded. Some of the UI decisions were just terrible, e.g. the skeuomorphic Calendar app (RIP). iTunes has long been a mess. iPhoto and Photos have been completely inscrutable to me for a long time.<p>By adding the cloud to things, Apple tried to maintain the fiction that your content is seamlessly anywhere you need it, while safe in the cloud. But there are at least two ids to deal with (I think? Apple ID and something else?). Consuming content on my phone chews up the data permitted by my phone plan. What I would prefer is to manage file locations manually. But the design of the apps makes that difficult. I never know if it is safe to delete anything anywhere, because I don&#x27;t know the rules for propagating the deletion to other devices. It&#x27;s a mess.<p>And now, the absolutely terrible changes for the new MBP. Getting rid of the ESC and Fn keys, and what appears to be a crappy MB keyboard, instead of the old, far superior MBP keyboard. And the non-upgradability of components has really gone too far.<p>I have the last gen MBP before the current one, and hope it lasts a long time.

I&#x27;m interested in high-end version (16gb and UltraSharp screen). Is it worth this money (less than Macbook, but still)? I actually want to buy &quot;best machine money can buy&quot;, which is powerful (for JVM development, besides personal stuff like movies and web), but still easy to carry-on while traveling.

As an audio&#x2F;video engineer and more recently as a front-end developer, I&#x27;ve always been a three operating system guy (Linux for servers, Windows in the living room, and Macs for my daily driver&#x2F;laptop) but recently have found myself using my Linux desktop more and the other platforms less and less.<p>From a practical perspective, going purely open-source would mean trading OSX for Linux, Sublime Text for Atom, Chrome for Firefox, Photoshop for Gimp, etc. All of that sounds totally doable, but the more I think about it, the trickier deciding what should count as &quot;closed-source&quot; gets. My iPhone is certainly closed-source, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s even possible to run AOSP on any of the current batch of Android phones. Replacing my phone with a land line feels like taking too much of a step away from society. Facebook and Twitter are both closed-source platforms I could walk away from easily but again, deciding where to draw the line gets tricky. Avoiding Github and only sharing my code via a self-hosted Gitlab CE instance would seem like obeying the letter of the law but against the spirit of the experiment. Avoiding Google services would probably be the hardest but most interesting transition. (is there anyone offering a truly open-source email service? I know I could self-host, but I imagine I&#x27;d run into problems with messages being caught by spam filters.)<p>So I ask you all: what would going purely open-source mean to you?

Part of that is the environment I&#x27;m in (the undesirable portions of my job are becoming more and more frequent of an event, largely because I&#x27;ve been forced to abandon things I consider basic essentials...like git...because certain people simply refuse to use version control in 2016. I wish I was joking. I&#x27;m not.).<p>One of my friends has noticed in the past ~12 months I&#x27;ve had more and more trouble controlling my temper which is also just not the sort of person I&#x27;d like to be.<p>It is also possible I&#x27;m overreacting to my lack of motivation, the trouble I&#x27;ve been having maintaining a stable sleep schedule, and being forced to deal with stuff about my job I loathe more frequently.<p>I could simply tough it out, continue to have shit productivity, and probably last another 3-6 months before I burn out completely.<p>Money wouldn&#x27;t be an immediate issue, I&#x27;ve got enough to last me ~18 months without touching retirement accounts so I&#x27;d probably have a decent chance at getting a decent job (honestly, a low stress job making $50k in a LCOL location is all I require which for any kind of software development should be relatively trivial to get [although convincing an employer I would stay given might be impossible with my experience&#x2F;salary history]).<p>Thoughts?","time":1477605560,"title":"How risky is a voluntary 90 day sabbatical

friend took her Vauxhall Corsa for an MOT at the weekend. \nUpon inspection, two of the VIN numbers on the vehicle match the log book, the third does not.

She was also told to inform the police. The police say if she drives the car and gets pulled over there will be questions as to why the cars VIN numbers don&#x27;t match as that is illegal.<p>After numerous phone calls where Vaxhaull wouldn&#x27;t even entertain that this could happen, they eventually agreed to acknowledge the problem and say it will take 6 weeks to correct.<p>My friend is a community nurse and uses the car every day to visit sick people.

I created DreamCoin to help people make money off of their ideas, blogs, or whatever else they can put into writing. You can find it here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dreamco.in<p>I&#x27;m aware that the site confuses people and could be vastly improved upon. That&#x27;s where you come in. I&#x27;m looking for people who&#x27;d like to either join my team or provide contract work to improve the design. I can pay in small amounts, but I cannot offer salary or wages.<p>As an amateur developer &#x2F; designer with no business experience, creating the platform from scratch took a long time and hasn&#x27;t gone very far. Please contact me at hackernews@dreamco.in with any suggestions or help you can offer.<p>Originally, DreamCoin was for individual, anonymous ideas. Users pay the price to view an idea, and if they like it, the price goes up by 1. If they dislike it, the price goes down by 1. So, you&#x27;re paying to view content based on popularity. I now see this as a potential blogging platform where users make money off of quality writing.<p>I&#x27;ve had many people explain to me why this will never work. People don&#x27;t like paying for individual pieces of content. They&#x27;d rather donate via Patreon or a crowd-funded method. Preferably, they&#x27;d pay nothing, and the webmaster would use tracking &#x2F; advertising to make money. That&#x27;s fine. I believe people will pay for content if the platform is set up correctly and doesn&#x27;t violate user privacy. Amazon requires you to purchase a book before you can read it.

Here&#x27;s some added context:<p>- We&#x27;re bootstraped;<p>- We don&#x27;t pay rent;<p>- We don&#x27;t have employees beside the founders;<p>- We have only two technical people (me +1);<p>- We have two clients so far;<p>Thanks a lot in advance.<p>[0] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;avg.html","time":1476714843,"title":"Ask HN: Integrating early-days startup with giant CRMs – like

Searching for &quot;solo developer&quot; or similar brings up a long list of articles about why working on your own is problematic, a few talking about historical solo projects (while pointing out that &quot;we don&#x27;t do stuff like this any more&quot;) and basically nothing in defence of the solo programmer.  About the closest I can find to such a defence comes -- a little surprisingly -- from the XP people [1].  This is counter-intuitive to me: tooling has <i>generally</i> improved since the 80s (with a few reservations) and the range of libraries available has increased massively.  So a solo programmer has extra leverage and <i>ought</i> to be able to achieve more today, not less.<p>I suspect there&#x27;s a degree of ascertainment bias here due to plenty of successful solo programmers churning out useful code but not feeling too much urge to write about it.  But really, it does seem like there has been a change over the past decade or so, and very few people are willing to speak out for the solo coder.<p>Can anyone think of any exception?<p>[1] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20160709203742&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;c2.com&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;wiki?TeamOfOne","time":1476627851,"title":"Ask HN: Whatever became of the solo programmer?","type":"story"},{"by":"disows","descendants":3,"id":12718681,"kids":[12718874,12720201],"score":3,"text":"I started a website that shows a list of 100 curated, good and brandable domain names (I only have my own 6 featured there so far...) and I&#x27;m wondering if anyone is sitting on a few domain names they would like to sell for the right price.<p>There are no fees whatsoever (although you are encouraged to tip me if you have a successful sell) and no need for ownership verifications and all that stuff.

If you are using windows 10 and would like to open windows apps from the ubuntu bash shell normally you can&#x27;t do that. I wrote this app to (sorta) let you do that.

Next is a shell script that you put in your path on the ubuntu shell.<p>It&#x27;s called Rockhopper (named after a species of penguin, since you are hopping form Linux to windows with this app is just seemed like the right name :) ), and you invoke it like this:<p>rockhopper -c code -a C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\shawn\\\\\\\\Documents\\\\\\\\file_to_edit.txt<p>That opens Visual Studio Code from windows with that file passed in. Couple of caveats, the windows app has to be launchable via the windows cmd prompt, currently only supports 1 argument to open and the pathing is touchy, and lastly this has absolutely 0 security built in.

However, the library (let&#x27;s call it &quot;ArduinoLib&quot;) can be compiled for desktop PCs, and I am among a few people using it this way.<p>To fix these limitations, I would like to write an alternative library for use on desktops. This would be a separate open-source project, using a different name. However, ArduinoLib is MIT-licensed, so there is the option to re-use some of its code.<p>Perhaps 1&#x2F;3 of ArduinoLib&#x27;s code could be used unchanged. Another 1&#x2F;3 would require major changes to add my desktop-focused enhancements. The final 1&#x2F;3 is microcontroller-focused and would not be useful for a desktop library.<p>I see several possible ways to approach this project, some starting with the existing ArduinoLib and some starting afresh:<p><i>1.1</i>. Fork ArduinoLib on GitHub, remove the microcontroller-focused code, then add my enhancements to this fork.<p><i>1.2</i>. As above, but instead of a true fork, create a new repository and begin by importing the latest version of ArduinoLib.<p><i>2.1</i>. Start my library from scratch, importing individual functions and&#x2F;or files from ArduinoLib where appropriate.<p><i>2.2</i>. Write the entire alternative library myself, only using ArduinoLib for reference.<p>The argument in favour of the <i>1.x</i> options is that they will lead to a project structure which is similar to ArduinoLib, whereas <i>2.x</i> will result in more differences between the projects. Such similarities should make it easier to share code between ArduinoLib and my library, which would be beneficial for both projects.<p>On the other hand, with the <i>2.x</i> options my library can start from a clean slate. I would be able to make my enhancements without any &quot;baggage&quot; from the unused microcontroller support getting in the way.<p>Which of these four approaches would you recommend taking?

Right now if you want to hire you either go through your referral network (good method for first couple employees), hire a recruiter (very expensive), or founder&#x2F;HR does recruiting.<p>I always believe that companies should exhaust their personal network before hiring a third-party recruiter or internal recruiter. The founder can also personally recruit, but he doesn&#x27;t have a lot of time especially to go through and add people on LinkedIn or Github. Recruiters typically cost 20% of first year salary and internal recruiters should be focused on building relationships with potential employees. They aren&#x27;t dedicated sourcers.<p>That is where we come in. A company will tell us they are looking for a python developer with 3-5 years experience in Austin, Texas. They will pay $250 for a 100 name Excel Spreadsheet that comes with names, email address, current company, title, social profiles and (cost extra) rating.<p>This will save companies a lot of time by doing something they really aren&#x27;t experts in and is much cheaper than hiring a full-service recruiter. Many large companies don&#x27;t even have dedicated sourcing teams so I see this as something that can be used at a two person startup to a Fortune 500 company.<p>What are your thoughts?

My objective is to get ideas about the best way to represent this data for quick analysis.","time":1476033921,"title":"Ask HN: Any good examples for dashboard for performance analysis","type":"story"},{"by":"Darphe","descendants":21,"id":12672144,"kids":[12672294,12672621,12672625,12680502],"score":30,"time":1476033547,"title":"How the Casio F-91W became the world’s most versatile (and dangerous) watch","type":"story","url":"http://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/10/20/how-the-casio-f-91w-became-the-worlds-most-versatile-and-dangerous-watch/"},{"by":"akos","descendants":99,"id":12672061,"kids":[12672603,12672891,12672445,12672100,12672242,12673043,12672258,12672209,12672554,12672340,12672591,12672342,12672923,12679012,12673282,12672278,12672627,12673311,12683062,12672298,12672407,12672765,12672937,12672440,12672254,12674803,12672607,12672535,12677471,12672121,12674245,12672536,12673191,12674462,12672380,12726784,12672099],"score":92,"text":"I am done with the coding and I would like to shoot my site into the wild and start some marketing.

Usually the second interview is over the phone and is 95% coding challenges and if you don&#x27;t happen to do well then too bad, you&#x27;re out. On the other hand I&#x27;ve never once been asked about references. I also have numerous open source projects with high quality code and actual products with actual users. Only a tiny fraction of places actually look at any of it but all definitely care more about their contrived coding challenges than anything I&#x27;ve actually done or experience I have. Even worse are the cases where the company asks you to do a long coding problem on your own without compensation on top of all the coding challenges. Is it really better to have a company made up of people who are good at solving puzzles in front of people rather than people that have proven they can do a good job?

I was hoping perhaps someone here might have some advise?<p>So I&#x27;m on the austism spectrum. It&#x27;s not severe, but bad enough that I often don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s funny and what isn&#x27;t. I cant make small talk. And I find it generally hard to form relationships even when I try.<p>I also suffer from depression. I think about killing myself a lot. People hate depressed people. And I get it. I try to pretend I&#x27;m happy, but some days I can&#x27;t and that pushes people away.<p>Being a solitary kid also caused me to develop an extreme shyness. It&#x27;s better these days but I still have noticeable anxiety in social situations, and I tend to avoid them whenever I can. That makes it even harder for me to form relationships.<p>I was recently let go from my job and I&#x27;m certain part of that was due to me never really fitting in. And again, I understand why people wouldn&#x27;t want someone like me around. I&#x27;m a terrible team player, I&#x27;m weird and unsociable, and when I do have to communicate I&#x27;m crippled by shyness.<p>I&#x27;ve spent my whole life trying and failing to start my own thing so I can get away from people. But it&#x27;s never worked out, probably in part because I stuck at making the kinds of contacts I should be.<p>But I need to get a job soon because I&#x27;m going to be homeless in a few of weeks. I know if I apply to enough places someone will over look my awkwardness during the interview and give me job. But I&#x27;ll never get promoted because I&#x27;m the weird guy in the corner. And one day the markets will change and I&#x27;l naturally be first in line to be let go.<p>I&#x27;m getting fed up with it honestly. I&#x27;ve always been bright, but that&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t mean much.<p>Is anyone in a similar position?

I feel like my mind has got progressively less capable in the last say, five years.  I can&#x27;t work out whether this is a perception thing, or associated with my health, or something to do with my working environment or lifestyle.<p>I was just posting this to see if anyone had similar experiences or advice to help me work out why.<p>Typically I have an hour in the gym in the morning doing cardio.  I start work at 9am, and typically finish at 7pm.  It seems right now I have lost all my rigour.  I find myself in a codebase trying to work something out for an hour where it feels like it should be a simple thing I should be able to grasp in five minutes.  I constantly have to flip back and forth to remember things.  Five years ago I was TDD all the way.  Now I find myself writing no tests, fiddling with my code because I don&#x27;t feel I can work out how any outcome is reached so I tweak, deploying, retry.  It all feels very inefficient and stupid.  At the moment I&#x27;ve got about 10 different projects on at the same time at work, and I typically switch projects when interrupted by others, it isn&#x27;t possible to plan.  I try to keep a task list but it soon ends up with 30 red items on it, and there&#x27;s so many tasks I&#x27;ve forgotten them..  However I&#x27;m a lot slower than I used to be.  I lack motivation unless I have a bit of modafinil, but that doesn&#x27;t really push the needle anymore and I&#x27;d have to have 100mg or more to really increase my speed, and that makes me even more scatterbrained in the evenings.  I am trying to write my own SAAS in spare time which goes a bit technically better but there&#x27;s still not much pride or rigour.<p>If I compare this to 5 years ago, my mind would be clearer, I&#x27;d be unleashed upon a codebase and could understand it quickly.  I&#x27;d build tests and have pride in what I&#x27;m doing.  I&#x27;d have a plan for systems.  I&#x27;d be able to build pictures of systems in my head.

I present to you my business as a means of accomplishing this for you. Utilize my established brand&#x27;s customer base to get better ROI over banner and search engine ads.<p>So, I have a <i>decade old</i> brand that includes a website and C++ based desktop products for the Microsoft Windows environment. Customers include recognizable brands (Airbus, John Deere, etc.), government agencies, universities, small law offices, small businesses, and soccer moms.<p>Business and non-commercial entities buy my products to slightly augment the Windows desktop experience.<p>You will get full control of the domain, the source code, and all customer contacts. You get everything. The brand runs itself with me intervening for custom programming and pre-sales help with larger orders.<p>Don&#x27;t buy it for the yearly revenue which is low and uninteresting. You want this for the SEO, customer base, and product downloads. Utilize the domain or products to push your message.<p>Why?\nIt look a long time, but I finally realized I am actually a Product Manager and not any of the other things it takes to run a business. You are a person that knows how to run a business. My skillset is understanding the product experience and placement, client services, etc. Take what I&#x27;ve done and use it to better itself or your brand&#x27;s message.<p>Contacting me:\nMy throw away email account is in my profile. After you contact me, I&#x27;ll communicate with you over a business account. Respectfully, I ask you to not contact me unless you have the resources for something like this. I know this post raises curiosity, but you&#x27;ll be wasting time for both of us if you&#x27;re not truly a buyer.<p>Thank you for your interest. I&#x27;d be happy to discuss, in the comment section, the general idea being presented here (but not any specifics about the company being offered).","time":1475593228,"title":"Ask HN: A better way to

Though I began learning and developing software at the age of 13 (I&#x27;m 22 now).<p>My main expertise is web development (front-end and back-end), and I was involved in many non-web related back-ends (like mobile &amp; desktop back-ends).<p>I recently started looking for a job in my home country (Israel), and I&#x27;ve been interviewed by two companies so far. The first picked someone else, the second offered me what I consider a generous salary (~20% above fresh CS grad avg, and I don&#x27;t have a CS degree) and an interesting field to work in (deep learning, in which I have zero experience, but they believe I&#x27;m fit for it after testing me).<p>So this is my first job offer in the field ever, and I was pretty excited at first. The only problem I have is the distance - about a hour and 45 minutes each direction. With a 9 hour workday and 3 hours and 30 minutes of being on the road, I&#x27;d be very exhausted every evening which would mean I wouldn&#x27;t be programming in the little spare time I&#x27;d have left. I&#x27;d be too exhausted to do any side projects or develop new skills which I love to do very much. This free time I always had in the evenings is what led me to this field in the first place.<p>I&#x27;m not hurrying to take a job, I can support myself via freelancing until I find one. I believe I&#x27;ll find a job that is much shorter on travel time if I keep looking, but it might be not as interesting as deep learning to me though.<p>So what do you guys think? As someone who isn&#x27;t in a hurry to find a job and loves his after-work free time, would you give up your free time for an interesting job or would you keep looking for an interesting job that allows you to keep your free time?","time":1475510777,"title":"Ask HN: Should I take this job or keep

I also have a good programming background so just some sort of practical examples would be nice.<p>Any help would be appreciated.","time":1475442074,"title":"Ask HN: Looking for pen-testing training material","type":"story"},{"by":"GirlsCanCode","dead":true,"id":12624167,"kids":[12624636,12624603],"score":19,"time":1475441381,"title":"Pieter Hintjens has died","type":"story","url":"https://twitter.com/snicoll/status/782659304138637313"},{"by":"lisper","descendants":10,"id":12624136,"kids":[12628741,12628625,12628588,12630774,12632345],"score":29,"time":1475440934,"title":"The Inevitability of Physical Laws: Why the Higgs Has to Exist (2012) [video]","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOEoffh6WTs"},{"by":"benbreen","descendants":7,"id":12624300,"kids":[12632494,12629830,12632148,12630630],"score":19,"time":1475443102,"title":"The Lotus Eaters (2013)","type":"story","url":"http://mikejay.net/the-lotus-eaters/"},{"by":"vtorosyan","descendants":356,"id":12624112,"kids":[12624364,12624291,12624246,12624444,12624847,12624465,12624226,12625155,12627674,12629110,12626318,12627156,12624648,12624585,12625235,12624253,12624542,12624476,12625238,12624238,12626342,12626831,12628831,12624276,12624304,12625147,12624682,12624141,12624579,12624567,12624625,12624688,12625024,12661260,12625300,12626028,12625348,12624631,12625798,12624904,12624572,12624420,12625202,12627677,12624959,12624731,12624719,12625411,12624668,12625161,12624343,12625391,12624618,12626384,12625080,12625243,12624975,12628309,12625913],"score":417,"time":1475440674,"title":"Never accept a counter-offer","type":"story","url":"https://vtorosyan.github.io/never-accept-counter-offer/"},{"by":"dnetesn","descendants":2,"id":12624073,"kids":[12624464,12625335],"score":35,"time":1475440217,"title":"The Sweet Emotional Life of Bees","type":"story","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/30/science/bees-emotion-sugar.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fscience&action=click&contentCollection=science&region=rank&module=package&version=highlights&contentPlacement=2&pgtype=sectionfront"},{"by":"wrongc0ntinent","descendants":19,"id":12624022,"kids":[12626077,12625001,12625657,12625076,12624902,12625700,12625502,12625028,12625494,12625327],"score":160,"time":1475439449,"title":"Our Part of the Milky Way Is Bigger Than Previously Thought","type":"story","url":"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/09/milky-way-local-arm-four-times-bigger-than-expected/"},{"by":"Hooke","descendants":18,"id":12624036,"kids":[12624609,12624302,12625581,12626848],"score":50,"time":1475439702,"title":"What is chemical intuition?","type":"story","url":"http://wavefunction.fieldofscience.com/2016/09/what-is-chemical-intuition.html"},{"by":"fspacef","descendants":101,"id":12623866,"kids":[12625933,12624393,12624064,12623939,12625727,12624434,12624239,12624127,12624106,12624727,12626745,12624848,12624581,12625709,12625217,12624084,12680604,12624308,12625458,12626250,12625666,12626259,12624265,12623950,12624385,12624213,12625133,12625034,12625413,12627814,12625036,12626372,12625499,12626194,12624115,12624219,12624509,12624543,12625050,12625407,12624320,12660170,12633106,12624960,12625134],"score":179,"time":1475437161,"title":"Karabiner – Easy Keyboard Remapping for OS X","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner"},{"by":"LyalinDotCom","descendants":88,"id":12623780,"kids":[12624255,12624170,12624387,12624386,12624154,12624178,12624076,12625777,12626049,12627738],"score":142,"time":1475435928,"title":"Putting my VB6 Windows Apps in the Windows 10 Store","type":"story","url":"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PuttingMyVB6WindowsAppsInTheWindows10StoreProjectCentennial.aspx"},{"by":"jvermillard","descendants":51,"id":12623738,"kids":[12624203,12624523,12624113,12624169,12623942,12624800,12623960,12624819,12628696,12624093,12625041,12626008,12623947,12630015,12625382,12624467],"score":199,"time":1475435268,"title":"The Art of Making a Nixie Tube [video]","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxL4ElboiuA"},{"by":"btym","descendants":6,"id":12623752,"kids":[12624070,12623818,12623792],"score":16,"time":1475435535,"title":"Images Generated by Layers of Yahoo's “Open NSFW” DNN Model","type":"story","url":"https://twitter.com/mr_hogeland/status/782657444828753920"},{"by":"chaghalibaghali","descendants":27,"id":12623508,"kids":[12623820,12624263,12625357,12623756,12624736,12627255,12624012,12624008,12634250],"score":117,"time":1475431751,"title":"“I just want to run a container”","type":"story","url":"http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/10/02/i-just-want-to-run-a-container/"},{"by":"euro_asker","descendants":3,"id":12623402,"kids":[12623903,12623475],"score":5,"text":"A lot of threads here are (for natural reasons) very US focused so I thought why not make a european salary thread?

still in beta.. or alpha-ish) thats follows the craigslist philosophy but focuses on freelancers.<p>Now the current situation is that I&#x27;m not able to get freelancelist.in off the ground!\nI&#x27;m good at building products with a team but have no experience with branding or promotions.<p>The projects I work on as a freelancer usually have an active audience or a good brand value hence, I have no idea about launching this off the ground.<p>What do you think should be the next step ?\nWhile you&#x27;re at it, please leave a feedback too :)\nThank you!","time":1475414178,"title":"Ask HN: How do you get people to use your product when you suck at networking?","type":"story"},{"by":"zerognowl","descendants":2,"id":12622128,"kids":[12622224,12622153],"score":4,"time":1475413466,"title":"CAcert – A community-driven Certificate Authority","type":"story","url":"http://www.cacert.org/"},{"by":"mynameislegion","descendants":2,"id":12622094,"kids":[12623080,12622146],"score":3,"time":1475412625,"title":"Gittup: an entire(-ish) linux distribution in git","type":"story","url":"http://gittup.org/gittup/"},{"by":"mynameislegion","descendants":99,"id":12622097,"kids":[12622998,12623411,12622581,12622310,12622790,12624615,12622540,12622742,12623619,12623268,12622922,12623670,12622410,12623834,12622424,12622159,12624007,12623338,12623007,12624555,12624623,12622260,12622133,12622671,12622743,12623777],"score":169,"time":1475412653,"title":"Tup – A file-based build system for Linux, OS X, and Windows","type":"story","url":"http://gittup.org/tup/"},{"by":"detaro","descendants":8,"id":12621971,"kids":[12622266,12622243,12622155],"score":47,"time":1475409542,"title":"Creative Commons licences under scrutiny: What does “noncommercial” mean?","type":"story","url":"http://arstechnica.co.uk/tech-policy/2016/09/creative-commons-licences-nocommercial/"},{"by":"snowy","descendants":2,"id":12621962,"kids":[12621981,12622007],"score":5,"time":1475409358,"title":"Body cameras sees complaints against police ‘virtually vanish’, study finds","type":"story","url":"https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/use-of-body-worn-cameras-sees-complaints-against-police-virtually-vanish-study-finds"},{"by":"okket","descendants":84,"id":12621950,"kids":[12622809,12622149,12622148,12622127,12624424,12621959,12624380,12623649,12623629,12624041,12623628],"score":166,"time":1475409124,"title":"Postgres full-text search is Good Enough (2015)","type":"story","url":"http://rachbelaid.com/postgres-full-text-search-is-good-enough/"},{"by":"sashk","descendants":2,"id":12621956,"kids":[12621972,12621976],"score":2,"time":1475409279,"title":"Apple: Blocking Trust for WoSign CA Free SSL Certificate G2","type":"story","url":"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202858"},{"by":"infodroid","descendants":191,"id":12621909,"kids":[12622421,12622327,12622439,12622282,12622252,12622355,12622349,12622511,12622507,12622258,12622464],"score":110,"time":1475408212,"title":"When world leaders thought you shouldn't need passports or visas","type":"story","url":"http://theconversation.com/when-world-leaders-thought-you-shouldnt-need-passports-or-visas-64847"},{"by":"livatlantis","descendants":25,"id":12621921,"kids":[12622115,12624342,12622132,12622087,12622572,12622123],"score":27,"time":1475408456,"title":"Audio Reveals What John Kerry Told Syrians Behind Closed Doors","type":"story","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/09/30/world/middleeast/john-kerry-syria-audio.html"},{"by":"roman01la","descendants":6,"id":12621899,"kids":[12621951,12622340,12622211,12622775],"score":3,"time":1475407898,"title":"From JavaScript to ClojureScript: Which Editor to Choose?","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@roman01la/from-javascript-to-clojurescript-which-editor-to-choose-a444b2f8edca#.8vymyhomn"},{"by":"antfarm","descendants":372,"id":12621837,"kids":[12622746,12622508,12623989,12622203,12621955,12621908,12622383,12624783,12627444,12623148,12622798,12622561,12622091,12622705,12622196,12622254,12621938,12621940,12623034,12621979,12621924,12623948,12625615,12622205,12622116,12622553,12622429,12623688,12624624,12623362,12625819,12622857,12624229,12622682,12627164,12624649,12625138,12621986,12622773,12625705,12622494],"score":516,"time":1475406547,"title":"Gitless: a version control system","type":"story","url":"http://gitless.com/"},{"by":"sarreph","descendants":6,"id":12621757,"kids":[12626304,12622170,12622052,12632953,12621813,12622665],"score":9,"text":"A friend and I have produced the media &#x2F;

I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s something which only happens in here, but people seems to always assume that apps are free.","time":1475110804,"title":"Ask HN: How would you tell that your app is going to require a subscription?","type":"story"},{"by":"prostoalex","descendants":257,"id":12601956,"kids":[12602296,12602863,12602334,12602724,12604338,12603127,12603832,12602678,12604399,12603539,12602278,12602331,12603962,12605560,12603253,12604367,12605160,12602246,12602298,12602323,12604108,12602478,12602465,12603694,12602662],"score":351,"time":1475102641,"title":"The Effect of State Marijuana Legalizations","type":"story","url":"http://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/dose-reality-effect-state-marijuana-legalizations"},{"by":"Thevet","descendants":11,"id":12601761,"kids":[12610422,12609593],"score":23,"time":1475100714,"title":"Plotting the Geocoordinates You May Have Accidentally Left Behind in Photos","type":"story","url":"http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/this-map-plots-the-geocoordinates-you-may-have-accidentally-left-behind-in-digital-photos"},{"by":"askafriend","descendants":42,"id":12601751,"kids":[12602110,12601885,12602477,12602396,12602196,12602182,12602295,12601979,12602350,12602285,12602403,12602370,12602394,12602282,12602365,12602652,12602304,12602397,12602419,12602191,12602095],"score":36,"time":1475100619,"title":"Pair Programming: give it a rest (2013)","type":"story","url":"https://peniwize.wordpress.com/2013/11/17/pair-programming-give-it-a-rest/"},{"by":"fraqed","descendants":53,"id":12601678,"kids":[12607769,12605740,12607115,12601970,12605631,12605912,12608696,12606811,12606558],"score":116,"time":1475099902,"title":"Can a molecule that makes mice smarter heal a human brain?","type":"story","url":"https://www.statnews.com/2016/09/28/memory-isrib-peter-walter/"},{"by":"arturgrigor","descendants":121,"id":12601622,"kids":[12602127,12603878,12601967,12602119,12602042,12602908,12604017,12604070,12604875,12604283,12604422,12602472,12602109,12603182,12601894,12603615,12602307],"score":146,"time":1475099336,"title":"Search Ads","type":"story","url":"https://searchads.apple.com"},{"by":"vonnik","descendants":36,"id":12601510,"kids":[12602551,12602074,12610852],"score":85,"time":1475098096,"title":"Deep learning startup Skymind (YC W16) raises $3M, launches enterprise AI distro","type":"story","url":"http://venturebeat.com/2016/09/28/deep-learning-startup-skymind-raises-3-million-launches-intelligence-layer-distribution/"},{"by":"rosiesherry","descendants":59,"id":12601609,"kids":[12603666,12602776,12601971,12603237,12603557,12604693,12602106,12603751,12602651,12616058,12603675,12603635,12603773,12604670,12610504,12603060,12602542],"score":314,"time":1475099198,"title":"Building an $80k/month business with a software testing community","type":"story","url":"https://www.indiehackers.com/businesses/ministry-of-testing"},{"by":"Vekz","descendants":3,"id":12601492,"kids":[12603965,12610662,12608724],"score":5,"text":"I want to set something up where I can write on pen and paper and convert it to a text file.

Unfortunately, it happens more often than not here in Silicon Valley.<p>On the brighter side, four years later - I learned a lot.

My other founder is an American, so he speaks with perfect English. (And not perfect Russian!)<p>In my opinion, he should talk for maybe all the video. I can say hello and give my introduction, but he should explain the startup, and all technical details.<p>He says my accent is not annoying, and I should also talk, because of specific domain expertise of banking.

I took no offense! It is 100% logical. In each case, the accent interferes with communication. It is not racism.

For example, voice control is clearly going to be a primary way we interact with our gadgets in the future.

I have had interest shown, but nothing concrete yet.<p>Thank you for any feedback.","time":1474573241,"title":"Ask HN: How to get contributions to open source project","type":"story"},{"by":"bassmaster","descendants":19,"id":12559828,"kids":[12565847,12562458,12560584,12560187,12563079,12560641,12560165,12563003,12570910,12560111,12573775,12560198],"score":7,"text":"In short: I&#x27;ve recently started a small game studio and I was considering bringing in an artist as an employee.<p>Now, we&#x27;re still a little way off getting any real money in (consulting is the majority right now), so I have worked out I can afford to pay not really more than around £20-25k&#x2F;pa.

I&#x27;m curious in particular about the open source piece (I know that getting traction with an app is not easy but that&#x27;s a separate discussion). What if we release the app and it takes off, but then some folks decide they don&#x27;t want to pay and they set up their own instance?<p>I understand that there are real costs involved in supporting and maintaining a web app. But support and maintenance are different than funding new feature development, and this is what I&#x27;m curious about. Feature dev costs a lot of money. We are not interested in rent-seeking (earning more than the cost of the services we provide plus a modest profit), but we don&#x27;t want to get undercut and lose our shirt either.<p>Let&#x27;s say it legitimately costs $1k&#x2F;month to just keep the app running and answer customer questions. Then let&#x27;s say we need to spend $5k&#x2F;month on feature dev. If we charge our users enough to cover the $1k + $5k + a modest profit, what&#x27;s to stop someone else from setting up their own instance (open source!), charging just enough to cover the $1k in support costs, and simply slurping up every new release our people push to master?<p>Is this why folks like GitLab are &quot;open core&quot;, but keep certain feature sets proprietary?<p>How do folks like Discourse, who are totally open source, make it work? In fact I see that there is discoursehosting.com which sells instances starting at $20&#x2F;mo while Discourse themselves charge $100&#x2F;mo. Why does anyone pay the $100?

The team is new (but experienced) so there was some learning &#x2F; setup overhead but it&#x27;s now fairly minimal. We use Clubhouse so we have some insights into our velocity.<p>Now, base on our realistic projection we need at least 17 days before we can deliver our initial Epics. However, management could no longer wait and they have set an arbitrary deadline by the end of month. They are now asking us to work through the weekend at a remote location so we could be undistracted to deliver the work. Management thinks that the 3 days away undistracted will yield twice the productivity so the math ends up somewhat working (2 work weeks plus weekend = 12 plus 3 days with 2x output = 15 days).<p>I&#x27;m not entirely convinced that this is possible but management believes so. My biggest concern is that the team will not deliver twice the productivity over the weekend for 3 days and still keep up with normal productivity the week after. I&#x27;m wondering if other HN members have similar stories to share (both success and failure) and if there&#x27;s any recommendation I can make to management.","time":1474459223,"title":"Ask HN: Best way to crunch 3 weeks work into 2?","type":"story"},{"by":"stevekemp","descendants":262,"id":12547353,"kids":[12549368,12547359,12547964,12548796,12548449,12548584,12548023,12548158,12549102,12550332,12548929,12551377,12552819,12548180,12548501,12549121,12548520,12548155,12549861,12548232,12551266,12548204,12550844,12550830,12552213,12547955,12548607,12550494,12548068,12548930,12548450,12548221,12549810],"score":354,"time":1474459249,"title":"Why Finnish babies sleep in cardboard boxes (2013)","type":"story","url":"http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22751415"},{"by":"apatters","dead":true,"id":12547202,"kids":[12547443,12547404],"score":5,"time":1474457776,"title":"Theranos' unbelievably cold reaction to the suicide of its chief scientist","type":"story","url":"http://www.seattlepi.com/technology/businessinsider/article/5-books-that-inspired-billionaire-CEO-Elizabeth-6367276.php"},{"by":"jpatokal","descendants":155,"id":12547181,"kids":[12548944,12548522,12547882,12547820,12547927,12547922,12548339,12547870,12547912,12547942,12548309,12548086,12549108,12548814,12549270,12549464,12549493,12549391,12548521,12548390],"score":383,"time":1474457589,"title":"Police Accidentally Record Themselves Conspiring to Fabricate Charges","type":"story","url":"https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-future/police-accidentally-record-themselves-conspiring-fabricate-criminal-charges-against"},{"by":"alexeidos","dead":true,"id":12547140,"kids":[12578950,12549401,12549394,12549155,12549172,12549314,12549303,12549171,12548650,12549175,12549060],"score":116,"time":1474457107,"title":"Growth Hacking Case Study – 92,600 Visitors in 7 Days Riding the Pokemon Go Wave","type":"story","url":"http://rainmakers.io/growth-hacking/growth-hacking-case-study-pokemon-go/?ref=hackernews"},{"by":"Aissen","descendants":128,"id":12547130,"kids":[12547350,12548146,12547634,12547507,12547599,12547711,12547841,12548672,12549403,12547750,12549656,12549413],"score":219,"time":1474456997,"title":"Google backs off on previously announced Allo privacy feature","type":"story","url":"http://www.theverge.com/2016/9/21/12994362/allo-privacy-message-logs-google"},{"by":"solarengineer","descendants":14,"id":12547057,"kids":[12555272,12550777,12551568,12554099,12550423,12551360],"score":28,"time":1474456130,"title":"WhatsApp puts advertisers first, users second – time to switch to Signal","type":"story","url":"https://hackforprivacy.org/post/whatsapp.html"},{"by":"selmat","descendants":99,"id":12546802,"kids":[12547018,12547285,12547449,12547547,12547667,12548794,12547039,12546878,12547068,12547317,12547095,12550029,12547030,12548981,12548639,12548822,12547631,12550920,12548421,12547235,12546824,12547010,12547038,12547132,12547448,12547268,12547426,12547053],"score":118,"time":1474452596,"title":"Will Coke Dissolve a Nail?

am in a tricky situation and hoping someone here can provide some guidance. Also figured the answers might help someone who has a similar situation.<p>I am a sr dev with ~8 yrs of experience currently working in one of the top financial tech companies in nyc for ~5 years. I work in a good team and clear a little more than 150K&#x2F;yr, but I recently got to know that my total compensation is quite low (~50K) compared to others in the same grade that doesn’t sit with me well.<p>My responsibilities have been growing, but I feel I don’t see the same growth in the salary. I’ve thought about asking my lead&#x2F;managers about the difference, but I know it would backfire since I know the managers well and they would just say I have to work really hard to close the gap. I also believe that this gap will never close since the review is dependent on previous reviews and impressions. (Long story, my first reviews took a wrong turn due to bad managers and it took me years to get it above the average).<p>My dilemma is should I work hard in the current company trusting them to right the wrongs knowing its unlikely, or should I find a new job and invest the effort there outright. Also, I know the I will get a increase of ~50-75K or higher total comp if I jump ship to a good company (think Big 4) with similar benefits, but I am worried about losing some perks (flexible working hours &amp; ~7hrs&#x2F;day, work from home ~20d&#x2F;yr, hike rate of ~7% etc). Being in my prime years(early 30s now), I feel I should make as much money I can before I become the older person in the group. Lastly, I am on a work visa so thinking about the risk of landing in a bad team&#x2F;company only to change again.<p>Appreciate the opinions.<p>New user here so let me know if I made any mistakes in posting or if I missed anything important.<p>TL&#x2F;DR: Good position at good company with ~30% less pay than others, settle for less money for comfort&#x2F;perks&#x2F;culture or jump ship for maximum value in prime years.","time":1474425370,"title":"Ask HN: Settle for less salary or change to make more in prime years","type":"story"},{"by":"ValG","descendants":9,"id":12544995,"kids":[12546410,12545293,12545999,12545699],"score":11,"time":1474425071,"title":"Microsoft will 'solve' cancer within 10 years by 'reprogramming' diseased cells","type":"story","url":"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/09/20/microsoft-will-solve-cancer-within-10-years-by-reprogramming-dis/"},{"by":"Halienja","descendants":20,"id":12544987,"kids":[12545486,12546704,12545165,12546156,12545174],"score":76,"time":1474424954,"title":"RoslynLinqRewrite – Compiles C# by rewriting and optimising LINQ expressions","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/antiufo/roslyn-linq-rewrite"},{"by":"raldu","descendants":383,"id":12544881,"kids":[12548993,12545779,12547881,12545837,12545286,12545115,12545210,12545575,12545514,12545272,12547985,12545118,12545354,12545833,12545343,12546917,12553460,12545306,12545356,12546931,12545362,12545623,12546510,12548568,12545801,12545643,12545365,12545524,12545715,12545523,12545377,12555731,12548620,12548651,12546977,12546190,12548858,12548725,12545321,12549152,12545559,12545707,12545345,12545540,12545774,12545156],"score":413,"time":1474422906,"title":"Nootropics","type":"story","url":"https://www.gwern.net/Nootropics"},{"by":"Vigier","descendants":112,"id":12544770,"kids":[12558931,12558951,12560566,12560787,12559065,12559240,12560545,12562844,12562926,12558888,12560420,12559498,12559977,12559651],"score":111,"time":1474421063,"title":"The Building Blocks of Japanese Cuisine","type":"story","url":"http://luckypeach.com/guides/building-blocks-japanese-cuisine/"},{"by":"Thevet","descendants":5,"id":12544587,"kids":[12561371,12560817,12561305,12560882],"score":10,"time":1474418723,"title":"The Trouble with Sombreros","type":"story","url":"http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2016/09/19/the-trouble-with-sombreros-shriver-cultural-appropriation/"},{"by":"graffitici","descendants":4,"id":12544577,"kids":[12544938,12544582],"score":5,"time":1474418648,"title":"Evernote is moving to the Google Cloud Platform","type":"story","url":"https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2016/09/13/evernotes-future-cloud/"},{"by":"bootload","descendants":2,"id":12544575,"kids":[12544635,12544583],"score":3,"time":1474418643,"title":"The Rise of MOS Technology and the 6502 (2003)","type":"story","url":"http://www.commodore.ca/commodore-history/the-rise-of-mos-technology-the-6502/"},{"by":"nstj","descendants":2,"id":12544551,"kids":[12545218,12545019],"score":16,"time":1474418436,"title":"Apple owns the world's largest hedge fund","type":"story","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braeburn_Capital"},{"by":"barry-cotter","descendants":84,"id":12544419,"kids":[12544593,12544628,12544654,12544718,12544589,12544519,12544821,12544649,12544687,12544679,12544640,12544619,12544522,12544554,12544612,12544731,12544917,12545213,12544699,12544753,12544719,12544520,12544523,12544806],"score":61,"time":1474416380,"title":"Sorry, Chicago but Peter Thiel Is Mostly Right","type":"story","url":"http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20160919/OPINION/160919839/peter-thiel-comments-on-chicago-are-on-the-mark-aaron-renn?X-IgnoreUserAgent=1"},{"by":"mattkahl","descendants":49,"id":12544284,"kids":[12544374,12544434,12544898,12544404,12544766,12545191,12544366,12545113,12544904,12544876,12544553,12548464,12544961,12544885],"score":109,"time":1474414765,"title":"Browser History (2013)","type":"story","url":"https://madhatted.com/2013/6/16/you-do-not-understand-browser-history"},{"by":"kiloreux","descendants":3,"id":12544191,"kids":[12544448,12544238,12544231],"score":1,"text":"Let&#x27;s say I want to build something that is better than HN, what do I need ?

Its a pretty broad category and one which thousands of other sites operate in. But nonetheless, I have given it a go because it is something I enjoy and is interesting (to me).<p>In the 3 years I&#x27;ve had it, we&#x27;ve had some very good days, but the rest are pretty average or even poor. The biggest roadblock to growing it is during the summer months, I am almost completely inactive on it as other commitments take up most of my time to think up, research, and craft articles.<p>I have tried a lot of free advertising options - for example, sharing some (ok, a lot) of articles here but I don&#x27;t want to spam HN which I practically did when I first found this place. Rarely they are hits, most times not (which is understandable). I am also on some promotion websites. Of course, with little traffic reading the content, it means they never get submitted to places like Reddit or here which can drive lot of traffic. And while I&#x27;m on social media with it, there isn&#x27;t usually much response there either as the accounts only have a couple dozen followers.<p>But basically, I came to ask, especially if you have a website&#x2F;blog&#x2F;forum, what you did to grow yours and also how you found some people to help you do it.<p>Getting anyone to help write a few articles here and there has been extraordinarily difficult, even now that I have started offering guest writers the chance for a backlink if it is connected to the article.

After 3 years, I graduated with a decent GPA (&gt;3.6) and a couple internships at a large tech company.<p>- In college, I always felt like I had to work a harder than most of my classmates in order to get the same result. I would regularly spend 60 - 80 hours per week on schoolwork.<p>- Upon graduation, I accepted a job with the company I interned with and have worked there for ~1.3 years. However, I&#x27;ve been prepping to jump to a different role for a few months now.<p>- Recently (past 1.5 months), I&#x27;ve spent 1 - 3 hours per day on tech interview prep using CLRS, Cracking the Coding Interview, etc. My current target is a role at one of the &quot;big four&quot; tech companies or a high-quality startup doing either webdev or infrastructure engineering.<p>- So far, I have interviewed for and been rejected by no less than 10 different roles. I was also rejected by approximately 20 companies during college. I always fail during tech portions.<p>- I am REALLY bad at algorithm problems and experience serious performance anxiety. Concentrated studying and mass interviewing haven’t led to positive results so far. I can solve most problems correctly given enough time (usually 2x+ longer than interviews).<p>Questions:<p>1.) Does there ever come a point where it just isn&#x27;t worth it to continue trying to be a software engineer who can get into top-tier companies &#x2F; projects?<p>2.)

They have the ability to track my phone GPS and also some of my accounts. The scale of this operation exceeds what I or anyone I know would be able to afford, or what a PI firm would be able to conduct. Recently the photograph behaviour has become more overt. It&#x27;s not gathering useful info, it&#x27;s more like overt harassment when they do it so obviously. I&#x27;ve confronted a few of them and when I ask questions about who sent them, they just say it&#x27;s none of my business, to which I reply -- it is my business but when you come and do this, and if you don&#x27;t want it to be, don&#x27;t come around no more.<p>Apart from making some reports about this -- and fighting back through confrontation and taking their photographs...what would you suggest to further turn the tables and obtain some information?<p>This has happened outside my native country, and in Taiwan and Hong Kong, and elsewhere. The nationalities of the people involved have been diverse, as have their backgrounds. But their pattern was the same.<p>They&#x27;ve also tried to drug me, hit me with a car and have threatened to hit me with a car. So I&#x27;m thinking this is probably not the state level intelligence op under lawful guidance. What other types of organizations have these capabilities? Do large criminal organizations employ surveillance as a harassment technique? maybe some people I knew were involved in that and that is why this has happened. Do there exist private surveillance consultants that can and do conduct operations like this worldwide using people from different nationalities? What types of people are usually employed by such firms? ...There&#x27;s certainly an aspect of people vulnerable to blackmail who have been doing this -- like people with some kind of troubled, or criminal, or Sdebt-ridden past. They don&#x27;t seem like professionals in any sense. I picked up on that in the ones that I&#x27;ve interacted with. What does kind of organization or operation is this?<p>Has anyone else encountered something like this? What is this kind of operation usually used for? Is it just a way of applying psychological &#x2F; physical pressure? What is some advice to counter it?<p>Edit:\nWow looking at the comments. I suppose it is hard to believe. So I think the important thing to take from your skepticism is that proper documentation is important.\nLook maybe I do have some mental problems. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d know if I did. But what has happened is real. Someone I know told me they knew consultant was hired but didn&#x27;t know anything more about them. Answer advice: rather then deluding yourself that it&#x27;s not true, give an answer from the assumption that it is. I get it you guys would feel you were fantasizing if you were in this situation but  that&#x27;s just reflecting you, it&#x27;s not what is actually going on here. It&#x27;s really not your place to argue with the facts of this. You know even less about them then I do.<p>So if I was doing this to you and I didn&#x27;t want the story to get out, the first thing I would do is cast doubt on your reliability as a witness and suggest you&#x27;re not capable of making valid testimony due to mental illness. So, I think it&#x27;s valid to ask what&#x27;s your motivation mtmail et al?<p>So I&#x27;m trustworthy in my other post and not in this one? Can&#x27;t have it both ways mtmail unless you want to be deliberately fake.<p>And what&#x27;s wrong with getting fired for being too opinionated and working on my project myself? I get if you&#x27;re too much of a lemming to think for yourself, but maybe try it someone instead of trusting someone else to do it for you. Or keep being a slave if u prefer it that way, mtmail.<p>And by the way. Someone comes to you with a real problem and your response is to tell them they&#x27;re wrong and you don&#x27;t believe them. They&#x27;re open and honest and vulnerable and That&#x27;s your response. That&#x27;s not very nice, and it just really reflects you, commenters.<p>So let me make it clear. You fuckers freely admit we live in a surveillance culture, and you just flat out dismiss the validity of this. That&#x27;s what happens with rape culture in India and the middle East.a woman is hallucinating. And if she wasn&#x27;t then she gets an honor killing. Your blindness is complicit in the culture you pretend is so bad. Fuckers.... But who cares what you think? You&#x27;re just idiots who have no idea about the facts or morals. Or maybe you&#x27;re just too cowed to speak out. Probably. Cowards. So enough said to the deniers and apologists.<p>Thanks for the encouragement paint man, but I think your solution is too extreme. I&#x27;m gonna do more like stand my ground and fight than run and hide. But I do appreciate you seeing it clearly. Thanks!

But my paranoia for the security holes and&#x2F;or bloat of the code kicks in every time I see a <i>&quot;npm install [insert-js-framework-here]&quot;</i>.<p>The <i>&quot;Angular 2.x — Quick Start&quot;</i> tutorial [1] walks you through the process to setup your project and before you write your first component you already have ~83MB of files via NPM <i>(or ~112MB if you choose the TypeScript tutorial)</i>. Same with React.JS which requires a bunch of dependencies mostly related to the Babel project. Why is this? Wasn&#x27;t Angular just a single minified file that you could include in your website and then start writing your custom code? Why are there 264 directories in the <i>&quot;node_modules&quot;</i> folder?<p>Sure disk space is cheap nowadays, the problem is that I feel my project is bloated from the beginning. How can I justify the inclusion of 10,170 files (JavaScript or not) from the normal installation of the latest version of Angular.JS? The <i>&quot;releases&quot;</i> page on GitHub points to an archive with 1,321 files [2]. Is the minified-JS-file era dead? Is NPM the future that front-end developers want?<p>I would prefer to stay in the back-end development side and leave this JavaScript madness to the masochist front-end developers that seem to enjoy over-complicated solutions, but many companies nowadays expect you to know at least one JavaScript framework. Maybe I should forget about React, Angular, etc and learn something like Vue.JS which seems simpler, and if it is not — because I haven&#x27;t used it in production yet — it at least has a single-file installation [3].<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angular.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;js&#x2F;latest&#x2F;quickstart.html<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;angular&#x2F;angular&#x2F;releases<p>[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vuejs.org&#x2F;js&#x2F;vue.min.js","time":1473956912,"title":"Ask HN: How to justify the bloat of modern JavaScript frameworks?","type":"story"},{"by":"gonification","descendants":9,"id":12507482,"kids":[12511672,12507615,12508255,12510632,12507611,12513594,12513596],"score":8,"time":1473956865,"title":"Ask HN: What is the cleanest code sample you've seen?","type":"story"},{"by":"wikiwawa","descendants":58,"id":12507487,"kids":[12507857,12507827,12508154,12508686,12510514,12509602,12509607,12509518,12508882,12508022],"score":66,"time":1473956877,"title":"Why Law Firm Rankings Are Useless","type":"story","url":"http://blog.litimetrics.com/2016/09/15/quantifying-the-value-of-better-legal-representation/"},{"by":"ApsOps","descendants":30,"id":12507448,"kids":[12508604,12508247,12509097,12508724,12510259,12508329,12508172,12509014,12508330,12508468],"score":86,"time":1473956610,"title":"411 – An Alert Management Web Application","type":"story","url":"https://fouroneone.io/"},{"by":"teslacar","descendants":2,"id":12507404,"kids":[12507641,12507516],"score":4,"text":"Who else has had a negative experience on these stock&#x2F;overflow sites?<p>You get down-voted for asking questions and no one bothers to answer the question.

The device should not require constant watching, so that it possible to watch on a screen with generated embedding. Also I wish this device to be commercially available and cost less than thousands of dollars.<p>For case of two dimensions the solution is well known: mouse or touchpad.<p>For case of four dimensions the touchpad solution can mostly be generalized: it is possible to use two touchpads, for right and left hands. A quick way to implement it is to use a touchscreen phone&#x2F;tablet with with two virtual touchpads on it as a such input device.<p>But for cases of higher dimensions it becomes more complicated. It is possible to use MIDI control devices for music producers like this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.djtechtools.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;midi-fighter-twister , but while it doesn&#x27;t require constant watching (unlike virtual knobs on screen), it allows to change only two parameters simultaneously (because one hand can rotate only one knob at time).<p>There is a motion tracking wear system: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11946790 , but I don&#x27;t like the idea of wearing a special costume when I sit at my computer, I prefer an external to my body solution as
