Since my very first job out of college was a contractor job.<p>You see, I was offered a contract-to-hire job at a web agency as a Junior SWE but the W-2 &quot;hire&quot; part never happened.

I mean that with workplace relations I don&#x27;t feel a sense of camaraderie. Especially when I work as a remote contractor.<p>I lack the career wisdom and maturity of a typical 10+ year engineer.

Build up a network and a reputation that is expected of a 10 year software engineer? I started going to meetups more, though not always easy to go to the downtown ones due to parking and time constraints. But I&#x27;m going to a few of the ones I can.<p>I already have built several personal projects online, as a result of the boredom of unemployment.

I think we can reduce our family spending to the point where we could take a family pay cut but do work we find fulfilling that ultimately makes a difference in the world.  In my mind the goal would be to somehow have a formula that gives 50% of every placement to charity and the rest to cover payroll and overhead until we reach our 150k total salaries at which time everything short of overhead would go to charity.

We needed about 200 clips for each language. It took so much time to create just a few. I was pulling my hair out. Especially with the thought of having to check all the clips for changes in a month from now, manually.<p>You’ve probably seen a few online tutorials with outdated and confusing screenshots. You probably have a some outdated screenshot in your own manuals. I get that, it is just too much work to keep these updated manually.<p>So we created Cliperado, to automate this.<p>How Cliperado works. Cliperado takes full page retina screenshots of your online service. It can take screenshots of pages behind a login screen as well, by filling out forms, clicking on buttons or hover over menus, etc , etc. You can crop a screenshot, add arrows or highlights, to create clips for step-by-step guides. Cliperado hosts these clips online.<p>You can schedule Cliperado to refresh the screenshots weekly. Changed screenshots are highlighted in the visual sitemap, so you don’t have to hunt down changes. When you expect a screenshot to change with every refresh, you can mask certain areas, to exclude these from comparison.<p>We hope you want to give Cliperado a try.

I quickly rejected this because that’s not how this world works.<p>We had a long talk early this year where I laid out all of my issues and concerns. He decided to show his commitment by taking 1 day off of work to help sell the new software and work on product development.

HN! We’re Vince and Jun, the founders of Nabis (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getnabis.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getnabis.com</a>). We are building a software and infrastructure solution to ship legal cannabis products for brands to licensed dispensaries throughout California.<p>About two years ago when the legalization of recreational cannabis was pending in CA, we were excited as consumers to be able to try out a variety of products without having to get a medical card. While we knew that many more brands were coming to market, we discovered that there was a lack of supply chain infrastructure to support the growing demand. We started out driving our own personal vehicles across the state to help a friend ship his products just to learn more about how the supply chain was set up. We learned that brands were still predominantly self-distributing, since you can’t just Fedex cannabis products due to compliance restrictions. Apart from shipping, the lack of secure warehousing space, a ubiquitous cash-based payment system, and vague new regulatory language all created massive friction to building a sound and cost-effective supply chain for cannabis products.<p>Once we started shipping more orders than we could deliver ourselves, we hired a team and built out a web portal that automates the most tedious parts of our operations, especially with regards to compliance and paperwork for shipping, storing, and testing cannabis products. We wanted to help scale the growing cannabis industry that was about to legalize, and convert more of the illicit black market into the legal market.<p>When recreational legalization commenced in January 2018, we applied for our distribution license since that would allow us to continue building our business as the logistics backbone for the industry. We thought distribution was the best place to start as it sits right at the center of the supply chain as the final checkpoint before products are sold into the retail market. By scaling out distribution, we help drive down the costs for everyone in the industry due to the economies of scale that we can achieve by owning one set of infrastructure for multiple brands, rather than having each brand build out its own delivery and warehousing solution.<p>Today, Nabis tracks and delivers over 1,000 SKUs for nearly 40 of the largest brands to 90% of retail dispensaries in California. The data that we track gives us insights into the cannabis market as it continues to grow rapidly, providing data-driven metrics of what brands and product categories will perform best in the market. We want to continue to support as many products that consumers love by ensuring reliable shipping and logistics of products to retailers. By expanding our infrastructure and portfolio of brands, we’re hoping to achieve our ultimate goal of scaling cannabis access to the masses and become the widest distributor of cannabis products.<p>Thanks for reading and hope that you continue to support the legal cannabis market! We’re looking to build a community of technologists to grow a data-driven supply chain for the cannabis industry, so we’d love to talk to you if you’re interested in working with us. Also, if you&#x27;re well-versed in logistics and working in regulatory landscapes, we&#x27;d love to hear from you. And we&#x27;re very curious for feedback in general! Looking forward to comments, and you can also email us at founders@getnabis.com.","time":1552756348,"title":"Launch HN: Nabis (YC W19) – Cannabis Shipping and Logistics","type":"story"},{"by":"micheda","descendants":10,"id":19408810,"kids":[19411390,19411261,19411887,19411236,19418777,19411978,19412774,19412058],"score":62,"time":1552755765,"title":"Reviewing Zeppelin and Jupyter Notebooks","type":"story","url":"https://www.stratosphere.dev/posts/2019/Mar/16/reviewing-zeppelin-and-jupyter-notebooks/"},{"by":"enjoyz","descendants":57,"id":19408735,"kids":[19409229,19409408,19408932,19409091,19409066,19409104,19409015,19409191,19409595,19409130,19438905,19409216,19410925,19409076,19409209,19413155,19412893,19427505,19409929,19409464,19409079,19409124,19410097,19409214,19413473,19409630,19409452,19409083,19409353,19420967,19409220,19409136,19409506],"score":34,"text":"Due to the proliferation of many advanced JS libraries such as React and Angular, do you think jQuery is on its way out?

Users leave their coffee on the scale, then we detect the perfect time to trigger re-orders. We ship the scale for free when customers buy their first bag.<p>We met in college, and bonded over talking about businesses we could build together. You could say we&#x27;ve kept in touch since then: we&#x27;re now married. Bottomless was born out of our frustration managing our household stock levels. We always seemed to be running out of one thing or another.<p>When we thought about it, we realized that restocking was a universal problem.<p>But if this was such a big problem, why was there no great solution? Subscriptions should be a solution, but they don’t work well for items that aren’t used on a set schedule. It seemed that if we could capture data on usage and stock levels in a passive way, we could solve the problem. Thus, Bottomless, the concept, was born.<p>The market for stuff people repeatedly buy is enormous. (We&#x27;ll leave an exact estimate up to the reader&#x27;s imagination.) We decided that to start we&#x27;d establish a beachhead with a single market. We landed on selling premium coffee because it&#x27;s cheap to ship and has good margins. It also is much better shipped straight from the roaster than bought at the grocery store.<p>In the beginning, we built the simplest thing possible to test if the concept would work. We hacked together a scale prototype, made five of them and got them into the hands of friends. We bought coffee from roaster websites with our customers’ addresses to bootstrap supply.<p>The goal was to test if people would leave their coffee on a scale, and if we could reorder at the right time. It turns out they would and we could!<p>Since then, it&#x27;s been a matter of making larger batches of scales. We bought a few 3D printers and acquired quite a few burned fingers from soldering.<p>We&#x27;ve benefited from a few technological tailwinds. For one, smartphone supply chain has driven down the cost of components quite a bit. We&#x27;ve been able to build hardware that works for this business model out of super cheap WiFi modules and LiPos.

After being fed up with the poor customer experience and tactics of traditional banks, we did some digging into why we put up with our own subpar banks. We&#x27;ve discovered that the way most people end up with their current bank is by default (ex: parents set it up for them), rather than by choice. The complete opposite was the case for credit cards; credit cards were actually chosen based on their qualities.<p>We began to wonder why a solution that combined the rewards and benefits of a credit card, with the simplicity of a bank account didn’t exist. After extensive research and testing of various existing products, we determined that everything came up short for our personal needs. That was the problem.<p>Whether it was simply the lack of a clean mobile user experience, or rewards that were relevant, nothing managed to fit the bill. Since banks are a fundamental part of our everyday modern lives, we shouldn’t have to settle for a less-than-stellar experience just because that’s the current standard. That’s when we realized, we don’t have to settle. This was an exciting enough realization for us all to quit our day jobs as product managers, designers, and engineers. We decided we needed to create a revolutionary bank.<p>In order to solve this problem, we created a new-and-improved debit card. We are focusing our efforts on debit because it is currently the most popular payment method. Although debit is the preferred method, in the real world, there is little incentive to use one over the perks offered by credit cards. This unfortunately leads the majority of the dissatisfied group to settle for credit cards, with their offer of limited perks that typically come hand-in-hand with unavoidable debt.<p>Our business model is sustainable because we are partnered with a smaller regional bank and don’t have the hefty over head of a branch network. The reason we don’t see larger banks offering debit cards with rewards is because of the &quot;Durbin Act”; a federal mandate which slashed interchange margins of banks with more than $10 billion in deposits. This was done in order to protect consumers and merchants from increasing and predatory prices that banks were trying to instill.<p>If successful in our mission we hope to keep the up and comers out of un-necessary credit cards and raise the standards of user experience for banks. There is no reason why dealing with your bank should be as dreadful as the DMV.<p>We look forward to hearing your thoughts on what we are building and are open to any and all suggestions.

It&#x27;s pretty unambiguous - entire paragraphs lifted.  This competitor was acquired by a larger company in an adjacent space by the time I discovered this.  Making matters even trickier, this larger company had at one point for a partnership and&#x2F;or acquisition.<p>Now the acquiring company is, due to the acquisition, competing with us.<p>If someone who had no conflicts of interest had discovered this, what would be the most responsible method of disclosing this, and to who?  I want to understand what the general practice is in this kind of situation,  so as to avoid tainting the accusation with the appearance of self-interest.  Telling potential clients or partners about it, especially those who are doing business with other company, seems like it would be looked upon poorly even though the information is accurate.  Telling the other company about their baggage is another alternative, but there are a lot of ways that could go wrong too.  Doing nothing doesn&#x27;t seem right, but it may very well be the best choice from an ethical perspective, if not from a financial one.

If a startup is hoping to give up 10-20% stake in the company after their seed round, the majority of the funding is going to have to be at a high valuation after already giving up 7%.<p>Say I&#x27;m trying to raise a $1.5M seed round, the math requires a post-valuation of ~$10M and give up ~20% OR a post-valuation of ~$16M and give up ~15%. IMHO, those are sky high valuations for an early startup.<p>While having a high valuation means your company is valuable (and the YC brand helps with that), the company is already offset by the YC $150k. This could cause trouble for your next round of funding for reasons pertaining to existing and&#x2F;or new investors expectations if the trajectory doesn&#x27;t stay rocketship.<p>Let&#x27;s just presume the downside of joining YC is the high valuation after a seed round. So what are the benefits?<p>1. Easy access to investors - I think this matters tremendously to folks who are brand new to startups. But useful if you are already connected through your existing work or academic affiliations? At the end of the day, all investors are looking for great companies and they are trying to find you too.<p>2. YC Mentoring - YC startups have probably endured the majority of pitfalls, challenges, and issues that can occur. Their experience is super useful and valuable, but 7% useful?

My co-founder Sam and I first met back in 2016 while I was working at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (focusing on financial services in Africa), and he was earning his Ph.D. in computer science at the University of Washington (researching mobile money security in Sub-Saharan Africa).<p>As you may know, the way that mobile payments are made in many developing markets is quite different from how they&#x27;re made in the rest of the world. In much of Sub-Saharan Africa, people make payments using mobile money, an electronic wallet service that is typically tied to a user&#x27;s cell phone carrier and sim card. Using a 39-46 digit sequence of short codes (i.e. dialing a code such as <i>150</i>30, waiting for a screen to pop-up, dialing another code and waiting for that screen, repeat, etc.) that are received by the user&#x27;s cell phone carrier, a user can request to send money to a friend, pay a bill, or purchase airtime all without being connected to the internet and accessible via smartphone and basic feature phone alike. (M-Pesa, which you may have heard of, is just one of the many such mobile money services offered in Sub-Saharan Africa).<p>While mobile money has undoubtedly transformed the way that millions of people transact, the process of executing a mobile money payment is time-consuming, arduous, and prone to error, resulting in a less than ideal transactor experience. After moving back to my home country of Tanzania in 2017 and conducting 700+ on-the-ground interviews, Sam and I founded NALA, the first internet-free mobile money smartphone application. NALA interfaces with existing mobile money providers (M-Pesa, Airtel, tiGO etc.), and provides users with a simple Venmo-like payment experience. To deliver this capability, NALA has built a USSD automator tool to send requests over existing USSD channels.<p>Our product serves as a central platform where users can initialize payments for all of their mobile money accounts (having multiple sim cards and mobile money accounts is extremely common in Sub-Saharan Africa as inter-network transaction fees are lower than out-of-network fees), and for the first time ever, access their transaction histories through our rich transaction tool. While we will make a percentage cut for every bill payment and airtime top-up that is conducted on our platform, we are primarily focused on growing our active user-base.<p>As Sub-Saharan Africa mobile money usage proliferates ($860+ million in daily transaction values and close to 400 million mobile money accounts), smartphone penetration approaches 40%, and the  fastest growing middle class of any continent comes into its own, we believe there is massive potential to transform and shape the African payment space. Building a product that thoughtfully addresses our users&#x27; financial challenges is what excites and energizes us. The pernicious transaction fees that mobile money users are subject to is an area of particular interest and focus.<p>We would love to hear about HN&#x27;s ideas and experiences in this space, as well as answer any questions you might have!","time":1552597503,"title":"Launch HN: Nala (YC W19) – Internet-Free Mobile Payments App for Africa","type":"story"},{"by":"GordonS","descendants":599,"id":19393688,"kids":[19397826,19396181,19396066,19396859,19395093,19395223,19395173,19394861,19395553,19397101,19395124,19396814,19395739,19394722,19396310,19395780,19394874,19397291,19399378,19395016,19396076,19398957,19398881,19399062,19395818,19394823,19396235,19395440,19395785,19395393,19398842,19395878,19394696,19397383,19395906,19398862,19394915,19395403,19395341,19395710,19396193,19394938,19397499,19405032,19396913,19399986,19394767,19398861,19396254,19394604,19398944,19398812,19396118,19395714,19399129,19396234,19397895,19405060,19396783,19399337,19395423,19398261,19397744,19395828,19395599,19396207,19398753,19396787,19405420,19395168,19394730,19399710,19397065,19464615,19399978,19399494,19398126,19396485,19398776,19396817,19395377,19399065,19395400,19395312,19395454,19396488,19395475,19394756,19399729,19397954,19397748,19396265,19396956,19397005,19395769,19411560,19395870,19396833,19396866,19398265,19404573,19396626,19395404,19397335,19397274,19396330,19396938,19399262,19395432,19399800,19398038,19396990,19395970,19394743,19396385,19396723,19396820,19403698,19399447,19394590,19396756,19396698,19396345],"score":521,"time":1552597372,"title":"My Salary Progression in Tech","type":"story","url":"https://georgestocker.com/2019/03/14/my-salary-progression-in-tech/"},{"by":"tomohawk","descendants":64,"id":19393551,"kids":[19393717,19394505,19393978,19393776,19393873],"score":24,"time":1552596523,"title":"EPA Looks to Move Forward with Blending More Ethanol in Summer Gasoline","type":"story","url":"http://www.thedrive.com/news/26947/epa-looks-to-move-forward-with-blending-more-ethanol-in-your-summer-gasoline"},{"by":"smacktoward","descendants":2,"id":19393509,"kids":[19393740,19397654],"score":3,"time":1552596328,"title":"Remington and Other Gun Companies Lose Major Ruling over Sandy Hook Liability","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/nyregion/sandy-hook-supreme-court.html"},{"by":"jaredwiener","descendants":198,"id":19393500,"kids":[19394584,19394456,19393983,19393905,19394216,19394104,19393840,19394125,19395418,19398938,19397995,19393816,19395659,19393893,19396410,19395213,19393904,19396976,19398664,19395074,19395009,19395472,19394261,19393964,19394907,19394839],"score":304,"time":1552596263,"title":"Tumblr has lost 30 percent of web traffic since December","type":"story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18266013/tumblr-porn-ban-lost-users-down-traffic"},{"by":"coffee--","descendants":41,"id":19393486,"kids":[19394072,19394057,19394042,19393960,19394414,19398331,19395825,19395313],"score":125,"time":1552596193,"title":"Firefox enables deprecated Fido U2F Support for Google Accounts","type":"story","url":"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.platform/q5cj38hGTEA/lC834665BQAJ"},{"by":"knbknb","descendants":53,"id":19393432,"kids":[19394572,19394859,19394489,19395138,19394553,19395038,19395431,19398407,19394816,19394601,19394853,19400261,19394993,19395688,19395615,19402462,19441723,19394728,19396003,19395258,19396425],"score":152,"time":1552595900,"title":"The Bitter Lesson","type":"story","url":"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html"},{"by":"pkiller","descendants":210,"id":19393279,"kids":[19393977,19394511,19394344,19403270,19401623,19394593,19398933,19394536,19395134,19399245,19394080,19400096,19399088,19402997,19394642,19394334,19401748,19398262,19404148,19399994,19394211,19394581,19394171,19407737,19395580,19395324,19403559,19394726,19400109,19396900,19394152,19407825,19399715,19394206,19401174,19405877,19394774,19404820,19406859,19399554,19408360,19411538,19400896,19397966,19396585,19396039,19398616,19394317,19396083,19403544,19403857,19394845,19412860,19394603,19398609,19394423,19395585,19397766,19401035,19408102,19395998,19413223,19397285,19402917,19394384,19396776,19397267,19396054,19408891,19395751,19422627,19395936,19396154,19398914,19402972,19395644,19400841,19394145,19394274,19395394,19405892,19397950,19397399,19397646,19399742,19411460,19414772,19419698,19415386,19400346,19398221,19399856],"score":2690,"time":1552595103,"title":"Show HN: A retro video game console I've been working on in my free time","type":"story","url":"https://internalregister.github.io/2019/03/14/Homebrew-Console.html"},{"by":"helplessfounder","descendants":10,"id":19393178,"kids":[19393519,19395186,19393471,19393298,19393330],"score":4,"text":"I quit my job a year ago to start my own business and I have an MVP ready now.\nI love all the aspects of running a business except doing sales.\nAnd to be honest, I hate it.

feels threatened by TransferWise and penalized us for using them.<p>Paperspace is a semi-remote company with employees spread around the world. Several years ago, we discovered TransferWise as an easy and affordable way to make international payments.  We have since been using the tool to pay all remote employees. For those of you that are not familiar with TransferWise, it’s a UK based startup with the mission of lowering the costs associated with international money transfers. The crux of this problem is that banks use a fake exchange rate (made up by the bank) which costs companies collectively billions of dollars. It’s a dubious practice which IMO should be regulated but that’s a topic for a separate conversation. In any case, TransferWise is loved and trusted by thousands of organizations like ours and is backed by leading investors such as Richard Branson, Andreesen Horowitz etc. They have over 1,000 employees and move over $4B per month. In other words, they are legitimate.<p>So, what happened?  My guess is, Bank of America decided it didn’t like that using a competitor and decided to freeze our account.  We lost all ability to transfer money and had to scramble to pay vendors, make regular payroll (in the US) etc.  To get up and running again, we were instructed to fill out a 16 page form on paper about what our business does that we had to wait up 48 hours to regain access to our money.  We are in the midst of this process.  We were on the phone all day yesterday and were told there is no way to expedite this process and that we would just have to wait until they got around to validating the information in the form.<p>I wanted mention this here as a warning to all TransferWise users and to hopefully draw attention to this nefarious practice such that banks stop the nonsense immediately.<p>Happy to answer any questions.","time":1552585241,"title":"Bank of America froze our account because we use

It lets you add places and attractions you&#x27;re looking to visit to a doc, export them to Google Maps, and collaborate with your friends who&#x27;ve been there or are going there with you.<p>We used to plan our trips using Google Docs and Sheets, but it was a pain. We&#x27;d write the documents, then had to add the same places to a map for when we&#x27;re on the trip. We also often sent these out to friends who asked -- there&#x27;s nobody whose recommendations you trust more than your friends -- but it&#x27;s hard to find which friends have these docs.<p>We built Travelchime to solve this. With Travelchime, you can:<p>1. Add all the museums, restaurants, and places you&#x27;re staying&#x2F;want to visit to a doc on Travelchime, and see them on a map with their opening times, links to Yelp, and more<p>2. Share the doc with friends on the trip or ask others for recommendations: multiple people can edit&#x2F;suggest at the same time, just like Google Docs [1]<p>3. Export the places to Google Maps for when you&#x27;re on the go<p>4. (Optional) Read some itineraries from around the web to get inspired! We use basic machine learning [2] to parse itineraries for the places they mention to help get you started<p>5. Once you’ve gone on the trip, you can share the full itinerary with notes to inspire your friends<p>We haven’t monetized, but will eventually link out to hotels that work well with your itinerary and get affiliate commissions there.<p>We&#x27;ve gotten a ton of support from Hacker News in the past: when Yale shut down our courses website, Hacker News rallied and got the attention on it to save it (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=7060261\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=7060261</a>), and past HN launches (e.g., for WrapAPI: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11423070\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11423070</a>) got us our first paying customers.

We use AI to semi-automatically collect and label training data for tech companies, and help them implement machine-learning based features faster.<p>Almost all the magical AI features that we see are actually built using training data powered by humans. Companies build software tools and farm out to a bunch of people to click and type things repeatedly to label the raw data. That&#x27;s how training data is made, and that’s a very large portion of what an AI is, up to this point. It has worked well up to now, but the process is not very fast and often prone to error. Moreover, the size of training datasets has increased exponentially over the past few years, as it almost guarantees a higher AI performance. AI engineers are now handling datasets as large as tens of millions of images, and thus there is a great need for a better way to build training data.<p>We started out as a team of five — Hyun (myself, CEO), Jungkwon (CTO), Jonghyuk and Moonsu (AI Engineers), and Hyundong (Operations), and after about a year, we are now a team of thirteen members. We have backgrounds in robotics, computer vision, data mining, and algorithmic programming, and we all worked together at a corporate AI research lab for around two years. While working on various projects from self-driving to StarCraft game AI, we experienced first-hand how building the training data was one of the biggest hurdles for developing new AI-based products and changing people’s lives. We initially tried to solve this problem from an academic perspective and published a research paper on using coarsely labeled training data for machine learning [0]. Soon, we decided to work on a more practical and widely applicable solution to this problem and that’s why we started this company.<p>So how do we use AI to solve this problem? There are largely two approaches we take. The first is, we try to automate as many pieces of the data building pipeline as possible using AI. To do so, we split the process into many smaller steps. If we take an image-labeling task, for example, putting bounding box labels around each object can be split into 1) scanning the image to find the type and location of each object, 2) drawing bounding boxes around each, 3) refining and validating all annotations. Some of these smaller task chunks can be completely automated using AI. For others, we build AI tools that can assist humans. And for really difficult ones, we do have human workers to do it manually. It’s a tricky problem because we need to understand what kind of tasks AI can do better than humans and vice versa, and carefully choose which tasks to automate.<p>Secondly, we try to improve our AI components throughout a given data building project using a human-in-the-loop AI approach. The key is that we bootstrap and feed portions of the training data we make back into our AI so that we can fine-tune them on the fly over the duration of a project. For example, we may start a project with a baseline AI (“version 1”), and for every 20% of a particular training dataset we make, we iterate and keep fine-tuning our AI so that by the end of the project we will have AI “version 5&quot; that is specifically trained for the project. So as our AI components improve, human contribution gets smaller and smaller over time, and in the end, we will need very minimal human intervention. Ultimately, we want to make it like how humans learn. We see others do something for a few times, and we quickly learn how to do it ourselves. As our technology improves, our AI will be able to learn from only a few examples of human demonstration.<p>We found out that using AI in these two approaches not only makes the process faster but also more accurate. One of the reasons there is an accuracy problem with existing manual labeling services is that humans have to do too much. They spend hours and hours doing the same clicking repeatedly. But by us making it almost painless for humans to figure out what to do, they not only get through more data but they are not as exhausted or cognitively loaded.<p>Our current customers, including LG Electronics, are from industries ranging from autonomous vehicles and consumer to physical security and manufacturing. A large majority of tech companies have a shortage of AI experts and need to develop machine-learning based features with a very limited number of them. As a result, these companies do not have enough resources to build their own automated data building pipeline and often rely on outsourced manual labor. We can deliver training data much faster and better than these vendors that extensively rely on manual labor.<p>We are extremely grateful to have the chance to introduce ourselves to the HN community and hear your feedback.

I am the co-founder of <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techlitafrica.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techlitafrica.org</a>, an organization that fosters a more technologically literate Africa by building computer labs in African schools.<p>I was raised in Mogotio, Kenya, in abject poverty. At nine years old, I collected wild vegetables on my way from school to cook for my younger sister.  The only way I knew out was by studying. So I studied. I studied hard. And I ended with a full-ride scholarship to Augustana College, IL.<p>I was majoring in Chemistry before I discovered computer science my junior year of college. I loved it. With only three semesters left, I decided to get a degree in it. I also built a school with the aim of fostering digital literacy. I doubled down on my work-study program, got some donations from friends and four months later I launched Zawadi Preparatory (www.zawadiprep.tech). We admitted 30 kids at its launch in January 2016. Barely 3 years later, we are at 150 kids.<p>In summer 2018, we built a computer lab at Zawadi Prep. We collected computer donations, bundled it with elementary OS along with open source education software. There is no broadband internet, so we downloaded terabytes of content for our local server including Wikipedia and Stack Overflow. We showed the villagers how to make a Rails app at our free after school program.<p>I cannot think of a better success story than the one of my seven-year-old niece, Michelle. My friend came over to the lab. Michelle asked, &quot;do you want to see our content?&quot; They were like, &quot;sure.&quot; She then opened up a computer, navigated to `192.168.0.2` and said, &quot;look, we have all these.&quot;  I teared up a little bit. I did not teach any of that.<p>Our goal for 2019 is to build 10 more computer labs in 10 different Kenyan schools. I always wanted to end poverty. To me, teaching digital literacy is the best way I know how. We now have over one hundred donated workstations. To meet our goal, we need a few hundred more.","time":1552437251,"title":"Show HN: Building computer labs in schools in Africa","type":"story","url":"https://techlitafrica.org/"},{"by":"prostoalex","descendants":178,"id":19374531,"kids":[19389956,19389236,19386728,19389763,19389206,19389355,19393026,19393128,19393169,19389202,19389015,19390103,19393199,19392838,19389331,19389488,19389083],"score":81,"time":1552437052,"title":"Volkswagen’s Costly Bet on Electric Cars","type":"story","url":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/volkswagens-costly-bet-on-electric-cars-11552403871"},{"by":"boxstream","descendants":2,"id":19374491,"kids":[19374659,19374664],"score":21,"time":1552436748,"title":"Anjuna releases a free unseal tool for Hashicorp Vault","type":"story","url":"http://docs.anjunasecurity.com/vault-unseal"},{"by":"pseudolus","descendants":18,"id":19374302,"kids":[19376166,19379401,19375552,19376153,19376430],"score":39,"time":1552435050,"title":"India's engineers struggle for work as jobs crisis worsens","type":"story","url":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-election-jobs-insight/ctrl-alt-stall-indias-engineers-struggle-for-work-as-jobs-crisis-worsens-idUSKBN1QT0GS"},{"by":"bausano_michael","descendants":4,"id":19374294,"kids":[19374348,19374505,19374475],"score":10,"time":1552434957,"title":"Monty Python's Cheese shop sketch transcript","type":"story","url":"http://www.mit.edu/afs.new/sipb/user/ayshames/Python/CHEESHOP.PYTHON"},{"by":"danso","descendants":18,"id":19374159,"kids":[19390324,19388230],"score":96,"time":1552433591,"title":"Remembering the burglary that broke Cointelpro","type":"story","url":"https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2019/mar/08/fbi-media-anniversary/"},{"by":"hoffmannesque","descendants":3,"id":19374038,"kids":[19379078,19379629,19380090],"score":58,"time":1552432330,"title":"Bandit","type":"story","url":"https://granta.com/bandit/"},{"by":"nirv","descendants":57,"id":19373991,"kids":[19377634,19374455,19378026,19376946,19377285,19374600,19374658,19376237],"score":149,"time":1552431962,"title":"Scaleway cloud adds AMD EPYC instances","type":"story","url":"https://www.scaleway.com/general-purpose-instances/"},{"by":"resalisbury","descendants":147,"id":19373922,"kids":[19374802,19374396,19373927,19374470,19374437,19374527,19374717,19374483,19374643,19374657,19374450,19374783,19374726,19374628,19374693,19374555,19374796,19374320,19374826,19374241,19374672,19374528,19374407,19374423],"score":165,"time":1552431274,"title":"Bribes to Get into Yale and Stanford?

Axdraft offers free legal documents for startups.<p>We have built Axdraft, because we believe that sometimes founders don’t need 20-page ironclad contract, 2 weeks of negotiations and detailed explanation of all risks. On early stages you just want to have a good, balanced agreement fast to move the deal forward while it&#x27;s hot. The biggest difficulty here is that lawyers push us to perceive contracts as unique and, therefore, not possible to automate. Usually, by saying unique, they mean that there are 20-50 possible variations of a clause in the contract.<p>We are a team of brothers, who combine legal and tech expertise, Yuriy was a lawyer for almost 8 years at one of top law firms in Europe and when he started noticing that even the most complex legal transactions have many patterns, he reached out to his brother Oleg, who at that time was Senior Software Engineer at Booking.com in Amsterdam.<p>We teamed up to try to figure out and automate most common variations and allow any young startup, as ourselves to draft a document, which they need now. We spoke to about 100 founders and came up with a list of top-6 contracts startups use, including: (1) NDA; (2) Pilot agreement; (3) Services agreement; (4) SaaS agreement; (5) SAFE; and (6) Employee onboarding. We are already working on Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Founders Agreement and LoI, which are top-4 documents requested by users. We will be more than happy to add other documents upon your request.<p>Our main differences compared to Clerky, LegalZoom, RocketLawyer and similar solutions are:<p>1.     we focus on startups, which makes the content more tailored;\n2.     we offer documents for free, because I see little value in the legal document itself. The main value of a lawyer, in our view, is in counseling, sharing the liability and providing you assurances;\n3.     we offer plain English description of the implications for each choice you are offered when drafting a document;\n4.     to use Axdraft you don’t have to register, because we want to create flawless and super-fast experience for founders to create legal documents;\n5.     we are happy to customize documents of registered users with their logos, company details and some custom language upon request.<p>We intend to monetize Axdraft by giving an option for startups to submit any document drafted with Axdraft or a document they received from third party for approval or review by a lawyer for a small fixed fee, which would still be much more affordable than engaging a law firm.<p>Currently, we offer founder to founder review, which is not a legal review at all, but more a business advice from a fellow founder, who is eager to share his experience with similar contracts.<p>We estimate the market for this product to be less than 1 bln USD at the moment, but we expect it to grow as the number of startups founded each year increases and as we expand into a larger 7 bln USD market of small businesses (under 20 employees) in the US.<p>We are really excited to hear your feedback about Axdraft. Please try it out at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;business.axdraft.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;business.axdraft.com</a> (registration is not required) and let us know what you

HN!<p>We&#x27;re Ethan, Jullian, and Will. We&#x27;re the founders of Latchel (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;latchel.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;latchel.com&#x2F;</a>). We handle 24&#x2F;7 maintenance for residential property managers and landlords across the US.<p>Ethan was Director of Product at One Planet Ops, the creator of websites like contractors.com, homegain.com, and many other lead gen marketplaces. Jullian is a self-taught developer and designer who has built mobile and web apps, most recently at picmonic.com. Will comes from Amazon, where he helped design and deploy the last mile delivery operations for Amazon Fresh, Prime Now, and Amazon Logistics across the US and the world.<p>Will started the company when his family needed help running the family rental properties. His grandfather managed the properties full time all the way into his mid 90s! Sadly, his age caught up with him and he could no longer take care of the family business after getting diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s. The disease progressed quickly and unfortunately the family did not have a succession plan in place (advice to anyone with a family business: plan the succession early, you don&#x27;t want to spend energy worrying about the family business when you want to focus on taking care of a parent&#x27;s medical or end of life care). Will helped his father with the properties as much as he could while working full time at Amazon but was quickly overwhelmed by the maintenance dispatching and follow-up. He saw that the overall process was very similar to the logistics and delivery problems he was solving at Amazon. After looking for solutions online and calling Ethan to see if he knew of any solutions they couldn&#x27;t find any. Ultimately, we teamed up to build what we couldn&#x27;t find on the market: a service to handle rental maintenance problems and ensure work orders don&#x27;t slip through the cracks.<p>Maintenance coordination is a difficult problem to solve because it is fundamentally a communications problem that isn&#x27;t easily solved by software. First, most contractors are third party and take jobs infrequently from a property manager, so they&#x27;re extremely unwilling to adopt a new process for reporting that work is complete or for getting paid. Second, tenants also interact with their managers rarely, so mobile applications (and even online portals) have low adoption rates among renters. Lastly, property managers face an agency problem: ultimately it isn&#x27;t their properties, it is their clients who own the property. The property manager is responsible for its care and maintenance and wants to be able to have all of the details of what happened and to know why certain decisions were made in case something went wrong.<p>We sell monthly subscription services to property managers to take all of their maintenance calls. We have two paid subscriptions: 24&#x2F;7 Emergency and a premium option where we handle both emergencies and non-emergencies. We also have a free software tier that gives property managers an online web portal for tenant maintenance request submission.

We&#x27;re Eric and Mike, founders of MedCrypt (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medcrypt.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medcrypt.com</a>). Our mission is to make it easy for healthcare technology companies to build cybersecurity features into their products.<p>I (Mike)  was previously a product manager at a medical device company and witnessed an increasing concern about the security posture of Internet-enabled medical devices. This culminated in a couple of big device companies needing to issue recalls for their medical devices due to cybersecurity vulnerabilities. It struck me as an interesting transition from cybersecurity being a compliance requirement and instead a concern when managing patient safety.<p>Being concerned about the lack of resources available to implement data security properly, or at all in some cases,  we decided to build a platform that helps healthcare software and medical device companies properly integrate data security features into their products, while actively monitoring them for vulnerabilities and suspicious behavior.<p>We address this problem by providing our customers with a configuration driven library that exposes a simple API to access data security operations, crypto library versioning&#x2F;vulnerability tracking, key management, and device behavior monitoring.  The features our solution provides also happen to cover all of the FDA’s new requirements for data security in medical devices (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;MedicalDevices&#x2F;DeviceRegulationandGuidance&#x2F;GuidanceDocuments&#x2F;UCM623529.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;MedicalDevices&#x2F;DeviceRegulatio...</a>). These requirements place special emphasis on proper data encryption, signature verification, intrusion detection, and vulnerability monitoring.<p>While medical device vendors could go through the trouble of pulling together open source crypto libraries, certificate authority APIs, and monitoring solutions, or even write some of their own from scratch, we believe MedCrypt&#x27;s platform offers a better alternative. We handle the complexity of integrating open source crypto libraries with PKI and monitoring infrastructure and provide simple API calls for key provisioning, certificate generation, data security ops, and monitoring.<p>Medical device vendors use their account on the MedCrypt platform to tell us about the individual computing components that make up their device, what types of data are stored or transmitted over the wire, and what kind of security is required.  This allows us to point the vendor to the appropriate MedCrypt library (C&#x2F;C++ libraries or bindings for NodeJS, Java, C# .NET, etc.) to use for each component and creates a generic provisioning configuration that the MedCrypt library uses to generate the appropriate key pairs, communicate with PKI, and register CBOM metadata for vulnerability tracking purposes.<p>Once the device and its keys are approved (via our provisioning API or predefined filters) and the certificates and signed configuration are delivered to the device, MedCrypt&#x27;s library uses the certificates and the security configuration to enable simple API calls to secure the device&#x27;s data.<p>For example, after being provisioned, if a glucose monitor is required to sign each set of measurement data sent to a central system called &quot;data-capture&quot;, the API call is boiled down to:<p><pre><code>  int returnCode = glucoseMonitor.dataFor(&amp;securedData, &quot;data-capture&quot;, rawMeasurementData);\n</code></pre>\nUnder the hood the MedCrypt library is using the signed data security configuration to select the cryptography resource, sign the data with the appropriate secret key, construct a data payload that encapsulates the original data and signature for delivery to the &quot;data-capture&quot; server, and (if enabled) registers monitoring events with regard to when and with which keys a signing operation occurred.<p>On the other end, the &quot;data-capture&quot; server can verify and get access to the measurement data through an API call:<p><pre><code>  int returnCode = dataCapture.dataFrom(&amp;rawMeasurementData, &quot;glucose-mon&quot;, secureData);\n</code></pre>\nAgain, underneath, the library is using the configuration to establish what type of security is required for this data and whether it can trust the public key referenced by the signature on the measurement data.  If the public key is trusted and the signature is verified then the original measurement data is returned to the user.  The signature data can also be returned so that the integrity and provenance of the measurement data can be verified in the future.  If enabled, an event is recorded indicating the status of the signature verification and from which device&#x2F;keys it was generated with.<p>The library can also be used to apply security to sockets, encrypt data at the application level, and monitor additional events, all driven by the signed configuration describing the security preferences for this device.<p>When our monitoring service receives metadata about the security events on the device, we can then scan for anomalous behavior. Our behavior-monitoring baselines are developed using the data from multiple classes of medical devices from multiple vendors, giving our customers access to a dataset larger than they’d be able to build on their own.<p>Medical device vendors should be able to focus on building innovative clinical features while using best of breed tools and platforms for things like security. We believe we’re building security tools in a way that optimizes data security without compromising clinical functionality.<p>We’d be excited to hear your feedback, and how you think a healthcare-specific cybersecurity company can help medical device vendors facilitate secure connectivity.<p>Please check us out at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medcrypt.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medcrypt.com</a>","time":1552340402,"title":"Launch HN: MedCrypt (YC W19) Medical Device Cybersecurity","type":"story"},{"by":"all2","descendants":62,"id":19362928,"kids":[19363519,19363768,19364211,19363263,19366413,19364057,19366740,19363568,19363207,19378445,19364604,19388940,19369922,19366313,19380560,19377709,19375332,19364530,19367526,19366620,19366452,19363911,19372917,19367029,19371069,19381736,19384104,19367891,19370389,19364754],"score":112,"text":"Generally, I&#x27;m not doing everything I want to do in my life, and I&#x27;m wondering how other people manage to do all the things.<p>After a conversation here with another HN user[0], I&#x27;d like to ask high-performers how it is they do what they do.<p>First, what do I mean by &quot;high-performer&quot;: someone who is doing what seems like two or more full-time tasks during their everyday life.

When does the choice happen? Did you offload that to a list a week prior? How do you handle feeling overwhelmed? Do you even have a sense of overwhelm when moving in to an arbitatrary task? Do you feel exhausted or mentally non-functional with any frequency? What does your sleep, food, and exercise routine look like? Do you meditate?<p>I just want to know if I&#x27;m lacking something fundamental: something physical (chemical imbalance? gut microbiome?), some lack of character development (do I lack &quot;grit&quot;? am I undisciplined?), or something else entirely.<p>In the case of the conversation in [0], the user has some external motivation; having faced death by cancer, he now wants to live his best life possible.

get older and start to lose the sense of taste, they consistently start to lose weight.<p>·      If someone has surgery on throat and this causes them to lose their sense of taste during healing process, they consistently lose weight.<p>·      If someone takes a medicine that has a side effect of them losing their sense of taste while on it, they consistently lose weight.<p>This core concept is what led me down this path to create this Food Pill Diet. I theorized if you could get food into your body without tasting it then you could help mitigate hunger. The quick overview is that if you don&#x27;t taste food and feed yourself 40 food pills every 2 hours (8 times&#x2F;meals a day) then the hunger hormone ghrelin is kept in check and you can get all your daily recommended vitamins and minerals, be on a 1,000-calorie daily diet, not be hungry and easily lose weight. It worked. I consistently lost 5 lbs every week and just didn&#x27;t feel hungry.<p>In this world of meal replacement drinks like Soylent or Huel I&#x27;m wondering if other people would do what I did or if it seems too crazy?<p>Mind you I really hurt my back, ruptured my L5 S1 disc, and put on a ton of weight by not being able to move much and after a year my doctor ran my blood work and I had high cholesterol (hypertension stage 2), high triglycerides, pre-diabetic, and doctor told me I was heading for early grave so I guess I was really motivated to lose the weight and get healthy again by diet alone seeing I couldn&#x27;t work out the traditional way.","time":1552328824,"title":"Tell HN: I ate only food in pill format for 3 months and lost 65 lbs","type":"story"},{"by":"andrewshadura","descendants":20,"id":19361169,"kids":[19371333,19370970,19372156,19361174,19372705,19372655],"score":49,"time":1552327272,"title":"A (Partial) Defense of Debian","type":"story","url":"http://changelog.complete.org/archives/9971-a-partial-defense-of-debian"},{"by":"sergiotapia","descendants":3,"id":19361184,"kids":[19361324,19361296,19361459],"score":1,"text":"I&#x27;m on Firefox Developer Edition and youtube is so busted on it that I&#x27;m trying to figure out if it&#x27;s the browsers fault, or the website&#x27;s fault.<p>Here are some problems I see on youtube:<p>1.

We&#x27;re building a\nreservable electric car charging network out of shared private and\nhome chargers.<p>As a Nissan Leaf driver without a home charger, charging has been\nalmost a daily headache for me. For many commutes and trips I have to\nask myself, should I drive my Leaf, use Uber, take public transit,\nwalk really far, or just not go? This is due to the walk-in-only model\nof the public charger, which results in unpredictable availability.\nWorse, public charging is growing at a slower rate than EV adoption,\nand the range estimators on EVs are no better than a 10-day weather\nforecast.<p>I used the Plugshare app and it helped some, particularly the couch\nsurfing style of charging where I arrange a 2 hour slot with some home\ncharger hosts. When it worked well, it took out the unpredictability\nand therefore anxiety. However, it doesn’t always work well. Many\ntimes hosts won’t respond to text&#x2F;calls to make the booking, and a\ncouple times I forgot to bring cash&#x2F;check to pay for the electricity\nas the host indicated.<p>My first attempt at this problem was building a webapp that worked as\nan addon to Plugshare where hosts can create a calendar for their\ncharger, and set an hourly price where drivers can pay via credit\ncard. Once that’s set up, the host would paste the unique url to their\ncharger’s calendar in the description section of their Plugshare\nlisting. Long story short, this added as much inconvenience as\nbenefit, and drivers still ended up calling the host.<p>Given enough interests from hosts and based on experiences of a few\ndrivers including myself, I decided to make a second attempt and just\nbuild a better app that focuses on the hosting and reservation flows.<p>After about 2 months of hustling and grinding, we\nreleased ampUp (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ampup.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ampup.io&#x2F;</a>), where users can host multiple\nchargers at flexible schedules and adjustable prices. Since the hosts\nset up sharing calendar for their chargers, the other users can make\nreservations with instantaneous confirmation. We use Stripe to enable\npeer to peer payment with credit card rather than cash&#x2F;check. We know\nEV owners are willing to pay for charging and it’s important for hosts\nto be able to make a meaningful amount if we want to scale this to\nmatch our vision where one day there will always be a reservable\ncharger near where the user is or will be. From our analysis, with a\ncompetitive (to public charger) pricing of $3&#x2F;hr, hosts can expect to\nmake $190-$270&#x2F;month in profit with just 3 rented hours per day.<p>For ampUp, our business model is to charge a flat 1 dollar to the\ndriver per reservation. If we use the $3&#x2F;hr example from earlier, a 3\nhour session will cost a total of $10 to add about 60 miles from a\nresidential level 2 charger. This &quot;fuel&quot; cost is on par with the most\nfuel-efficient gas car which is the Mitsubishi Mirage. These numbers\nare based on Bay Area electricity and gas costs.<p>ampUp already has thousands of hosts, but many of them are listings we\ncollected from all over the internet. The difference in the user\nexperience with those hosts is that we have to confirm the reservation\nwith them, as opposed to our own. This is a temporary limitation in\nthe &quot;do things that don&#x27;t scale&quot; spirit. Our goal is to instantly confirm \nreservations like Airbnb.<p>We sincerely invite the HN community’s feedback on our idea and on the\napp and everything else in this space.

You can download the app at the top\nof <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ampup.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ampup.io&#x2F;</a>.

We’re building Mudrex (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mudrex.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mudrex.com</a>).<p>Mudrex helps traders automate their trading without having to code and spend a lot of time and money building infrastructure. Though we have started with cryptocurrency trading first, our goal is to help anyone who wants to get into automated trading or investing across any asset class.<p>We had been trading cryptocurrencies for some time and were not able to track trading opportunities across 1000s of currency pairs for 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. We thought of automating our trades, but faced challenges like being unable to access historical data, building a testing framework to test strategies on historical or live data, and maintaining connections and orders on multiple exchanges. Also, since it was all coded we were not able to quickly iterate on trading ideas, since for simplest changes we had to dig into code and deploy new strategies to retest them. That also made it hard to have a log of all the trades, strategy changes, back-tests, papers to compare things at one place.<p>After talking to hundreds of traders, we found out almost all active traders were facing the same problems, so we decided to build Mudrex. At Mudrex traders can quickly build any kind of trading strategies using 150+ indicators, 50+ candlestick patterns, price or volume action. They can test their trading strategies on historical and live data to optimise and automate their trading by connecting their order using exchange API keys.<p>Cryptocurrencies are just a start for us and we have been growing very quickly since the launch and getting feedback from more and more people every day. There are millions of traders out there, trading manually across different asset classes just because they don&#x27;t have capital and resources to build an automated trading infrastructure from scratch. We want to solve all of their problems so they can focus on building trading strategies instead of spending too much time on infrastructure issues. One of our users defined our goal as &quot;democratising algorithmic trading and investing&quot; and we are working hard every day to get closer to that.<p>For the next 2 months the platform is free to use but we will charge a $0-$100 monthly subscription fee depending on usage with a free tier available.<p>Next on our roadmap are things like a code editor (where traders can build custom indicators using minimum coding), a marketplace between traders and investors, and integrating equities and forex.<p>We dream of reducing the gap around financial opportunities between the wealthiest and the rest. We just got started and are going to face many technical&#x2F;design&#x2F;operational challenges, but with the help of our users&#x27; feedback and support we feel we can achieve it.

These links are easy to remember and share, so you don&#x27;t have to bookmark or copy and paste them in emails.<p>Each day we use and share hundreds of links to get our jobs done, without considering how long it takes to access and share these resources. It’s one reason why many of us leave tabs open in our browser: we don’t want to spend the 5 to 10 steps to navigate back to that important page. With GoLinks, you’ll be able to deep-link directly into any application with just a simple keyword entered into your address bar. This allows links to be conversational. For example, one employee can create the keyword “go&#x2F;review” to point to the annual review page in Workday. Later in a meeting, that employee can mention, “Remember to visit go&#x2F;review to fill out your annual reviews!” Now anyone in that meeting can remember and access the link “go&#x2F;review”, without digging through their email or Slack.<p>Golink systems are commonly used in many big tech companies such as Google, Linkedin, Twitter and Airbnb, built by internal tools engineers in those companies. These systems have become an integral part of the way tech companies share internal links.<p>When we started our careers in tech, we would often visit each other for lunch at these tech companies and we began to notice the same go&#x2F;links everywhere. In the hallways, cafes, break rooms, posters. fliers and TVs, there would be these keywords prefixed with “go&#x2F;” that allowed employees to quickly access information on their devices. The employee could enter a shortened URL like go&#x2F;food into their mobile browser, or desktop, and could access the lunch menu for that day. An easy and simple concept, but an extremely powerful method for internal communication.<p>Although these systems are ubiquitous in large tech companies, we noticed there was nothing on the market that catered to startups, midsize, or non-tech companies. Companies usually don’t have the time or the resources to build sophisticated internal tools, so we set out to create GoLinks as a Service.<p>The challenge was building an internal tool for companies that may not have any internal infrastructure. For example, large tech companies have infrastructure so when you connect to the company Wifi or access the VPN, you can access the internal company network. This allows users to access the “go” domain on the network, which resolves the deep link redirection. For smaller and midsize companies, employees might be 100% remote or working in a coworking space, or maybe the company never got around to setting up an intranet. We had to build a product that did not rely on assuming internal infrastructure.<p>We were able to replicate the functionality of an internal network, and the simplicity of a short-link redirect system, by creating browser extensions for each of the popular browsers. The extension would proxy the “go” domain to our server and we authenticate and redirect the user to the correct location. Now coworkers can be on any network and any wifi, and as long as they authenticate in their current browser, we can find their company’s internal links.<p>We are startup-friendly—anyone under 10 users can get started completely free—but our main initial focus is on enterprise clients.<p>If you’ve ever used our GoLinks or any company&#x27;s golink system, let us know how it’s changed your daily workflow.

We pull into the restaurant’s parking lot at around 720pm. We park have dinner and then around 8:20pm we walk back to our car and the driver side window is smashed in. Her bookbag and mine are both missing. Inside the bags are (at minimum) my dev laptop Lenovo Txxx and hers a MSI Gaming Series that I just got her. They were in such a rush, they missed my phone and wallet that was in the center console, which am I grateful for.<p>Police show up at 8:45pm. We file a report. As we’re filling out the paperwork, a guy (let’s call him Jim) walks across the street and says “ Hey did you get hit?, so did I..” The thief broke his window also and stole his bag with a laptop.<p>The police starts to explain that laptop being stolen is popular. As he’s explaining, the restaurant owner is able to get the license plate from the surveillance video, &quot;registered in Oakland...&quot;<p>3 hours after the incident, we get a call that they found my girlfriends bag, no laptop ofcourse. It kinda helped. Jim’s bag showed up, but his laptop was also gone. Jim had his passwords written on a couple of papers in his bag, they weren’t interested in that for some reason.<p>This, along with other things the cops were saying paint the thieves as people looking to sell items quickly. The chances of getting my laptops back are less than 5%. The cops seems to think that the top 3 ways to get rid of stolen items is 1. Pawn shops, 2. Craigslist or 3. Facebook.<p>Finally 2 question for HN. \n1. What are other ways to sell stolen laptops? @Dang, my apologies if this is not an appropriate question. If so, please just skip to question #2.<p>2.

Cosmic JS is a drop-in replacement for WordPress that can power content for any website or app. We provide a web dashboard to create content and API tools and resources (REST and GraphQL) to integrate content into any new or existing project. Commonly referred to as a &quot;Headless CMS&quot;, this eliminates the need to build and maintain your own CMS infrastructure. For a monthly fee, you use our CMS infrastructure and can focus on what really matters: building great products and user experiences.<p>My cofounder Carson and I met at a digital agency where we built and managed WordPress websites. We noticed that lots of development time was spent building and maintaining the CMS itself, sucking time away from core application development. Plus we encountered the same CMS problems over and over: automatic updates caused sites to crash, a client would decide to install a bunch of plugins that caused the site to crash, comment spam was a never-ending battle. We began looking for a better way to manage content.<p>This was 2014 and API services were becoming more popular (Stripe, Twilio, SendGrid etc were gaining traction in offloading non-core dev tasks), and it made sense that using an API could be a viable way to deal with content as well. So Cosmic JS was created to be the solution that we wanted to use: one click to add a new project, unlimited projects with a single login, a simple web dashboard to create content, and API tools and resources to integrate content into any new or existing website or app. No CMS infrastructure needed.<p>After much beta testing, we eventually released to the public in 2016. We&#x27;re now powering production websites and apps for hundreds of teams around the world across various use-cases.<p>We know the market for a solution to this problem is big because WordPress, as of this posting, powers 30% of the web. That’s 75,000,000 websites (source: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.whoishostingthis.com&#x2F;compare&#x2F;wordpress&#x2F;stats&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.whoishostingthis.com&#x2F;compare&#x2F;wordpress&#x2F;stats&#x2F;</a>). Plus the need for dynamic content extends beyond websites. Mobile, IOT and other emerging tech are increasingly requiring dynamic, easily integrated content.<p>This is a hard problem to solve because a CMS has to satisfy the needs of both developers and content creators. We&#x27;re different than other headless CMS providers because lots of effort has been made to make the CMS admin dashboard and content integration process as easy as possible for both the developer and content creator. We’ve been told “it doesn’t get much simpler”. We’re also very committed to education and community. We&#x27;re the only headless CMS that comes with a community of developers built-in providing hundreds of apps, extensions, and integrations to learn best practices and teach others. You can get up and running with a variety of use-cases in just a few clicks. And we have a free plan that rewards contributors with a free personal Bucket forever.<p>Check out some of the apps built with Cosmic JS: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cosmicjs.com&#x2F;apps\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cosmicjs.com&#x2F;apps</a>.<p>We&#x27;re excited to be participating in Y Combinator for the W19 batch to help more teams avoid the pain of CMS infrastructure management so they can focus on building great products.<p>We&#x27;d love to hear your feedback and learn more about your personal experiences building content-powered websites and apps!","time":1551981157,"title":"Launch HN: Cosmic JS (YC W19) - API-first drop-in replacement for WordPress","type":"story"},{"by":"amandavinci","descendants":1,"id":19330218,"kids":[19330994,19330675],"score":2,"time":1551980944,"title":"The Roots of Creativity and Genius","type":"story","url":"https://www.supermemo.com/articles/genius.htm"},{"by":"berkeleyjunk","descendants":2,"id":19330078,"kids":[19333400,19330164],"score":3,"time":1551980226,"title":"Why I Hope to Die at 75","type":"story","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/10/why-i-hope-to-die-at-75/379329/"},{"by":"tosh","descendants":104,"id":19330024,"kids":[19332730,19332047,19333331,19331416,19332478,19331122,19331535,19330567,19331738,19330672,19331146,19332240,19333431,19330880,19332024,19335419],"score":247,"time":1551979953,"title":"Scheduling in React","type":"story","url":"https://philippspiess.com/scheduling-in-react/"},{"by":"boonez123","descendants":2,"id":19329952,"kids":[19330256,19329974],"score":2,"text":"I am making the following http request to create a financial transaction on another system.<p>The request follows this path:<p>Http request -&gt; Service -&gt; Third Party(like stripe but not stripe).<p>Should the idempotency_key be put into the http request so clients will have to generate it (most likely a uuid) or alternatively should the idempotency key be generated in the service itself?<p>I&#x27;m putting it out here on hacker news for people who have experience building and maintaining API&#x27;s for financial institutions.","time":1551979540,"title":"Ask HN: Idempotency Key: Where to Generate the Attribute","type":"story"},{"by":"jakejarvis","descendants":9,"id":19329862,"kids":[19330153,19330074,19330589,19333061,19330654],"score":65,"time":1551979046,"title":"GitLab Vulnerability PoC: Exfiltrate and mutate repository via injected template","type":"story","url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/446585"},{"by":"turtlegrids","descendants":9,"id":19329723,"kids":[19330521,19330331,19331173],"score":15,"time":1551978300,"title":"Millennials are piling into Tesla following the announcement of its $35k Model 3","type":"story","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-stock-price-millennials-adding-after-model-3-announcement-2019-3"},{"by":"danteembermage","descendants":2,"id":19329679,"kids":[19345242,19330652],"score":15,"time":1551978001,"title":"The six main arcs in storytelling as identified by an AI","type":"story","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/07/the-six-main-arcs-in-storytelling-identified-by-a-computer/490733/"},{"by":"Pharmakon","descendants":61,"id":19329600,"kids":[19329840,19329983,19330179,19332175,19329890,19332425,19332227,19332261,19332343,19329780,19332239,19333392,19329827,19332096],"score":33,"time":1551977544,"title":"Tesla’s Troubles Mount: Shuttered Showrooms and Sinking Shares","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/business/energy-environment/tesla-stock-strategy.html"},{"by":"colinator","descendants":10,"id":19329603,"kids":[19340417,19348764,19338732,19335058,19333726,19339559,19334713],"score":12,"text":"Would you pay for instant devops help?<p>I&#x27;m good at developing apps and writing code.

Can’t believe that a huge company like you will do this to a common users like me.<p>I have tried MICROSOFT AZURE which is totally real free trial as you need to manually accept Pay-As-You-Go subscription otherwise your service will be stopped &amp; you wont be get charged. They’re honest and transparent to their clients. Hope you’ll do the same to your customers. Please keep them safe from unforeseen charges.<p>It’s been 3 days that I’m not getting a response regarding my refund. I hope you won’t let my family wait that long for the money they badly needed back home.<p>Case ID  5848653751","time":1551965428,"title":"AWS Free Trial Scam (Lets Help This Fellow)","type":"story"},{"by":"oftenwrong","descendants":148,"id":19327929,"kids":[19328125,19328689,19328120,19328723,19328437,19328258,19328212,19328182,19328240,19328117,19328360,19328136,19328156,19329846,19328447,19328254,19328141,19328295,19328359,19328313,19328225,19328259,19328147,19328223,19328395,19328238,19328252,19328257,19328405,19328218],"score":117,"time":1551966360,"title":"Why do poor school kids have to clean up rich commuters’ pollution?","type":"story","url":"http://cityobservatory.org/why-do-poor-school-kids-have-to-clean-up-rich-commuters-pollution/"},{"by":"nkurz","descendants":45,"id":19327573,"kids":[19358216,19358260,19357748,19359060,19358043,19359240,19357803,19359039,19358270],"score":85,"time":1551963024,"title":"The history of “How to Lie with Smoking Statistics” (2014)","type":"story","url":"https://www.refsmmat.com/articles/smoking-statistics.html"},{"by":"dnetesn","descendants":18,"id":19327625,"kids":[19358074,19358524,19359586,19359038,19358091,19357391,19357538,19357369],"score":41,"time":1551963533,"title":"Engineered microbe may be key to producing plastic from plants","type":"story","url":"https://phys.org/news/2019-03-microbe-key-plastic.html"},{"by":"sahin-boydas","descendants":1,"id":19327687,"kids":[19327726,19327729],"score":5,"time":1551964181,"title":"Amazon, Berkshire, JPMorgan health care venture launches website and its name","type":"story","url":"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190306005660/en/Amazon-Berkshire-Hathaway-JPMorgan-Chase-Health-Care"},{"by":"turrini","descendants":83,"id":19327351,"kids":[19328127,19328401,19327668,19328598,19327925,19332457,19329405,19327886,19330758,19327858,19327669],"score":148,"time":1551960259,"title":"ZFS on Linux 0.7.13","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/releases/tag/zfs-0.7.13"},{"by":"ilamont","descendants":13,"id":19327340,"kids":[19329027,19330703,19328527],"score":30,"time":1551960077,"title":"China denies two million people detained in Xinjiang concentration camps","type":"story","url":"https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2019-03-06/bachelet-presses-china-for-un-access-to-xinjiangs-uighurs"},{"by":"wassimdotis","descendants":140,"id":19327264,"kids":[19327509,19330385,19330686,19330921,19331447,19327787,19327504,19330433,19330406,19327646,19327849,19327568,19331181,19331067,19327891,19327459,19331060,19327698,19330631,19331113,19332600,19327494,19327836,19331334,19331165,19331684,19331726,19327511,19330199,19330224,19331979,19327571,19327544,19331210,19331471,19330875,19330216,19331161,19331407,19327694,19327614,19329239,19330626,19334788,19328087,19334724,19333145,19330933,19330323,19327682,19327564,19330818,19335775,19327707,19328086,19351129,19327499,19327773,19327676,19327634,19334546,19327700,19327761,19328294,19330336,19332920,19330462,19327615,19330633,19327779,19331202,19330657,19331874,19331962,19328480,19327909,19327705,19345533,19327577],"score":174,"text":"I tried to use Finder&#x27;s tags but failed to keep things organized everytime.

I carry around three blank notebooks; ideas, self-improvement, and study.<p>The ideas book is for jotting down ideas about things I might want to create. It prevents me from just rushing in.<p>The self-improvement book is a list of things I want to improve on for instance soft-skills like communication or health-related like eating.<p>Study - I tend to write in depth in this book. It contains many notes around algorithms, computer programming concepts I&#x27;m studying or even about books I&#x27;m reading.<p>For each entry, I write the date and time. e.g., Mar 6th 5:37 PM PST (California). I find it interesting to see when I wrote those notes and where I was at the time. I plan to document the actual location going forward as well.<p>2. Eating - I&#x27;m trying to cut back on carbs and sugar. I found over-time it does give me a sluggish feeling.<p>3. Walking - I walk around 3-5 miles every day. I find it relaxing, and it gives me time to listen to audiobooks.<p>4. Sleep - I need to improve this. Typically I go to bed between 1 am - 3 am and wake up at 6 am for work. I want to try and go to sleep around 11:30 PM.<p>5. Remind myself of positive things in the morning. This is something I&#x27;ve been working on lately.

I’m Snigdha, founder of The Juggernaut (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thejuggernaut.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thejuggernaut.com</a>), a subscription publication for the South Asian diaspora. We charge &lt;$5&#x2F;month for original stories on South Asia and its people. I’d love your feedback — new subscribers get a free week trial :)<p>I’m Indian-American and grew up in New York. Being Indian wasn&#x27;t cool growing up. Western media mostly focused on South Asia&#x27;s poverty (Slumdog Millionaire) or stereotypes (Apu, taxi drivers). That started to change as I grew older. I saw more South Asians in the news — from those in spelling bees, which I used to participate in, to presidential candidate Kamala Harris, to tech CEOs like Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella. I realized I didn’t know what was going on in the region or with South Asians nationally, let alone in my own city. My mom would forward me news on WhatsApp and I couldn’t talk to her about it meaningfully. I also found that journalism was becoming targeted: The Athletic for Sports, The Infatuation for food, Blavity for black millennials. And I noticed that as China grew, publications started China sections and readers loved Bill Bishop’s Sinocism, a newsletter with sharp China analysis. But there was no national, inclusive, well-reported publication for South Asians, the fastest growing demographic in the US and the largest diaspora in the world.<p>So, every weekend, I’d write a email newsletter (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inkmango.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inkmango.com</a>) linking to the best articles on South Asia(ns) with my thoughts on a pressing issue, from the Harvard affirmative action lawsuit to South Asian representation in Crazy Rich Asians. The newsletter grew to the thousands. After doing this for a few months, I realized linking to other publications wasn&#x27;t enough. I was craving coverage I wasn&#x27;t seeing. That’s why I decided to figure out what it would take to start a new publication with our own reported stories. We called it The Juggernaut.<p>We are starting with one new story a weekday. Our stories have included profiles on South Asian founders, an interview with comedian Hari Kondabolu, an essay on the erasure of Freddie Mercury&#x27;s brownness, and an exploration of the rise of the Subtle Curry Traits Facebook group.<p>Media is difficult. People like free content. We launched behind a paywall because it allows us to pay journalists well and quickly, and invest in better journalism. And paid doesn’t mean exorbitant. I’d love to know — what publications do you read and why? What makes you want to pay for something? What pitfalls should we watch out for?

Dockup spins up on-demand environments so engineering teams can quickly test their code changes. When you open pull requests, Dockup creates disposable environments automatically and delivers URLs to your chatrooms; engineers don&#x27;t have to wait their turn to manually deploy to a staging server for testing their code changes. Anyone in the team can then click on these URLs and preview features before merging pull requests. Because each environment has all the services in the tech stack, it lets you catch bugs which usually happen only in production.<p>My co-founder and I were colleagues at our previous job (for ~6 years) where we worked as consultants, mostly working on Rails, React and Elixir projects and had the luck to work closely with many engineering teams. We often saw that teams would slowly lose confidence in their code as their codebases and team sizes grew and code changes would take longer to ship. At a payments company that we worked for, things often worked fine in dev but broke in production and eventually they started having company wide meetings before teams could deploy anything to production. Wanting to help developers ship faster and with more confidence, and also to scratch the itch of writing something in Elixir, we started building a tool as a hobby project, which eventually turned into our product.<p>Honestly, at first I thought that if we could build it, anyone else could build it internally too and no company would pay money for this, until we actually started talking to companies which have done it. We learned that it usually takes a few months for a developer to build an internal tool that automates PR review deployments. Most engineers told us they don&#x27;t like having to support this set up and keep it running after they&#x27;ve built it and moved on to solving other problems. We faced many problems on the way, for example - the need for pre-seeded prod like databases for testing features, being able to support architectural changes (for example, adding a message queue in the tech stack and testing it with Dockup) etc. We have now reached a place where we are able to onboard most of our customers without having to build custom features each time. We are excited to share what we have built with all of you!

happens, longer-term, to the founders that fail? There&#x27;s many forms of failure, according to PG [1] it&#x27;s simply a matter of &quot;keep going, don&#x27;t get demoralized&quot;, but from my limited perspective (I&#x27;ve never started a startup) it&#x27;s more complicated than that, you can also literally run out of money (either personally, or as a company not getting more investment), <i>or</i> you can rationally decide to stop because the value proposition just isn&#x27;t there in the market (noone needs it, or they need it but aren&#x27;t willing to pay enough for it to sustain it). So, my conclusion is that startups sometimes fail for &quot;good&quot; reasons.<p>What happens to founders afterwards? Do they start another startup? Do they continue in a &quot;job&quot; (career)? Do they start from scratch or move immediately into a management position? Are investors willing to invest into failed founders? Are companies willing to hire them? Do they value experience (similarly to an MBA, or similarly to an employee, or not at all)? Maybe they get hired by VCs to either mentor other startups, or help decide if they&#x27;re worth investing in?<p>The opportunity cost of starting a startup instead of continuing in your career can be significant (5+ years &quot;lost&quot;).

I&#x27;m in a program Minnesota offers called PSEO, which lets me attend college at no charge while in High School. But, quirky thing here, I was homeschooled and finished 12th grade curriculum already. Because I am technically in 11th grade, I am currently in the spring semester of a year of free community college full-time, and the next year will also be free.<p>So far, I have taken Calc I and some electives (writing, MN History) to cover generals. This semester, I am doing my best in Calc II, Statics, and two other electives. My plan is currently to cover my generals at the community college (which is free through PSEO) and then transfer to get my Engineering degree. Before college, I wrote a program for my homeschooling provider which I recently open-sourced at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19286084 (enjoy the code!).<p>I&#x27;ve been doing some thinking though about my life recently and am having doubts. Calc II is really hard for me (though, my head tells me, I&#x27;m 17! What do you expect? Many college entrants are just doing College Algebra!), and it isn&#x27;t that I&#x27;m not up for a challenge, but I&#x27;m having more doubts as to whether I really want Engineering over, say, a computer repair technician or something similar.<p>I&#x27;m not A+ certified, but I seriously believe that if I took a week or two of practice and review, I could get it.

We make better carbon nanotubes at one-fifth the price. Carbon nanotubes are a form of nano-scale carbon fibers (5,000X thinner than human hair) with remarkably high strength, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity properties. This makes them useful in a variety of commercial applications.<p>Lithium-ion batteries designed for electric cars already use carbon nanotubes to reduce heat generation during charging and to improve electrical conductivity. This results in faster charging and improved battery life. However, the cost is so high ($300&#x2F;kg) that battery manufacturers are forced to use the minimal amount, rather the optimal amount.<p>Our breakthrough in manufacturing cost enables battery manufacturers to use the optimal amount, allowing electric cars to safely recharge in 10 minutes or less. This could give electric cars the boost they need to replace gasoline engines.<p>The idea to start the company grew from an idea posed to me by my Dad back in 2012 - is there a way to transform carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into something valuable? I thought this would be an exciting challenge because most carbon dioxide technologies at the time were focused on storing it in underground caverns or converting it into commodity chemicals where it would be difficult to profit without substantial government subsidies.<p>After reading an article about Tesla’s intentions to only source raw materials that were sustainably produced in North America, we settled on developing a low-cost electrochemical process to convert carbon dioxide into graphite. Graphite is an essential energy storage material used in lithium-ion batteries. After deciding on the product, my Dad and I put together a small team of chemical engineers to help with the patents and applications for grants from the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation.<p>When we received our funding, we began work with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to construct small batteries to test the material we had made. We noticed that some cells would charge three, or sometimes five times faster than commercial reference materials. So we pulled the cells apart to have a look at the graphite with a high-powered microscope. All of the fast-charging graphite was matted with tiny hairs (I later learned that it sounds cooler if you call them “carbon nanotubes”).<p>We thought about it for a few days and did some research. We eventually figured out that certain metals we had tested in our production process were likely responsible for the growth of carbon nanotubes. So we isolated those metals to test the theory. It worked!<p>Now we had a process that could either grow carbon nanotubes or graphite  - both at an estimated cost under $5&#x2F;kg. The difference being that the market price for battery-grade graphite is $10&#x2F;kg and the market price for battery-grade carbon nanotubes is $300&#x2F;kg.<p>If the price of graphite is reduced from $10&#x2F;kg to $5&#x2F;kg, electric cars get a bit less expensive and the market expands a bit more. If the price of carbon nanotubes is reduced from $300&#x2F;kg to $5&#x2F;kg, electric cars cold potentially charge in about the same amount of time it takes to refill a tank of gas, which could create exponential growth in the electric car market. We discussed this with our grant manager and agreed that it made sense to pivot and scale up the carbon nanotube process - which leaves us here today in W19.<p>What’s different about our technology is that we produce carbon nanotubes through the electrolysis of molten carbonate salts. The electrochemical reaction produces carbon (nanotubes), oxygen gas, and metal oxides, which are further reacted with carbon dioxide to re-generate the carbonate salt starting material. So the net reaction is the input of energy to drive the conversion of carbon dioxide to carbon nanotubes and oxygen.<p>Industry has been using chemical vapor deposition to make carbon nanotubes since they were first discovered in 1991. We believe that our platform is better for a few reasons: 1) electrochemistry is tunable and this gives us control over the size and shape of the nanotubes, so they can be custom-tailored for specific battery chemistries and applications outside of energy storage as well; 2) the energy requirement for our manufacturing process is estimated to be 27 kWh&#x2F;kg, five times less energy intensive than chemical vapor deposition; and 3) our technology represents a value-added use for carbon dioxide, and if powered by electricity from renewable sources, would have a negative carbon footprint.<p>I think the reason nobody has commercialized this production method yet, or come up with some other high-efficiency process, is because chemical vapor deposition is relatively simple to operate and relatively simple to scale. Billions of dollars worth of chemical vapor deposition infrastructure are already established, and historically, there haven’t been many new market opportunities that would justify investing in new technologies to drive down cost.<p>Only recently have researchers demonstrated the potential for carbon nanotubes to improve the performance of new applications like advanced energy storage, high-strength carbon fibers and composites, lightweight electrical wiring, and concrete composites for roads that don’t crack. If carbon nanotubes were less expensive, these new applications could be worth billions while also creating sizable reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. It is our mission to bring new markets like these to life and to develop new products that best take advantage of what our carbon nanotubes have to offer.<p>I believe that we are best positioned to break this cost-curve and bring this technology to market because molten carbonate electrochemistry is not a well-known science. What we’ve learned since our foundation in 2012 is not commonly taught in universities. Our knowledge was acquired through hands-on experience and in-house development of intellectual property.<p>Hopefully some of you folks are also interested in carbon nanotubes, or at least share a mutual dislike for carbon dioxide. I’m looking forward to sharing some ideas with everyone!<p>-Drew","time":1551721989,"title":"Launch HN: Saratoga Energy (YC W19), Better Carbon Nanotubes from Carbon Dioxide","type":"story"},{"by":"jharohit","descendants":4,"id":19303373,"kids":[19304501,19303781,19303526],"score":1,"text":"My dad is a Physics grad who has spent his entire life in Accounting and Taxation.

For instance, I just submitted an LA Times article whose original title was:<p><i>Newsom’s shorter California bullet train plan likely to run out of money before completion</i><p>The original title is 90 chars.

Without going into specifics the idea is about collecting data from governmental health-related resources, augmenting the data (eg identifying user-provided locations through Google Maps), joining across different data-sources, canonicalising etc, and then allowing the user to search through it in a way that&#x27;s IMHO much more intuitive than what&#x27;s provided in the original resources. In addition, given that official sources tend to be obtuse my aim was to simplify the information and make it understandable to the layperson.<p>Now given that this is centered in the health-industry privacy becomes even more pivotal as I wouldn&#x27;t want some random SaaS company collecting information pertaining to my health and selling it or utilising in nefarious ways.<p>Thus, I was thinking, what better way to prove that my service is doing none of that than open-sourcing my code and offering the paid service as the way to use it. Would that &#x27;gesture&#x27; be enough to put peoples&#x27; minds at ease and prove that I have no intention or desire in tracking them?<p>As an added bonus I was hoping that open-sourcing the code would help reinvigorate my resolve as my velocity has been dropping and my self-preservation instincts have me second-guessing my idea and its usefulness. Part of me was hoping that open-sourcing the code would: (1) force me to do it better cause people other than me may see it (2) help validate the idea and its marketability (3) potentially let interested parties help me make the code better and (4) allow me to use other open-source-friendly services like CI&#x2F;CD for free since in the interest of keeping this service as private and &#x27;true&#x27; as I can get it I&#x27;m doing it all out-of-pocket and am not interested in receiving funding for it.<p>What do y&#x27;all think?<p>Edit: I should&#x27;ve mentioned that I&#x27;m well-aware that someone may scoop my idea, do it better&#x2F;faster, and I would have contributed to someone else&#x27;s potential success.

We help US contract workers automatically find tax write offs in bank statements. We do this by monitoring their purchases for tax deductible expenses -- like phone expenses, insurance payments, and home office expenses -- using a team of accountants aided by fancy computer stuff.<p>The company is born out of frustration with how many people doing 1099 gig work -- rideshare, taskrabbit, online tutoring, and so on -- are overpaying on taxes. By our estimates, the average gig worker overpays on taxes by 21% (for context, that’s around $2,000 if you earn 40k) [1]. A fancy accountant could prevent, but fancy accounts are expensive. That’s why we’re building Keeper.<p>But it’s more than just a low price. We want to make something accessible to people who don’t actually know much about taxes, or care to (i.e. most of us). That’s why we think the solution is to tell, not ask, when it comes to tax deductions.<p>Your monthly phone bill is a great example. Many gig workers wouldn’t think their phone bill is a tax deductible expense. However, it’s partially deductible since you undoubtedly use your phone for work. But that sword cuts both ways -- many people will eagerly try to deduct haircuts, clothes, and other personal effects. The IRS is very strict that these are not tax write offs, so these folks risk getting themselves in trouble for an understandable mistake.<p>The user experience is: we text you yes &#x2F; no questions a few times a week. Examples include “Hey, was today’s lunch at McDonald’s shared with clients &#x2F; coworkers?”, or “Do you use your Spotify account to play music for your rideshare passengers?”. The text messages are partially automated, but we hire an accountant to monitor things and jump in when needed. At the end of the year, you can export your write offs seamlessly into TurboTax, H&amp;R Block, etc to file.<p>We’re currently piloting the service with +100 paying users. We charge $10 per month because it’s simple, but eventually want to move to a model where we charge a small percent of the tax write offs we find for you. Aligned incentives :)<p>Thank you HN! Looking forward to hearing your ideas and feedback!<p>[1] 21% stat is based on comparing a sample of eleven 1099 contractor’s 2017 tax returns against what we found when digging through their bank statements. Biggest sources of this discrepancy is missing the home office deduction, forgetting to claim car insurance payments and other non-obvious transportation expenses, and forgetting to track business meals.","time":1551465938,"title":"Launch HN: Keeper Tax (YC W19) – Find tax writeoffs in bank statements","type":"story"},{"by":"ptr","descendants":7,"id":19283803,"kids":[19294191,19295884,19306974],"score":40,"time":1551464841,"title":"The Meta-Circular Evaluator (2016)","type":"story","url":"http://www.rooijakkers.software/posts/2016-04-25-metacircular-evaluator/"},{"by":"dangayle","descendants":3,"id":19283794,"kids":[19366967,19284110],"score":1,"text":"I&#x27;ve never seen an entry level product manager job, only jobs that require years of experience.

We’re Anna and Kerry, co-founders of Searchlight (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.searchlight.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.searchlight.ai</a>). Our software helps candidates be judged by their past performance rather than their resume or where they went to school.<p>We built this product to help job candidates and hiring managers. With platforms like Linkedin and Indeed, hundreds of applicants with indistinguishable resumes apply for the same job with just one click. Kerry and I both have backgrounds in software engineering, and we were frustrated by how time-strapped hiring managers increasingly over-index on the “snob test” (a.k.a. where the candidate went to school) or contrived technical screens [1][2]. We’re also twin sisters who went to the same school and worked at the same companies. We look indistinguishable on paper, so we are especially keen to bring a new product to the hiring space that will allow candidates to express their individuality beyond their resumes. When we looked at the landscape of current hiring tools, we realized that the majority of them are self-promotional (resumes, personal websites, Linkedin, etc) and difficult to substantiate at first glance. This disadvantages people who aren&#x27;t good at promoting themselves, or don&#x27;t like to, and these are often the best candidates! We saw that a poorly conducted technical screen can penalize the most talented engineers. Worse yet, we learned that take-home coding challenges are a real pain point for certain demographics, like parents who don&#x27;t have the time to thoroughly attack a 24 hour coding challenge because they have to take care of their kids.<p>This made us think - why are we ignoring the the perspectives of people who actually know what it&#x27;s like to work with a candidate? This data is the most indicative of success on the job [3][4], but isn&#x27;t currently being leveraged until the end of the process, if the employer conducts reference checks. This is why we built Searchlight to better assess candidates early in the hiring process. Currently, we work directly with employers to invite their applicants to the platform. Job seekers can invite as many advocates as they want to speak to their accomplishments and capabilities (some invite as many as 10). The references share feedback like specific examples of how the candidate demonstrated desired competencies and how future managers can set the candidate up for success. Then, we analyze this feedback to assess candidate-position compatibility by matching the requirements of the role to the candidate&#x27;s strengths. Our recommendations for strong candidates are based on a mix of quantitative factors like average ratings of core competencies, and qualitative factors like work style and environmental fit (which we currently human QA). One of our core beliefs is that every candidate is exceptional in their ideal environment, so all the feedback gathered on Searchlight - regardless of whether the candidate gets an offer - is saved and available for the candidate to use and share.<p>We aim to make the hiring process more fair. We are building trust and legitimacy into our platform by tying each reference to a specific job experience, verifying references through work emails or Linkedin profiles, and keeping the feedback hidden from candidates. While no tool is perfect, we know that the insights surfaced by Searchlight allow for better decision-making than traditional resume scans, with no extra time commitment for employers. We are especially excited to see that Searchlight is already helping diverse applicants get to the on-site interview stage after being initially screened out.<p>We&#x27;d love to hear about your experiences in today&#x27;s hiring process and if Searchlight would be helpful to you!

It’s been used to find tens of thousands of critical bugs in open-source software (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.chromium.org&#x2F;p&#x2F;oss-fuzz&#x2F;issues&#x2F;list\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.chromium.org&#x2F;p&#x2F;oss-fuzz&#x2F;issues&#x2F;list</a>), and is a great way to generate tests that cover a lot of code, without requiring your developers to think of every possibility. It achieves such great results by applying genetic algorithms to generate new tests from some initial examples, and using code coverage to track and report interesting test cases. Combining these two techniques with a bit of randomness, and running tests thousands of times every second has proven to be an incredibly effective automated bug finding technique.<p>I was first introduced to fuzzing a couple years ago while working on the Clusterfuzz team at Google, where I built Clusterfuzz Tools v1 (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;google&#x2F;clusterfuzz-tools\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;google&#x2F;clusterfuzz-tools</a>). I later built Maxfuzz (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;coinbase&#x2F;maxfuzz\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;coinbase&#x2F;maxfuzz</a>), a set of tools that makes it easier to fuzz code in Docker containers, while on the Coinbase security team.<p>As we learned more about fuzzing, we found ourselves wondering why very few teams outside of massive companies like Microsoft and Google were actively fuzzing their code - especially given the results (teams at Google that use fuzzing report that it finds 80% of their bugs, with the other 20% uncovered by normal tests, or in production).<p>It turns out that many teams don’t want to invest the time and money needed to set up automated fuzzing infrastructure, and using fuzzing tools in an ad-hoc way on your own computer isn’t nearly as effective as continuously fuzzing your code on multiple dedicated CPUs.<p>That’s where Fuzzbuzz comes in! We’ve built a platform that integrates with your existing GitHub workflow, and provide an open API for integrations with CI tools like Jenkins and TravisCI, so the latest version of your code is always being fuzzed. We manage the infrastructure, so you can fuzz your code on any number of CPUs with a single click. When bugs are found, we’ll notify you through Slack and create Jira tickets or GitHub Issues for you. We also solve many of the issues that crop up when fuzzing, such as bug deduplication, and elimination of false positives.<p>Fuzzbuzz currently supports C, C++, Go and Python, with more languages like Java and Javascript on the way. Anyone can sign up for Fuzzbuzz and fuzz their code on 1 dedicated CPU, for free.<p>We’ve noticed that the HN community has been increasingly interested in fuzzing, and we’re really looking forward to hearing your feedback! The entire purpose of Fuzzbuzz is to make fuzzing as easy as possible, so all criticism is welcome.","time":1551290580,"title":"Launch HN: Fuzzbuzz (YC W19) – Fuzzing as a Service","type":"story"},{"by":"abhshkdz","descendants":5,"id":19265172,"kids":[19265185,19270511],"score":22,"time":1551289565,"title":"Habitat: A fast 3D simulator for embodied AI research","type":"story","url":"https://www.facebook.com/yann.lecun/posts/10155814693622143"},{"by":"brokenwren","descendants":4,"id":19265096,"kids":[19265129,19265553],"score":5,"time":1551289207,"title":"Got users?

I can&#x27;t find much about it on the internet<p>Full Description:\nTree calculus is a calculus of combinations with a single ternary operator \n(for building nodes) that has three reduction rules, according to whether \nits first argument is a leaf, stem or fork. Its normal forms are the \nunlabeled binary trees, which provide a better basis for computation than \nthe natural numbers: there is no need to encode and decode programs as \nnumbers, as the binary trees are simultaneously functions to be applied and \nstructures to be traversed. There are compositional, reduction-preserving \nembeddings of the traditional models of computation into tree calculus. Also, \nit supports self-interpretation without the need for quotation to convert \nprograms to trees. Tree calculus supports a type system that satisfies \nsubject reduction.","time":1551244139,"title":"Computing with Trees Not

The crowd is super-excited about the demo, however we’d love to give some thought on what Microsoft’s recent release really stands for:<p>1) Turning 2D images into full 3D avatars in few seconds sounds quite challenging. I mean, there’re awesome guys like Wolf3D, but it still doesn’t work just like that even for them. Have a look at Jinha Lee (00:21 on the video)  standing with his back turned to the crowd, this is simply impossible to create out of 2D photos – not online or within seconds - ever!<p>2) Moving on to magical search engine (from 02:10)  with predefined 3D objects: there is a 3D model with animation for every search. Looks more like a fantasy to me.<p>3) There is plenty of black color in the video, while HoloLens holograms are created by adding light to real life light. This means that white appears bright and black renders transparent. To put it simple you cannot see black color in Hololens.<p>Bottom line, we believe the whole thing was a replay with pre-recorded user actions(best case scenario) or a video. What really confuses is why the presented case was this basic. At some point the Mattel CTO states that the remote collaboration gives a faster way to the market + reduces time for travel. This is so true, BUT:  in the remote collaboration demo we’ve spotted just the collaboration part.","time":1551200761,"title":"HoloLens 2 Remote Collaboration is fake?","type":"story"},{"by":"Tomte","descendants":11,"id":19256059,"kids":[19259344,19258490,19258337,19262791,19258620,19263732,19259368,19260641],"score":34,"time":1551200443,"title":"Semantic Linefeeds (2012)","type":"story","url":"https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/"},{"by":"bonyt","descendants":2,"id":19255921,"kids":[19255951,19257305],"score":22,"time":1551199737,"title":"U.S. disrupted Internet access of Russian troll factory on day of 2018 midterms","type":"story","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-cyber-command-operation-disrupted-internet-access-of-russian-troll-factory-on-day-of-2018-midterms/2019/02/26/1827fc9e-36d6-11e9-af5b-b51b7ff322e9_story.html"},{"by":"cauliflower99","descendants":2,"id":19255754,"kids":[19256231,19262148,19255782,19255880],"score":4,"text":"I currently don&#x27;t have access to a good mentor in the company or town I work in. \nDo you have any tips on where I might find a remote mentor who can give me advice on my career?","time":1551198997,"title":"Ask HN: Where can I get a remote mentor (software development)","type":"story"},{"by":"coffeedrop","descendants":107,"id":19255802,"kids":[19261307,19259991,19262416,19260139,19262870,19262462,19260866,19261884,19260399],"score":90,"time":1551199258,"title":"A sold-out city?

The company had not yet been formed with the state of Delaware so I was optimistic the process could be halted.

Nothing happened and then a few days later I got the succession of emails indicating &quot;Congratulations, your (erroneously named) company has been formed!&quot; &quot;Congratulations, another impossible to revert registration has happened!&quot; &quot;Congratulations, we billed you $500 to setup the wrong company!&quot; I made a mistake in signing the DocuSign with the wrong name, but it seemed like their service is optimized for moving things through as quickly as possible (which is what I&#x27;m sure 99% of the people want) and has no tolerance for making corrections.

We’re a nonprofit in the YC W19 batch.<p>Our World in Data is a website that shows how and why global living conditions and the earth&#x27;s environment are changing. Is the world becoming more violent? Is an end to poverty possible? It&#x27;s hard to know because daily news focuses on negative single events, and misses long-lasting changes that reshape the world.<p>We’re a group of researchers from the University of Oxford trying to solve this problem. We bring together data and research from many different sources often buried under jargon in static, outdated documents. We present a global perspective on living conditions and environmental change through interactive data visualizations and short explainers.<p>Max started Our World in Data in 2013 whilst working as a researcher at the University of Oxford. The project was born from a frustration that we are so poorly informed about how the world is changing—we fail to notice the important developments shaping our world and are not aware what is possible for the future. It has now evolved into a full-time project with a small team of researchers and web developers (we’ll be looking for a new web developer this week!). We’re all driven by the same motivation: to make sure data and research on how the world is changing is free and accessible for everyone.<p>We cover many topics, ranging from poverty to health, environment, energy, education, and violence. Our data and analysis are available at global, regional and country levels. And we try to provide the longest-term data we can, often going back many decades or centuries.<p>We average more than 1M users per month; these range from policymakers to journalists, academics to school teachers. But we’ve also had some use cases that took us by surprise: To many readers it’s unexpected to see that the world has made substantial progress in important aspects and psychologists have recently told us that they use our website to help patients with depression and anxiety. We did not expect this use of our work at all and asked them for more details. One of them explained: “Facts can be a powerful weapon against fear, a gloomy worldview, learned helplessness. So I help clients find facts at Our World in Data.”<p>We usually work remotely, because we are not all based in the same country—this is the first time that we were able to find a 3-month window of time to move to California and work together.<p>We come from a university environment and applied to YC because we wanted learn from the startup and the technology world. The work at YC and the contact with the partners and other founders have definitely given us an entirely new perspective on how to work.<p>We’re here at HN because we are sure we can learn a lot from the community here. We knew there had been HN threads on aspects of our work before – but after a recent search (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;OWID-searches-on-HN\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;OWID-searches-on-HN</a>) we had no idea there were so many. It’s amazing to see that these posts created such great discussion within the HN community.<p>Our website is here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;OurWorldInData.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;OurWorldInData.org</a>.

I mainly code in Python, and as I gain experience I find myself reading code written by other programmers more and more frequently. I’m usually reading the code of mature, highly regarded tools (e.g., Requests, Ansible, some lesser-known but clearly high-quality tools), and I can’t help but notice that the people who write this code tend to take a much more object-oriented approach than I do. In particular, they use classes in situations where I would use modules, and objects in situations where I would use dicts or tuples (or named tuples, which I’m fond of). The style I’ve developed so far is to use a module when I’m trying to bundle related functions that don’t manage state, and to use classes when state-management is inherent to the problem and I want to shield clients from it (or “encapsulate” it).<p>On the one hand, I don’t want to blindly imitate programmers who are dealing with problems of a different type (or scale) than those I’m dealing with and end up making my own code unnecessarily complex. I sometimes have an imaginary conversation with a composite “seasoned Python programmer” in which I proudly show him code that I’ve written as a collection of classes, and he looks at me quizzically and says, “Why did you write all these classes to solve this problem?

We pay you to learn to code. We take people with little or no software skills and pay them a livable wage[1] for 5 months while they learn to code, using our content, most of which is open source. In return graduates pay us 15% of their income for 2 years if they are earning over $40,000.<p>The company is born out of a phenomenon I’ve been fascinated with for a long time: many people wake up every day at 7am to work at a low-paying job but they often have difficulty completing a class that might help their future. For some people, it might just come down to money. A job pays now, a class pays off in the future and only maybe. For many reasons--time, energy, motivation, financial pressures--many choose or are forced to choose the job that pays now and their long-term income sometimes suffers as a result. So we had an idea: Why don’t we just pay people to learn? So that’s what we do: we pay people, now, to learn an in-demand skill.<p>I remember back when we were building Leif, a startup we sold last year. I told Dickie, one of our co-founders, if I only had an extra $10,000 I could build out the product to an acceptable quality for a couple months. Otherwise I had to work. He ended up giving the money. We sold the company the next year for a good outcome. That couple months of being able to focus made a big difference in the quality of the product and I think ultimately on how successful we were with customers. We think Modern Labor can give people enough time to make a real change in their lives.<p>Our program isn’t for everyone. It’s full time. We pay $2000 for 5 months. Sometimes that’s more than enough to live on, sometimes it’s not, especially in the Bay Area. Nearly impossible with a family. You need the right to work in the US. The program is mostly self-directed and online. We guide students with a learning pathway and code reviews, but it’s ultimately up to them. If they don’t do their lessons, we don’t pay. It’s far too short for some people. Right now the curriculum is JavaScript (React, Redux) and Python and focuses on the web, which is only one sliver of the software universe. Most of the content is open source. Some of it’s from places like Freecodecamp, which is available for free. If you have money, you don’t need us.<p>15% of gross income is a lot. Why so much? It comes down to simple risk&#x2F;return: returns must be adequate given the risk. If it sounds a lot like Lambda School (YC S17), you’re right. Our former company Leif arranged financing for them. We discovered Austen (CEO) here on HN. It’s a big space, though, and our program is different from theirs. We have fewer mentors and our focus is on giving money to students.<p>How many people will do our program? About 50,000 people pay to attend coding bootcamps in the US each year. We believe, and may be wrong, that a lot more people will choose learning when we pay them to do it.<p>Thank you HN -- HN was the first thing people told me to read when I was learning to code and it’s been a big part of my life ever since.

We’re former athletes that come from sports families—Nick’s the son of Hall of Fame Quarterback, Joe Montana. With sports deeply embedded in our lives, we always wondered what happens beyond the playing field the three of us met on.<p>For years, we ran sports betting pools and leagues for our friends, co-workers and others as a hobby. Things began to take off dramatically, but posed a major problem. The software that we used was outdated and not conducive for managers (ourselves) or the bettors (users). We saw this as a major opportunity to go after due to the gambling laws and space evolving.<p>Within a few short months we’d built an enhanced platform for managers and bettors to play on: Balto. Not only did we notice high retention amongst our users from game-to-game, but the increased social interaction and engagement amongst peers made our platform more sticky.<p>Aside from Balto, the current options for users are third-party websites or large antiquated media companies, which aren’t betting or gaming companies. These platforms prioritize content and ads over a great UX, and completely miss on delivering the social interactions inherent to what makes playing these games (with your friends and family) so much fun.<p>We aim to become the go-to platform that aggregates all betting pool games for casual fans and gamblers. We&#x27;re putting the user experience at the forefront of the product by enhancing the social experience for users, the management tools for league organizers, and placing all of your favorite games onto one, mobile-first platform. It’s a tall task, especially when factoring in the laws, but it’s a space we’re beyond passionate about.<p>To test the product, feel free to visit www.playbalto.com. We’re currently running a free to play March Madness Challenge!<p>Feedback is more than welcome, don&#x27;t hesitate to share in the comments. We&#x27;re eager to hear your thoughts, ideas and experiences in this space.

We make Avo (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.avo.app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.avo.app</a>),  a tool built to minimize human errors and overhead when implementing analytics. We’re going for “simple made easy” for maintaining tracking for cross platform consumer products, where a 1% change in conversion funnels makes a difference. It’s a code-generated, type-safe tracking library to accurately implement analytics events that are defined and maintained in a single-source-of-truth web app.<p>We’re solving a personal pain point of broken analytics and how much effort it was to have an overview of what was being tracked across product teams and platforms. We all worked together on a game called QuizUp (100M+ users) where we used metrics to make decisions.  The problem was we repeatedly “broke” conversion funnels and retention charts we relied on when we shipped product updates, by mistakenly removing or changing analytics implementation.<p>It was driving everyone involved mad – so we built internal dev tools and processes that made implementation easier and our data more reliable. What we built was never perfect, and it was clunky in many ways:<p>1) There was no one that really <i>wanted</i> to maintain this – but developers ended up agreeing to maintain it because it was better than the alternative of frustrated data scientists requesting a fix for analytics implementation that the developers worked on weeks or months ago.<p>2) JSON files (or the crappy web apps we invested time in building on top of the JSON schemas) didn’t give us a “human-accessible” overview of what was being tracked and when. So people who weren’t working on analytics every day had no idea what data they should look at to dig into user behavior.<p>We also discovered that a lot of companies build similar stuff – i.e. some version of internal tools for data validation, either through code gen or through server-side validation, often based on JSON schemas. The same seems to apply for those companies; it’s clunky to update, doesn’t give a proper overview, and no one <i>wants</i> to maintain it – yet it beats the alternative of not having it.<p>So now, six years after we started maintaining tools like these internally, we’ve built Avo, to solve these issues for more people.<p>Here’s how it works:<p>1) The web app is built to optimize the experience of maintaining and version controlling complicated event schemas. That means a few things, for example:<p>- we built a “differ” that feels similar to git, but instead of line-based diff, it’s object-based<p>- when you make updates, Avo gives you suggestions to maintain casing and reuse properties across events.<p>- you can view the historical change of each object similar to Asana tasks<p>2) The code gen is optimized for bringing type safety and rigour to analytics implementation:<p>- You install a CLI to easily update (`avo pull`) your tracking library according to the latest version of the event schema. The generated code contains a type-safe function per each event.<p>- For example: A &quot;Cart Updated&quot; event with an &quot;Item Count&quot; property, would generate `cartUpdated(itemCount: Int)` for Swift. For dynamic languages, as well as for limitations which cannot be expressed through type systems, such as min &#x2F; max, the runtime validation logs warnings or errors for data structure errors.<p>Things to note:<p>- Avo does not store, process or access your data – so no GDPR approval required.<p>- The Avo code generated libraries wrap whatever analytics SDK you already use. You can use the Avo library alongside the tracking you already have, or do a full migration to make sure all your events are according to the specs in Avo.<p>- Avo is not another analytics or data pipeline vendor. We love the ones that exist already. We’ve just built Avo to make sure we can use the data we send into them.<p>Thanks for reading, HN. We would love to hear your feedback, as well as stories of when you built this internally or when you wish you had this.","time":1550682250,"title":"Launch HN: Avo (YC W19) – Minimize Human Errors When Implementing Analytics","type":"story"},{"by":"Academic_Quiet","descendants":9,"id":19209646,"kids":[19211343,19216711,19214906,19212831,19209673,19209791,19214479,19227777],"score":6,"text":"For reasons, it&#x27;s important that there is no virtualization.<p>I know of Scaleway, which offers ARM Systems on a chip.

(work habits, social interaction, etc)<p>My off-the-cuff thought was to ask for them to work on a smallish issue on an open source project they haven&#x27;t contributed to before. After the work has been done, they&#x27;d come in to be interviewed about what they did and how it worked out. If this was a standard process, they&#x27;d be able to use the same work for multiple interviews, so job hunting wouldn&#x27;t be such a huge burden. It also gives them a chance to showcase a few skills that I&#x27;ve found important in my own career (navigating a new codebase, integrating and testing a bugfix&#x2F;enhancement, interacting with team members). It would also have the nice side effect of providing some motivated help for open source projects.<p>That was just a quick stab at the issue to use as an example, I&#x27;m sure it has a number of fatal flaws.

Because less code is exponentially more customer satisfaction and money. It&#x27;s simply more happiness for the developers (and the user).<p>When you have less code, you have less code to write, you have less code to read, you have less code to understand, you have less bugs, you have a smaller team, or, for the same budget, you have more time to do new features and bug fixes, you then have more customer satisfaction, you then have more money for even more features and bug fixes. <i>All</i> at the same time.<p>The way I see it, nothing beat that.<p>I would even stretch a bit: it seems to me, it makes judging programming skills very easy. Take a source, can you reduce it without impacting the user? if yes then bad coder else good coder. As simple as that.<p>How come this is completely disregarded? For example, does triplebyte tests applicants for their ability to do less code? It&#x27;s not my recollection.. How come? I would even prefer a complete beginner that I&#x27;m sure do less code, than a senior who pisses lots.<p>Hopefully this will lead to an interesting discussion.

I love the industry and will likely be transitioning into a private equity type role soon, but I have always loved the startup industry. One day I hope I can leverage my knowledge in real estate with prop tech.<p>But over the last year or so I’ve had this idea burning in the back of my mind that revolves around using social media and apps to get people to reconnect, in person, rather than online. It’s basically an idea that stems from the fact that social media is taking interactions online and reducing the quality of friendships. I want to leverage a technology platform where its easier and less burdensome to meet people face-to-face.<p>I don’t have a background in UX or CS, but have tried to self teach myself Python and Swift. I realized I will never be an expert soon, so I stopped. However, I’ve begun outlining a business plan for this app idea and begun drawing out sketches of what it may look like. I believe this could become something that’s not only highly profitable but also helps reverse the trend of human-to-human interactions going online, and deteriorating friendships.<p>I live in LA and I’m looking for advice on how I can take this idea and go running with it. I’m willing to spend a significant chunk of money but want to make sure I do it right. This is also considering I work 50-60 hours a week with my day job.<p>I would like to have a technical co founder or hire someone like a student local to LA who believes in the premise of the app as well. I’ve heard nightmare stories of people who go off and hire software engineers from Asia&#x2F;East Europe that turn out to be utterly worthless. I’d rather take my time with this and have someone that I can work&#x2F;hire directly with to develop.<p>Any suggestions or insight would be amazing.

The app would set you up on a blind date with someone based on your interests and personality.<p>You’ll have the ability to list out free time slots, and a budget range. Once the app decides that a particular set of people could be good together, it automatically reserves a table at a restaurant that works for both the parties, is in the said budget range, and inform either party. Every person on the platform needs to verify his phone number, social profile, and scan his driving license&#x2F;passport for safety reasons.

I found a good candidate, and a store in my city appeared to have it in stock. So I spent 15 minutes trying to memorize how to get there, walked for over an hour to get there (didn&#x27;t want to pay $2 for a ride), waited 30 minutes until an employee became available, asked if they had the phone in stock, and learned they they didn&#x27;t. I then walked back home, got lost, and eventually arrived 2 hours later. I then started my search over, slightly tweaking my criteria.<p>After 2 weeks without a phone, over 20 hours of research, and visiting 5 different stores, I finally bought a replacement. It&#x27;s second hand, not exactly state of the art, and I just just found out the vibration motor is broken. But it&#x27;s too late to return it, as I already left the country. I probably would still be searching for a phone if I didn&#x27;t have a flight yesterday as a hard deadline.<p>I&#x27;m now looking to buy a case for it. I must have spent 4 hours on this already.

However, please do not take away the privilege to agree to disagree with each other from topics of conversation where we are still able to act with civility with one another.","time":1550180722,"title":"Tell HN: I'm worried that certain posts are made and deleted to hide news","type":"story"},{"by":"heywire","descendants":62,"id":19166326,"kids":[19167249,19168449,19168695,19167954,19167339,19167106,19167854,19167220,19168152,19167921,19169506,19168213,19170036],"score":230,"time":1550180563,"title":"A RISC-V CPU for $8","type":"story","url":"https://hackaday.com/2019/02/14/new-part-day-a-risc-v-cpu-for-eight-dollars/"},{"by":"ccallebs","descendants":7,"id":19166297,"kids":[19170969,19166328,19169584],"score":2,"time":1550180323,"title":"Show HN: KetoHunt.com – A curated list of keto-friendly products","type":"story","url":"https://www.ketohunt.com/"},{"by":"tareqak","descendants":5,"id":19166268,"kids":[19167109,19166516,19166678],"score":32,"time":1550180003,"title":"FTC and Facebook are negotiating a record fine for privacy lapses","type":"story","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/02/14/us-government-facebook-are-negotiating-record-multi-billion-dollar-fine-companys-privacy-lapses/"},{"by":"markdog12","descendants":103,"id":19166233,"kids":[19167078,19166646,19168286,19166981,19167179,19166884,19167475,19169106,19167550,19169451,19172025,19169868,19166976,19169035,19166571,19168246,19168321],"score":226,"time":1550179704,"title":"Replacing JavaScript Hot Path with WebAssembly","type":"story","url":"https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/hotpath-with-wasm"},{"by":"mariuz","descendants":162,"id":19166201,"kids":[19169125,19168342,19169756,19167851,19168591,19167670,19167669,19167505,19169541,19168943,19169530,19169956,19168478,19170550,19168210,19169364,19168264,19168469,19169672,19169060,19169623,19167793,19168450,19169706,19167529,19169913,19183466,19170259,19168516,19170005,19169169,19169966,19168899,19170193,19170508,19168638,19167914,19169969,19169104,19169802,19176617],"score":204,"time":1550179500,"title":"24 years of Delphi and Delphi 10.3.1 is out Today","type":"story","url":"http://blog.marcocantu.com/blog/2019-february-24-years-delphi.html"},{"by":"steveklabnik","descendants":188,"id":19166020,"kids":[19167280,19167462,19168021,19166744,19169139,19166656,19166756,19166987,19166931,19167161,19167111,19168929,19169412,19170415,19168357,19166911,19169722,19168052,19169116,19166861,19167463],"score":241,"time":1550178374,"title":"Moving from Ruby to Rust","type":"story","url":"http://deliveroo.engineering/2019/02/14/moving-from-ruby-to-rust.html"},{"by":"tujv","descendants":5,"id":19165958,"kids":[19166315,19166094,19166915],"score":32,"time":1550178006,"title":"Dating is a free software issue","type":"story","url":"https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/dating-is-a-free-software-issue"},{"by":"boshomi","descendants":15,"id":19165923,"kids":[19168844,19166261,19166419,19166163,19182675],"score":150,"time":1550177726,"title":"PostgreSQL 11 Reestablishes Window Functions Leadership","type":"story","url":"https://modern-sql.com/blog/2019-02/postgresql-11"},{"by":"howard941","descendants":116,"id":19165877,"kids":[19166881,19166331,19166345,19166298,19166226,19166295,19166313,19171848,19167081,19166391,19166353,19166157,19166407,19175367,19166234,19166279,19166415],"score":121,"time":1550177438,"title":"Americans Cross Border into Mexico to Buy Insulin","type":"story","url":"https://khn.org/news/americans-cross-border-into-mexico-to-buy-insulin-at-a-fraction-of-u-s-cost/"},{"by":"tcarn","dead":true,"id":19165860,"kids":[19165916,19165909],"score":2,"text":"Anyone else having problems?

HN!<p>We&#x27;re Antonio, David, Jason, and Mark. We’re building Glide (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;glideapps.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;glideapps.com</a>). Before this we worked on Xamarin, quicktype, Ubuntu, Mono, and GNOME Do :D<p>Glide makes it easy &amp; fun for anyone to create apps without code. Pick a Google Sheet and Glide assembles a polished, data-driven app that you can customize, share as a PWA, and publish to the App Store and Google Play if you desire.<p>We&#x27;ve spent the last decade building developer tools. In that time we&#x27;ve watched thousands of developers struggle to design, implement, and maintain apps, and most developers we know avoid mobile development altogether.<p>Apart from developers, we hear worthy app ideas from non-technical colleagues, friends, and family every day: apps for work, new business ideas, and silly apps just for fun. All of these people can make websites, so why can&#x27;t they make apps?<p>We were dismayed to find that there are hundreds of &#x27;low-code app builders&#x27;, but none that excited us. They&#x27;re enterprisey, they output kludgy apps, and their low-code contrivances often felt more complicated than the code they replaced. Why hasn&#x27;t anyone made the Google Docs or Figma of apps yet, we wondered.<p>That&#x27;s our ambition. Glide makes app development web-based, collaborative (coming), and fun by combining data-bound components with a familiar spreadsheet model. Spreadsheets are the most successful programming model of all time, and smartphones are the most successful computer, so we&#x27;re bringing them together to enable anyone to create apps without code.<p>We&#x27;ve implemented a component model based on self-adjusting computation (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.umut-acar.org&#x2F;self-adjusting-computation\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.umut-acar.org&#x2F;self-adjusting-computation</a>), which allows Glide apps to update efficiently and continuously just like spreadsheets. You can see the benefit of this in our Comments component, which syncs comments in real-time to instances of the same app. In other words, Glide apps are multiplayer by default.<p>We&#x27;re just getting started and would love feedback on the approach. There are many technical&#x2F;design challenges ahead of us but we are encouraged by the useful apps our users have created with this early version. We even use Glide to build Glide–internally we&#x27;ve created dashboard apps, an app to share updates with our advisors, a directory that shows us which Glide apps are trending, and an app for our YC group.<p>Next on our roadmap: forms, improved image handling, notifications, and offline.<p>- Get started: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;go.glideapps.com&#x2F;?signUp\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;go.glideapps.com&#x2F;?signUp</a><p>- Video demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=smNwrz9wMxU\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=smNwrz9wMxU</a><p>- App templates: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.glideapps.com&#x2F;samples\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.glideapps.com&#x2F;samples</a><p>Thank you.","time":1550161337,"title":"Launch HN: Glide (YC W19) – Mobile Apps from Google Sheets","type":"story"},{"by":"longdefeat","descendants":23,"id":19162978,"kids":[19163185,19168723,19170234,19163295,19165919],"score":47,"time":1550160706,"title":"What happens when social media manipulation targets religious faith?","type":"story","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-the-secret-facebook-war-for-mormon-hearts-and-minds"},{"by":"priansh","descendants":3,"id":19162936,"kids":[19165168,19163089,19166181,19166180,19163090],"score":52,"time":1550160471,"title":"Subtle Asian Dating – Dating Bio Generation with Markov Chains","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/pshah123/subtle-asian-dating-generator"},{"by":"timcc50","descendants":209,"id":19162854,"kids":[19163418,19163611,19165061,19163620,19164945,19163869,19163585,19164355,19163504,19164810,19164049,19165233,19164534,19165068,19164769,19163953,19165181,19170056,19165761,19167933,19167982,19164022,19165884,19166251,19167833,19164644,19167828,19163528,19163829,19164801],"score":234,"time":1550159955,"title":"JP Morgan Unveils USD-Backed Cryptocurrency for B2B Payments","type":"story","url":"https://decryptmedia.com/5173/jp-morgan-coin-cryptocurrency"},{"by":"indy7500","descendants":72,"id":19162876,"kids":[19164881,19166282,19163303,19167331,19163387,19163201,19168302,19167416,19166806,19163204,19163663,19168960,19169031,19163170,19164348,19167677,19165770,19163570,19163169],"score":117,"time":1550160107,"title":"Show HN: Scannable Chess Scoresheets","type":"story","url":"https://www.reinechess.com/"},{"by":"adanhawth","dead":true,"id":19162861,"kids":[19163053,19163034],"score":11,"time":1550159991,"title":"I have rescinded the GPL from a number of people","type":"story","url":"https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/2/4/1065"},{"by":"derekp7","descendants":2,"id":19162839,"kids":[19164285,19162938],"score":2,"text":"I&#x27;ve seen several tools to view your web site using various colorblind filters.

Olly (a Designer from the UK). I’ve been a long time lurker on Hackernews but now I finally have something to share with the community. Along with my friend Oliver (Developer, Sweden&#x2F;Japan) we have been working on Remotewise.io. It’s a new resource and learning platform dedicated to remote work.<p>We’ve both been working remotely for most of our careers. Over this time remote work has been gaining huge momentum as a viable and desirable way to work and we believe it’s the future. We’ve been working on this during our evenings and weekends in between our full-time remote roles, so we’re really excited to be putting it out for you guys. We’d really appreciate any feedback as I’m sure many of you are remote workers yourselves or thinking about going that route.<p>You can check it out here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;remotewise.io<p>So, why did we create Remotewise.io? We noticed it was often tricky and time consuming to find quality and relevant content about remote work and the companies which champion it. We wanted to create a focused, discoverable and beautifully curated list of resources so that you can learn from the leaders in the industry, what it takes to work as a highly effective remote team and how to nurture a healthy remote culture. We see the site as a learning and discovery platform that in the process helps you find the best company fit for you, hopefully taking the pain out of searching for that perfect remote role.<p>We’re launching a weekly newsletter too so if you’re into it sign up and receive the latest updates. We’ll also be bringing you founding stories and leadership interviews in the coming weeks and months. This is just the start of our journey, there’s loads more to come.<p>We’d love to hear your feedback as it’s really early days for us and we’re excited about where we could take it. You can also reach us at hello@remotewise.io or tweet us @remotewise.<p>Massive thanks,\nOlly &amp; Oliver","time":1550149805,"title":"Show HN: Remote working resources","type":"story"},{"by":"AhtiK","descendants":52,"id":19161564,"kids":[19165359,19164243,19163847,19162960,19162778,19163642,19161777,19163541,19163609,19164404,19163775,19165193,19167911,19163971,19170173,19165026,19164280,19171922],"score":295,"time":1550149751,"title":"Data science is different now","type":"story","url":"https://veekaybee.github.io/2019/02/13/data-science-is-different/"},{"by":"deliahu","descendants":14,"id":19161515,"kids":[19176282,19177383,19179042,19166660],"score":86,"time":1550149205,"title":"Show HN: Cortex – machine learning infrastructure for developers","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex"},{"by":"raejumping","descendants":104,"id":19161489,"kids":[19161662,19161681,19161665,19161724,19161835,19161760,19161678,19161791,19161766,19162501,19162048,19161679,19161739,19161710,19161670,19164213,19162097,19161786,19161684,19161827,19167479,19161728,19161789,19161774,19162660,19161694,19161755,19161753,19161812,19161696,19161702,19161729,19161698,19161759,19161663,19161711,19163350,19161647,19161659,19161741,19162122,19189451,19161736],"score":98,"text":"I have immigrated to France for a better life a little over 2 years ago, and I have been working as a frontend developer ever since.<p>I have managed to move from a little under 2000€&#x2F;month as a starting salary to around 2500€ now.

I ask this question because I see far too many companies run into serious problems for not complying with these laws and being devastated by the consequences.  \nIt’s pretty overwhelmingly the case that at the earliest stages of a startup, the founders typically pay themselves nothing.  They are working for equity.  \nThe same is often true for the earliest “employees.”  Often time they are treated as independent contractors, even though that’s not technically legal.  The law probably requires that they be paid at least minimum wage, but the company doesn’t have the money for that.  Instead, again, the work for equity.\nIt seems so unfair when a disgruntled early employee or even co-founder has a lawyer write a demand letter seeking $100,000 in unpaid wages and penalties.  Everyone made an informed decision to work for equity.  Everyone knew what they were doing.  But the law doesn’t care. \nAnd, worse, in California, certain people in a management capacity (like directors) can have personal liability for unpaid wages.\nThe usual response I hear to this is that the law is screwed up and way too employee friendly.  These laws should be ditched and let people enter into whatever employment relationships they want.  We’re all adults.\nI see this as a cop out.  If you look more broadly at the world of employer-employee relations, there is a long, dark history of ruthless employers using the uneven power dynamic to cheat employees.

These systems are typically for tracking, categorizing, and reporting&#x2F;searching on domain &quot;things&quot;: people, tasks, complaints, products, customers, etc. I&#x27;m surprised at the amount of redundancy in typical CRUD stacks. Info about a given field (RDBMS column) and its associations is <i>replicated</i> all over the place. My attempts to produce stacks that factor out duplication seem to confuse other developers such that they&#x27;d rather live with duplication.<p>There are always exceptions (variations) that need to be applied. For example, the default field title of a given field might be too long for a given screen listing, being the user wants to see a lot of info on a single listing. Thus, an exception (override) is needed for that title on that page. A centralized &quot;data dictionary&quot; is useful, but cannot carry the entire load. Further, sometimes the variations need to be computed dynamically.<p>A way to manage these variations is needed that doesn&#x27;t confuse developers. Perhaps if an industry standard were devised, then coders would just learn the factor-friendly system and we&#x27;d end the duplication. It feels to me the industry spends too much time chasing the latest UI trends&#x2F;fads instead of factoring.<p>I find our tools are too rigid to even propose specifics of such a stack. Code and&#x2F;or references to code would need to be managed in something akin to an RDBMS, and not a hierarchical file system nor OOP inheritance hierarchies. Trees are just too rigid. There are tools to automate duplication, but few that avoid it. Auto-dup only helps initial coding, not maintenance.

Things were going quite well at first, shortly after I joined we lost two key development resources - one senior developer was fired, and the other gave his 2 week notice just after Christmas, and was let go instead of being given a chance to finish his project. We have monthly deliverables, and losing two key resources in the middle of a release cycle is obviously going to have some negative consequences. After we (obviously) missed our January deliverable goal for 2 of the 5 projects we were realsing, management called a meeting with the entire development team, chewed us out for missing these deadlines, and informed us that we would be required to work 3 hours of mandatory overtime each day until we are &quot;caught up&quot;. There is no clear definition of when we will be &quot;caught up&quot;, and from our meeting is is clear that the problems started many months before I joined the company.

Our first product is DyScan, an SDK that helps apps stop fraud and process payments faster by taking a picture of a credit card (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;3gzDECAsqXs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;3gzDECAsqXs</a>).<p>We met about 3 years ago at Uber, where we worked together to fight fraud on the platform. (Merchants are liable for fraud losses on digital transactions). One thing we noticed is a problem industry-wide is that while there is tons of investment in detection (rules and models and features), barely any work goes into figuring out what to do to someone after tagging them as fraudulent. Most of the reliable actions - the ones that actually stop fraud - are very severe (e.g., account banning). In order to minimize good users impacted, fraud systems are built to detect very specific fraud behaviors. It is therefore easy for fraudsters to reverse engineer models and rules and iterate around them, which means even more investment into detection.<p>Along those lines, we noticed few companies realize card scanning is a powerful tool to reduce fraud and improve digital transaction security. Stolen credit card fraud is a major contributor to payment fraud losses. Fraudsters attempting to pay with stolen cards rarely have the physical card on hand, but rather, are running through a list of stolen credit card numbers, expiration dates, and cvvs. Having people enter payment information through a card scan will only allow users with a physical card present to go through with payment. It’s extremely rare to have a tool that both improves customer experience and improves security - but an accurate card scanner accomplishes this.<p>In addition to being a powerful tool for fraud prevention, DyScan also provides a nontrivial conversion boost at checkout by reducing time and effort required to enter payment information (under 5 seconds for DyScan, compared to 21 seconds for manual entry). DyScan is also the only card scanner SDK that works on all credit card formats, including non-embossed numbers, numbers on the back, vertical cards, and Quick-Read format cards (those are the weird ones you may have seen around with a four-digit groups stacked on top of each other). Card.io, which is the card scanner experience you may have seen in other apps, works on only one credit card format (embossed numbers on the front of the card).<p>Other card scanners aren&#x27;t great because they were constrained technologically at the time they were built. Due to PCI compliance, credit cards must be scanned on device, and it hasn’t been possible to get a good deep learning model small enough to do this until very recently (due to more neural net processing power on devices and better tooling). The additional benefit of this approach is that it means zero latency, which can make a huge difference in terms of user experience and user friction.<p>How it works: After an app integrates DyScan into its checkout process, their users can enter payment information by holding a credit card up to a smartphone camera. At the same time, DyScan verifies that the card is real and non-fraudulent.

(<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;auravision.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;auravision.ai</a>)<p>Aura Vision is like Google Analytics for physical retail stores. Our mission is to ensure that physical retailers can innovate and improve their stores with data, in the same way their eCommerce counterparts do, while protecting customer privacy.<p>Retail teams often know very little about what shoppers do in-store leading up to a purchase. To try to increase sales, they change layouts, products, and media in their shops based on anecdotal knowledge, and experience. That’s because it’s hard to get good quality data about what consumers actually do in their stores at the moment. Many retailers periodically place people in doorways with clipboards recording shopper demographics and behaviours, which of course is costly and not very scalable.<p>We use existing security cameras in stores to detect the demographics (age, gender, staff&#x2F;customer) and behaviour of all visitors using our proprietary computer vision technology. This creates an anonymised feed of aggregated data for the retailer, giving them new tools to improve their stores. E.g.<p>- To increase footfall, retailers can A&#x2F;B test window displays, selecting the one with the highest peel off rate (the ratio of entries to people walking by)<p>- To uncover why a product is underselling, retailers can learn about the movement and dwell times of different demographics around products.<p>- To increase sales, they can select products that are suited to the demographics in that store.<p>- To increase conversion rates, retailers can identify where customers spend most of their time in-store and locate staff accordingly.<p>We started out in the UK during the birth of GDPR, so we’re acutely aware of the need to protect customer privacy. Video is deleted as part of the processing, and never stored thereafter, and our system never identifies people, nor stores identities. All data is aggregated into 15 minute chunks, which fully anonymises the counts, so you are left with information on the behaviours that the camera observed in that period. Those chunks are supplied back to the retailer through our dashboard and API as heatmaps and counts. We don’t rely on facial recognition, instead taking in visual cues from all features across the body.<p>In contrast many other retail tracking solutions, like Bluetooth and WiFi, aren’t GDPR compliant as they store MAC addresses, or other phone IDs without consent, which count as personal data. This means they can re-identify you when you come back to the store, or another store on their network. While regulation will do a good job at getting rid of these tracking solutions, we want to help by showing retailers there’s an option that gives them more useful data anyway.<p>Daniel and Jaime studied under the same supervisor at the University of Southampton during their computer vision PhDs. They saw plenty of opportunities for using deep learning in people tracking. A key part of Daniel&#x27;s PhD was estimating people&#x27;s demographics from CCTV footage and this led to the end result we are running now. Myself and Daniel went to primary school together, and my background is in APIs and frontends.<p>Thanks for reading! We know the HN community has many people interested and knowledgeable in computer vision and deep learning, so we&#x27;re looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

I let it expire, because a month ago, I decided to downgrade to the Free plan. I downgraded because a month ago, GitHub announced that Free plans would have unlimited private repositories. However, there was a detail I didn&#x27;t catch. On the Free plan, you can have Pages on a public repo, or a private repo without Pages. But you can’t have Pages on a private repo. So what happened when my plan downgraded this morning? My GitHub Pages configurations got quietly deleted. No warning was given. My websites just disappeared. I only learned about it with an alert from Keybase.<p>In the time between my sites getting deleted, and my discovery, a GitHub user by the name of haxorlife created a repository at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;haxorlife&#x2F;iosref.com, named after one of my affected domain names, iosref.com. And they configured iosref.com as the custom domain for that repo. So when I went to my website, I was suddenly faced with &quot;pwned by FA Haxor [!]&quot;.<p>It turns out that GitHub doesn&#x27;t require proof of ownership in order to set a custom domain. (Other services like Gitlab require proof via a TXT DNS record.) Worse yet, if I try to re-add my own domain to my repository, I&#x27;m shown the error: &quot;The CNAME iosref.com is already taken.&quot; And the support page only says: &quot;If you don&#x27;t own the repository that contains the CNAME file with your custom domain, try to contact the owner and ask them to update their custom domain.&quot;<p>There are 65 repositories owned by haxorlife with identical contents, which means that up to 65 domains are affected by this one user. I personally deleted my GitHub-related DNS records for my domain, and later moved my site to DigitalOcean. If you have an affected domain, I urge you to do the same.

This is quite an interesting matter, as to me, much like programming, code reviewing is a highly idiosyncratic, ineffable, thing, and so I wonder whether the community here has somehow managed to formalize it.<p>There are obvious things to put in such a checklist (e.g. short and legible methods, check for potential null reference exceptions) but sometimes even glaring bugs can sneak through code review. A recent example: in a PR, I noticed a method call had been deleted and replaced with nothing, and asked the developer about it. The developer assured me the functionality that the method had provided was implemented elsewhere in the PR, and that indeed seemed to be the case.<p>Turns out, that other implementation did not in fact cover all the functionality the deleted method call had provided, and an entire feature was lost due to that PR. In light of this, something else that could go in a checklist is &quot;when a method call is deleted, verify what the method did&quot;. Another is that deleting that method call meant the method had no references (dead code), yet was not deleted, so neither I nor the other reviewers saw the method body in the diff, which would have shown that a feature was being lost. Another item could be &quot;If method calls are deleted, check for dead code&quot;.<p>Do you have a formal method for conducting code reviews?

Dumb and naive, I know. In those 5 years, it has been one crisis after another, in large part due to my co-founder&#x27;s (CEO) poor management, unethical behavior, and irresponsible spending. Time and time again she has manipulated and exploited her relationships (including ours) to her advantage. She has wantonly spent large sums of company funds on personal activities. The culture she&#x27;s created is more than toxic. Question anything she says, and she&#x27;ll punish you until you&#x27;re gone.

I feel an intense obligation to stay as a co-founder. But I am burnt out, depressed, filled with anxiety, and have become at times suicidal. There&#x27;s not a day that goes by where I don&#x27;t feel as if my co-founder is calculating yet another way to exploit our relationship, or just push me out. I&#x27;ve seen some of the smartest, kindest, and most driven people come through here and ultimately leave, by choice or force, due to their desire to work in an honest and open environment.<p>My biggest fears with leaving: 1) that my co-founder tarnish my reputation with board&#x2F;investors as she has done with past employees, 2) that since founding the company, I have not developed meaningfully given all of the chaos, stress, and crises, resulting in a stunted and unmarketable skillset, and 3) that I have no network to rely on as I moved to SF for this opportunity and have spent the past 5 years here giving my all to this company.<p>I feel stuck, miserable, unmarketable, and it&#x27;s eating at me every day.<p>Any advice you may have would be hugely appreciated.

Considering new famous languages, Go, Rust, Kotlin, Swift, Nim &amp; Crystal, main focus seems to be on static typing &amp; AOT compilation to improve performance. There is a definite push towards adopting functional paradigm mixed with OO, which seems to be a push towards improving accuracy and parallelism. However, there is little groundbreaking in order to increase programmer productivity by a huge margin. (Not discounting the memory safety and other improvements, but they seem incremental.)<p>On the other side, there is a definite shift towards &quot;backendless&quot; applications, where frontend talks directly to the DB, either via autogenerated ReST or GraphQL APIs or via proprietary tools like Cloud Firestore. This is good for MVPs.<p>Frameworks like React &amp; Angular give you decent building blocks to create SPAs, but the learning curve &amp; effort required to create ambitious applications is very high.<p>There is a proliferation of &quot;Low Code&quot; frameworks which allow you to design drag &amp; drop UIs &amp; connect them with APIs. But, it feels like going back to &quot;RAD&quot; tools for the late 90s which led to a lot of spaghetti code. Also, some of these are prohibitively expensive.<p>One noteworthy change is UI design products which are trying to produce the code from UI Mockups. Relatively primitive at this stage. A breakthrough here can definitely be a big productivity booster.<p>Another productivity booster is Cross-Platform frameworks. It&#x27;s already here, tried &amp; tested. We know the trade-offs well. It requires a huge amount of effort to create &amp; maintain a cross-platform framework. Big companies are already tackling this.<p>Considering this background, what do you think will be a breakthrough innovation in programming which will enable programmers to deliver ambitious web&#x2F;mobile apps at a very high speed.","time":1549469996,"title":"Ask HN: What big programming productivity gains you see happening in 5-10 yrs?","type":"story"},{"by":"jccalhoun","descendants":498,"id":19096369,"kids":[19098678,19096705,19098580,19097493,19096813,19099697,19096641,19096929,19097004,19097311,19097861,19096679,19096772,19097803,19102670,19097036,19098872,19097562,19105638,19097730,19096920,19096973,19096996,19099996,19103710,19098601,19096649,19100106,19096584,19100044,19102895,19099070,19097569,19097405,19096552,19102795,19104479,19099880,19103297,19104279,19097831,19098667,19104265,19097863,19097035,19098026,19096754,19098613,19102219,19104728,19102576,19099220,19100128,19099610,19100798,19096723,19097837,19099321,19097767,19098107,19097174,19103901,19097514,19096882],"score":668,"time":1549469782,"title":"What Happened to the 100000 Hour LED Bulbs?","type":"story","url":"https://hackaday.com/2019/02/05/what-happened-to-the-100000-hour-led-bulbs/"},{"by":"headalgorithm","descendants":111,"id":19096358,"kids":[19103479,19103940,19104476,19103717,19103879,19103820,19103852,19103988,19103923,19105153,19103435,19104293,19105417,19108189,19103804,19104188,19104485,19104193,19104866,19104801],"score":245,"time":1549469733,"title":"Human psychology and behavioral studies overlook 85 percent of people","type":"story","url":"https://www.sapiens.org/culture/weird-cultures-human-nature/"},{"by":"mesaframe","descendants":2,"id":19096322,"kids":[19104052,19103536],"score":118,"time":1549469536,"title":"Learn Computer Graphics from Scratch","type":"story","url":"http://www.scratchapixel.com/"},{"by":"techviz","descendants":11,"id":19096308,"kids":[19096548,19096531,19098999,19096718,19097275,19096554,19096631],"score":67,"time":1549469481,"title":"Pandas got 3x faster","type":"story","url":"https://prakhartechviz.blogspot.com/2019/01/faster-pandas-even-on-your-laptop.html"},{"by":"lainon","descendants":23,"id":19096177,"kids":[19100662,19100069,19101986,19099970,19100212],"score":138,"time":1549468874,"title":"Runtime verification in Erlang by using contracts","type":"story","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07937"},{"by":"martin_a","descendants":13,"id":19096171,"kids":[19097429,19096481,19097600,19103568],"score":5,"text":"Hey!\nLooking into establishing a new communication tool for our company.<p>While Slack and Mattermost are great for chats in small teams, it&#x27;s hard to keep up with things, when you&#x27;re a larger team or been out of house for some days or several ideas are discussed in parallel and so on.

I don&#x27;t even have the desire to bring up ideas for work anymore because I don&#x27;t even care if we do them; plus management isn&#x27;t particularly interested in following ideas that don&#x27;t come from their own mouths.

It&#x27;s not hard to see why they want you to do this - basically just like every other application, DLTs require compute, network and <i>lots</i> of storage. Not to forget cross-selling analytics services. But does it really require the biggest cloud providers to misrepresent blockchain tech?<p>R3&#x27;s Corda uses intermediaries called notaries to establish trust and the notary service provides consensus as a pluggable component. Hyperledger&#x27;s orderer service provides consensus as a pluggable component too.<p>Now most business use cases listed with the aforementioned cloud offerings could easily be powered with Crash fault tolerance (CFT) consensus (like Raft) and Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) consensus (like PoW) would be an overkill. And if I&#x27;m only using their cloud offering in a DLT with CFT consensus configuration, I&#x27;d be better off using a more mature distributed database technology instead. So what&#x27;s the point of all this AWS&#x2F;Azure blockchain hoo-ha anyway?<p>Am I missing something here?","time":1549246420,"title":"Ask HN: Why are the cloud providers misrepresenting blockchain technology?","type":"story"},{"by":"breadbox","descendants":41,"id":19073433,"kids":[19073690,19073905,19073633,19073630],"score":128,"time":1549245608,"title":"Is There a Fourth Neutrino Out There in the Universe?","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/is-there-really-a-fourth-neutrino-out-there-in-the-universe-6fa8ff7f1e78"},{"by":"davidlee1435","descendants":6,"id":19073430,"kids":[19074624,19082457,19086829,19079274,19073913,19073808],"score":13,"text":"Hey all, I’m interested in getting good at sales but not making a career out of it.

A 2% increase in comfort and effectiveness over the course of the year would cover pretty much anything on the market.","time":1549143871,"title":"Ask HN: Best headsets for open plan office","type":"story"},{"by":"based2","descendants":7,"id":19065885,"kids":[19078168,19077388,19077032,19077169,19083528],"score":39,"time":1549143378,"title":"PolarPod – Around Antarctica","type":"story","url":"https://www.oceanpolaire.org/en/polar-pod/"},{"by":"Keverw","descendants":119,"id":19065859,"kids":[19066767,19066500,19068151,19067101,19066710,19066802,19066608,19066994,19069049,19067671,19066723,19068859],"score":232,"time":1549143113,"title":"Blackmailers use false copyright claims to shut down victims' YouTube accounts","type":"story","url":"https://boingboing.net/2019/01/30/moderation-at-scale.html"},{"by":"jkuria","descendants":90,"id":19065791,"kids":[19066282,19066872,19066502,19066143,19066669,19066302,19066503,19067688,19066058,19066013,19065995,19066508,19066269,19066012,19067417,19066443,19066707,19066220,19066175,19067080,19067034,19067039,19068905,19066265,19066545,19068149,19066830,19066029,19066423],"score":103,"time":1549142556,"title":"Why Is PayPal So Successful Yet They Treat Merchants Like Crap?","type":"story","url":"https://capitalandgrowth.org/questions/1524/why-is-paypal-so-successful-yet-they-treat-merchan.html"},{"by":"myinnerbanjo","descendants":7,"id":19065722,"kids":[19077036,19077041,19079806,19075025],"score":38,"time":1549141680,"title":"Monitoring Heart Health, One Toilet Seat at a Time","type":"story","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-human-os/biomedical/devices/monitoring-heart-health-one-toilet-seat-at-a-time"},{"by":"mstats","descendants":57,"id":19065814,"kids":[19065849,19065981,19066151,19065924,19066094,19066003,19065989,19066319,19068449,19065892,19071696,19068395,19067457,19066825,19066023],"score":67,"time":1549142755,"title":"Ford's designers are learning to create 3D cars in VR","type":"story","url":"https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ford-virtual-reality-design-gravity-sketch/"},{"by":"pjmlp","descendants":14,"id":19065682,"kids":[19068169,19066889],"score":110,"time":1549141266,"title":"AdaCore Joins the RISC-V Foundation to Provide C and Ada Compilation Support","type":"story","url":"https://www.adacore.com/press/adacore-joins-the-risc-v-foundation"},{"by":"bfoks","descendants":199,"id":19065635,"kids":[19066373,19066075,19065905,19065779,19067582,19065772,19066967,19065935,19066612,19066252,19067554,19066868,19066682,19066000,19066135,19066775,19066753,19066832,19066434,19066624,19066526,19068551,19067177,19067381,19067130,19066158,19067009,19066991,19066818,19066249,19065785],"score":239,"time":1549140702,"title":"I have chosen the wrong flight dates because your date picker is broken","type":"story","url":"https://twitter.com/pugson/status/1091699189166174208"},{"by":"beefman","descendants":67,"id":19065461,"kids":[19065754,19065834,19065951,19068087,19066599,19068069,19065947,19067958,19067721,19066285,19066827,19067062,19066030,19065712],"score":142,"time":1549139035,"title":"China unveils draft law to allow fully foreign-owned enterprises","type":"story","url":"https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/world/china-unveils-draft-law-to-allow-fully-foreign-owned-enterprises/article26129186.ece"},{"by":"saidajigumi","descendants":9,"id":19065256,"kids":[19065689,19065627,19065717,19065696,19065637,19065650],"score":23,"time":1549137190,"title":"Digital exchange loses $137M as founder takes passwords to the grave","type":"story","url":"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/02/digital-exchange-loses-137-million-as-founder-takes-passwords-to-the-grave/"},{"by":"dested","descendants":15,"id":19065236,"kids":[19065813,19065784,19066024,19066877,19066595,19067032,19066063],"score":42,"time":1549137032,"title":"Pattern Matching Custom Data Types in TypeScript","type":"story","url":"https://blog.parametricstudios.com/posts/pattern-matching-custom-data-types/"},{"by":"dsr12","descendants":18,"id":19065116,"kids":[19066467,19067645,19067048,19068216,19066234],"score":37,"time":1549136107,"title":"Digital Media: What Went Wrong","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/business/media/buzzfeed-digital-media-wrong.html"},{"by":"jules-jules","descendants":26,"id":19065063,"kids":[19065516,19065621,19066076,19065441,19065997,19066084,19065988,19065593],"score":20,"time":1549135590,"title":"The N.Y.

By chance, I happened to notice that my vultr server, <i>and many new ones deployed solely to test this</i>, resolve non-existent domains <i>as long as the hostname and label end in some TLD</i> (tested .com, .net and .org).  This issue does <i>not</i> happen for dotless or blank hostnames.<p>For instance:<p><pre><code>    $ ping sjdisdji.net\n    PING sjdisdji.net.net (34.250.90.28): 56 data bytes\n    $ ping doasidjaoidja8dy78y7ahduh.org\n    PING doasidjaoidja8dy78y7ahduh.org.net (23.23.86.44): 56 data bytes\n</code></pre>\nThe seemingly random resolution also happens with some CC TLDs, such as uk, fr, ar. Depending on the server it may or may not resolve .com or .org. It happens at least with OpenBSD 6.4, Ubuntu 18.10, and at least choosing London or Amsterdam.<p>I reported this (OTH-21BCZ) and was pretty disappointed with their response. First they asked me whether the issue persisted upon changing `&#x2F;etc&#x2F;reolv.conf` to<p><pre><code>    nameserver 8.8.8.8\n    nameserver 8.8.4.4\n </code></pre>\nIt did, and their conclusion was that &quot;This is an issue with software running on your instance and not the infrastructure. I have been unable to reproduce this issue on my end on my own instances.&quot; Just to be clear, I tried this all on brand new deploys, with <i>nothing</i> on them, so I can&#x27;t conceive how this could be &quot;an issue with software running on my instance&quot;...<p>Can you guys check if you see the same thing?

I have an opportunity for a booking website and I am unsure how much I should charge. Here are some details of the app without giving anything important away:<p>The app needs to have a fully functional booking system, reviews, payments and monthly subscriptions, user dashboards and abilities to change settings, optimized for conversions &amp; event tracking.<p>The design is already done, so I would need to only build the back-end and copy the designs that they already have. This app would be built from scratch using a custom framework (Flask).<p>I expect this app to take around 200-250 hours to complete at my current skill level. The thing is, I am a relatively new developer and my portfolio isn&#x27;t very big. I know I can build this app as I&#x27;ve done similar projects in the past, but they are taking a risk with a new developer. I assume that has to be factored into the price.<p>This would be a complete app built from scratch, only being aided by the designs and layouts already made.<p>I have $30&#x2F;hr in my head. People have told me for an app of this caliber, that is way too low. Is it?

A couple of days ago she received a vaccination at school from agents of Unicef, a tetanus vaccine supposedly. The vaccine was only administered to females aged 15 and higher. Her school is not the first one, tens of thousands of young women are receiving these shots for reasons unclear. I am not suggesting that there is anything wrong, but it&#x27;s really curious to me that a tetanus vaccine would only benefit women? These shots are being administered without any parental consent to teenagers without any explanations. This is clearly wrong and shocking. This makes me realize that due process is only relevant for these NGOs if you live in countries where citizens are properly represented.<p>I am writing this to try and see if anyone here has a good understanding of tetanus and could help understand. Why would a tetanus shot be only administered to young women?<p>I have always been myself an advocate for vaccination and know for a fact that most conspiracy theories are just that, theories.

We help open-source maintainers make money. Think of us as agents for open-source maintainers.<p>We met last year through the Indie Hackers community. It’s one of the luckiest things that’s ever happened to us. We clicked immediately. It became clear we share an obsession with building things to make developers’ lives easier. We began working on small developer-centric projects together.<p>We started DevFlight after recognizing maintainers are the most underserved developers. They provide immense value and get little in return. We’ve spoken with many maintainers who’ve told us the current open-source development model is unsustainable for them. Their projects often end up being a second full-time job without pay. Some have to stop supporting their projects altogether due to a lack of resources.<p>It’s time to start paying maintainers well for their work. Making open-source development sustainable will benefit everyone in the long-term. Our vision is to make it possible for maintainers to receive a stable income that accurately reflects the value they bring to companies. We’re accomplishing this by connecting maintainers with companies who will pay them.<p>If you’re a maintainer, apply now on our website to join the waitlist. We’re currently working with a small group of maintainers from popular projects. We’ll gradually expand this group. Shoot us an email to learn more. We’d love to chat with you.<p>We aim to make the process of hiring maintainers dead simple for companies. We communicate when maintainers are available and what types of work they can provide. If your company is interested in learning more, please reach out to us.<p>Companies are paying for things like priority email and on-demand support from maintainers, feature request prioritization, continued development of the project, faster bug fixes, and guaranteed project stability. This is not an exhaustive list.<p>We take 10% from every contract we negotiate. We’re aware the contract model doesn’t work for everyone. We’re exploring other revenue models based on what’s best for our maintainer network. We’d be particularly interested in hearing any ideas about this from the HN community.<p>This is a difficult problem to solve, because it’s fundamentally more of a human problem than a software one. Companies often aren’t aware of all the open-source software they’re dependent on. Many also have complex purchasing requirements and no clear understanding of how their company can directly benefit from paying maintainers.

We are a small human rights organisation that specialises in working with high risk non-profit, NGO, activists, media etc all over the world. Ranging from small community groups in the US to large well-known international organisations and to lone individuals protecting rainforests. We work to protect a few dozen groups and hundreds of individuals every year all over the world.<p>As you are well aware, such organisations are often targets for very sophisticated spear-phishing, malware attacks, APTs from countries like China etc. Unfortunately most are woefully under resourced and lack the ability to have basic monitoring systems (and most importantly, someone looking at them) in place. So often we can find the same basic attacks repeating themselves even when IOCs etc are available to block them.<p>We are currently experimenting with building a small virtual SOC across a number of at-risk activist, media, human rights and environmental organisations (from activists in Zimbabwe to rainforest defenders in Brazil) to help them pool their resources and manage security in a more effective way. So tools like CB, Falcon etc. Obviously it&#x27;s highly expensive stuff so we want to do our best to make sure it is available to people doing good work on the ground in a lot of high risk places.<p>Also, if anyone is interested in maybe helping out with some advice (experiences&#x2F;positive&#x2F;negative) about using&#x2F;setting these tools up, running or being part of SOC, the people we are working with a pretty inspiring and your knowledge would go a long way to help protect them in troubled times!<p>Feel free to reach out to vsoc AT secfirst.org<p>Thanks!","time":1548864759,"title":"Ask HN: Building a virtual SOC for non-profits, activists who wants to help?","type":"story"},{"by":"jbegley","descendants":100,"id":19036262,"kids":[19037267,19037197,19036791,19036628,19037451,19037166,19037926,19036593,19039863,19037615,19038347,19037005],"score":199,"time":1548864696,"title":"Prisons Are Quietly Building Databases of Incarcerated People’s Voice Prints","type":"story","url":"https://theintercept.com/2019/01/30/prison-voice-prints-databases-securus/"},{"by":"signa11","descendants":26,"id":19036106,"kids":[19038135,19040443,19038949,19038598],"score":81,"time":1548863857,"title":"On Concurrency in Go HTTP Servers","type":"story","url":"https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2019/on-concurrency-in-go-http-servers/"},{"by":"edhelas","descendants":2,"id":19035843,"kids":[19039399,19035913,19035881],"score":7,"time":1548862428,"title":"The browser version of Skype drops Firefox support","type":"story","url":"https://preview.web.skype.com/"},{"by":"epaga","descendants":310,"id":19035834,"kids":[19036004,19036377,19036467,19036022,19036204,19036025,19036413,19036443,19037281,19035938,19035931,19035955,19036092,19037126,19037715,19036749,19036638,19038455,19037719,19037151,19037092,19042366,19036703,19036342,19046107,19036971,19037524,19037923,19039158,19036767,19038407,19038491,19043154,19038666,19035896,19038587,19036360,19037592,19036198,19036195,19036096,19037971,19035925,19036273],"score":735,"time":1548862360,"title":"Apple blocks Facebook from running its internal iOS apps","type":"story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/30/18203551/apple-facebook-blocked-internal-ios-apps"},{"by":"LinuxBender","descendants":51,"id":19035765,"kids":[19037887,19036548,19037047,19036561,19037516,19036993,19037532,19036870,19037394,19036938],"score":126,"time":1548861953,"title":"'Metallic wood' has the strength of titanium and the density of water","type":"story","url":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190128125314.htm"},{"by":"oefrha","descendants":4,"id":19035777,"kids":[19035951,19036847],"score":2,"text":"This post is mainly targeted at HN readers who are good at programming but are not professional software engineers, with a focus on academics and aspiring academics.

Scribe 1.0 provided sales call scheduling service managing client’s sales inboxes, scheduling sales calls and updating their CRM based on email and calendar events. We did this through a human in the loop (software+service) approach. In the process of managing external conversations we built an internal SAAS product which helped us stay on top of all the email and CRM updates. We are opening it up today for others to use as a standalone product calling it Scribe 2.0<p>It’s an extensively customizable workflow builder which allows you to receive events from your email, calendar, salesforce and Stripe accounts either as Slack DMs or notifications in slack channels of your choice. You can configure any number of API actions on top of these events and based on the event contents decide what actions to take with couple of clicks right from slack. We also have a HTTP&#x2F;webhook option to support custom events or events from other integrations as we explore expanding the workflow builder for more usecases.<p>Some of the sample usecases we have been used for include<p>- Share selective emails in slack and based on the email information, you can reply, send a calendar invite and update CRM with single click buttons without opening any other website.<p>- You can setup custom reply templates for different email categories, and have them personalized based on the incoming email information<p>- Create support tickets, add assignees and deadlines, from email in slack<p>- Trigger ML jobs with updated parameters based on previous job’s success&#x2F;failure and performance accuracy.<p>- Trigger code deployments and task pipelines from Slack<p>In effect, users can configure workflows to send data from any of their SAAS apps to Slack, update it in real time, and send it back to anywhere else. And all this can be done collaboratively allowing for broad visibility and accountability across teams. We also have a cool gif feature that allows one to attach changing gifs based on incoming event data allowing for some nice surprises<p>Some of the interesting feedback we have received from our customers are<p>- They go without logging into gmail and salesforce for days<p>- We are like a mother who nudges them to do the right thing at the right time<p>Technically, we have built a unified layer for authentication, resource and crud schema inference. We can therefore integrate with any software that is openApi compliant in a matter of few days. Pubsub management however has been quite nasty given the scale, lack of api standardization and the asynchronous nature of the platform. We also have selectively exposed our email AI from the original Scribe 1.0 product, that categorizes sales email into more than 22 different categories allowing users to setup personalized templates and actions based on the intent of the email.<p>We are looking to HN to get feedback on the product as well as explore new usecases on how we can extend the service to cover more integrations and usecases. Given our history, we have mostly built with sales usecase in mind, but we do believe that now, this can be extended perhaps more effectively to other markets and would love to get HN’s thoughts. Apart from more integrations, we can also provide option to schedule time based notifications as well as ability to define slack commands to pull data&#x2F;trigger workflows if there is a usecase&#x2F;market need.","time":1548785202,"title":"Launch HN: Scribe 2.0 (YC W17) – Configurable, Actionable Alerts on Slack","type":"story"},{"by":"NelsonMinar","descendants":6,"id":19028346,"kids":[19034759,19037055,19034627,19034555,19037065,19037825],"score":57,"time":1548784489,"title":"Inside the Apollo Guidance Computer's Core Memory","type":"story","url":"http://www.righto.com/2019/01/inside-apollo-guidance-computers-core.html"},{"by":"tombert","descendants":5,"id":19028201,"kids":[19028410,19045796,19032138,19028454],"score":10,"text":"I have been working on a personal project for awhile now, and think that I could potentially monetize it in the nearish future.<p>However, the product could (arguably) be considered a competitive product with something my employer offers, and I since I signed a non-compete with my employer I fear that there could be legal retaliation against me if I were to try and do anything with my project.<p>My project only &quot;competes&quot; in an abstract sense, and a part of me feels like if I were to disclose my project, I&#x27;d be told I couldn&#x27;t monetize it, but also couldn&#x27;t keep working on it for fun.<p>Has anyone here ever had any similar situations?
