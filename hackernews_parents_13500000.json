Instruction sequences are represented by statements, and the state space by variables.<p>&gt;I consider object-oriented languages also as procedural. They emphasize the grouping of related data into objects, and the attachment of methods to objects. The close relationship between object-oriented and procedural views becomes apparent if we relate the respective terminologies: Basically the terms class, object, and method stand for the classical type, variable, and procedure. Instead of calling a procedure, we now send a message.<p>Do you agree with Wirth&#x27;s belief that OOP is essentially procedural, but dressed up in new terminology?<p>If you program in an OOP

Treated like an object, so I never felt real, did not develop a sense of agency like most people.  Which led to me not knowing what to do most of life.  In college I said fuck it, went into a major that I knew paid money, but that I had no real care for.<p>Long story short, I am 34, I have saved ~2 million in the bank.  Recently to change my life, I moved to NYC to try to force myself to take action (I left my original job of 8.5 years to start a new life). I have an engineering degree, but it&#x27;s not CS (and not from an Ivy).<p>I have not worked in 3 years. I spent a lot of this time reading all of the entrepreneur material out there, fixing my psychological issues (mostly cognitive distortions due to faulty &#x27;programming&#x27; from early life- midbrain stuff).  And unfortunately I also did quite a bit of hardcore gaming (mostly due to hopelessness&#x2F;depression).  I pushed myself to top 10 on wow and hearthstone, and I considered streaming, but I knew that long term, I wouldn&#x27;t be intellectually satisfied with just doing that.<p>Since I seem to share values with a lot of the tech community and founders, I thought I should teach myself programming and start a business in that field, but there are so many directions to go, it doesn&#x27;t seem practical to learn them all.  Do you learn JS, do you learn mobile, should I try to become as good as an engineer that works for GOOG etc...  Should I just say fuck it and become a physicist or quant and go into finance.  I don&#x27;t know, but I need to take action, and for some reason I cannot decide. I think part of it is also facing the humiliation of working with much younger people and them looking at me like &#x27;holy shit, I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m not that guy&#x27;.","time":1490311170,"title":"Ask HN: I'm in a humiliating situation, and I can't commit","type":"story"},{"by":"alanfranzoni","descendants":4,"id":13945088,"kids":[13946998,13947592,13949974,13946891],"score":33,"time":1490309705,"title":"Chrome 57 distrusts most StartSSL certificates","type":"story","url":"http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/archive/2605051"},{"by":"ogezi","descendants":1,"id":13945030,"kids":[13946575,13945898],"score":10,"time":1490309043,"title":"Ruport Murdoch sold $125M in Theranos stock for just $1","type":"story","url":"http://www.businessinsider.com/rupert-murdoch-sells-theranos-stake-2017-3"},{"by":"ohjeez","descendants":43,"id":13945010,"kids":[13945525,13945558,13945582,13945875,13945476,13946411,13946295,13945884,13946222],"score":62,"time":1490308925,"title":"Remember Zip Disks?

I once spent 6 months with the slowest computer, and gave up trying to change because there was no clear way for me to request a repair &#x2F; new one.<p>We&#x27;ve developed a Slack app, an iPad app and a web app to make the request process for employees easy and fast.<p>You can use Hivy to make orders (snacks, supplies, perks, business travel) and suggestions to improve your life at the office. Office management teams review these orders, manage them and collaborate on Hivy to keep employees happy and productive.<p>We&#x27;re really excited about what we are building and would love you and your Office Manager to try it out.

What do you all think?<p>1. Allow readers to pay authors directly<p>At the bottom of each article, readers can donate&#x2F;pay the author to support their content writing. Two benefits here - content writers are incentivized to create great content frequently, and readers get more content. This creates a direct connection between content authors &amp; readers, and builds on top of the network of freelance writing that already exists out there. The publisher, like Medium, would incur revenue via service fees. This currently exists on Medium for publishers, but it should exist for all authors.<p>2. Sell consulting services via expertise gathered from the content and content authors<p>The most valuable data in media companies like the NY Times isn&#x27;t the articles, but the authors themselves. Many niche journalists have extraordinary expertise and connections in certain industries - such as food, fashion, and so forth. Leveraging their expertise and building a consulting business on top of it would be mutually beneficial. The content naturally promotes the consulting business, and the consulting business validates the content.

Up until January Calibre has been an &quot;inbetween other things&quot; &#x2F; evenings &#x2F; holidays kind of project. (Only, oops—I did that for four years.). Last year I knuckled down to get into the position where I could work on it full time.<p>I&#x27;ve spent the last 8 weeks working on &quot;Test profiles&quot; (The launch post is here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;get-calibre&#x2F;announcing-test-profiles-and-budgets-2-0-84667a4e4749\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;get-calibre&#x2F;announcing-test-profiles-and-...</a>) — It allows you to emulate hardware devices (cpu speed, user-agents and screen dimensions), as well as limit the bandwidth (latency, download and upload speeds), and set cookies (you could use this to log into your app, test a staff-shipped feature, or maybe turn off advertising and see the performance impact.) I think I&#x27;ve finally got the basis of a really powerful tool, and I&#x27;m keen to share it with… everyone! I do everything myself, so if you&#x27;ve any questions, I&#x27;m here to answer them!","time":1490228762,"title":"Show HN: Calibre Test Profiles – Test your sites under real world conditions","type":"story","url":"https://calibreapp.com"},{"by":"prostoalex","descendants":3,"id":13936367,"kids":[13941464,13943388,13948121],"score":52,"time":1490227945,"title":"Children in Fresno have three times the rate of lead poisoning as in Flint","type":"story","url":"https://qz.com/939910/children-in-fresno-california-have-three-times-the-rate-of-lead-poisoning-as-in-flint/"},{"by":"jseliger","descendants":73,"id":13936252,"kids":[13939499,13938784,13938413,13938479,13938943,13937938,13938655,13937669,13939672,13939446,13938830,13937700,13937181,13937957,13938371],"score":52,"time":1490226911,"title":"Boom Supersonic raises $33M to build the fastest airplane for passenger flight","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/22/boom-supersonic-raises-33m-to-build-the-fastest-airplane-for-passenger-flight/"},{"by":"joowani","descendants":3,"id":13936237,"kids":[13937056,13937677,13942499],"score":8,"time":1490226773,"title":"Show HN: Directory Tags for Lazy Programmers","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/joowani/dtags"},{"by":"13of40","descendants":109,"id":13936214,"kids":[13936397,13939738,13936361,13938666,13937749,13936701,13938388,13937130,13937790,13939398,13936339,13939649,13937461,13938995,13936821,13936961,13936873,13937040,13937306,13936946,13936904],"score":142,"time":1490226536,"title":"AT&T, other U.S. advertisers quit Google, YouTube over extremist videos","type":"story","url":"http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/03/22/att-pulls-google-youtube-ads-over-offensive-content/99497194/"},{"by":"fratlas","descendants":6,"id":13936211,"kids":[13937185,13937233,13941607],"score":6,"text":"I&#x27;m trying stripe, but I&#x27;d love to have a service which has their own checkout, and can provide an API where I can detract credit-like usage from a users account etc.","time":1490226524,"title":"Ask HN: Best SaaS for handling billing (subscription)?","type":"story"},{"by":"feelix","descendants":9,"id":13936197,"kids":[13936535,13936327,13937132,13936570],"score":4,"time":1490226410,"title":"Faster memory comparison in C","type":"story","url":"https://macosxfilerecovery.com/faster-memory-comparison-in-c/"},{"by":"gerosan","descendants":147,"id":13936153,"kids":[13936336,13936619,13936682,13936696,13936354,13936330,13936293,13937388,13936556,13936595,13936700,13936569,13937024,13940520,13936342,13937105,13936343,13943926,13937228,13942933,13936416,13940344,13936302,13936377,13936611,13936602],"score":499,"time":1490226084,"title":"Apple has acquired Workflow, an automation tool for iPad and iPhone","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/22/apple-has-acquired-workflow-a-powerful-automation-tool-for-ipad-and-iphone/"},{"by":"trainiac","descendants":10,"id":13936095,"kids":[13936451,13936546,13936137,13941831],"score":14,"text":"In order to validate my startup idea, I want to see if people are willing to pay for the product&#x2F;service (thus, I want to accept payments).

I’m Kalle, one of the founders at Sudden Coffee (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.suddencoffee.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.suddencoffee.com</a>). We make instant coffee and sell it through our website as a subscription.<p>I started working on this almost two years ago after my cafe business failed. I was frustrated by how unscalable and inconsistent selling good coffee is.<p>In 2015 I placed 9th in the World Barista Champs in Seattle. On the flight back to Helsinki I was desperate for caffeine and ordered a coffee which was horrendous. I started wondering what would be a better way than Aeropress + hand grinder combo to have great coffee on the go.<p>Instant coffee is liquid coffee that’s been dehydrated. It’s normally made with the worst beans that are roasted really dark and extracted up to 6 times at temperatures up to 180C and 15 bar pressure. As a result, they can reach 60% extraction yield. Next, the liquid is boiled down and finally dehydrated by spray drying it with hot air. This process results in the gnarly bitter, woody, rubbery instant we all know.<p>We start with good beans: currently from a co-op called Biftu Gudina in Ethiopia, roasted by 49th Parallel in Vancouver, BC. In the beginning we brewed the coffee by hand as espresso — I would literally spend 12 hours per day pulling shots. At one point we had a full-time person doing this.<p>Eventually, we developed our own fully-closed centrifugal brewing system that doesn’t allow for any aroma to escape. We extract the coffee at low temperatures (85-90C) to 21-23% extraction yield. As a result, we only get the good stuff — sweetness, fruitiness, acidity — and none of the bad stuff.<p>Also, we’ve developed our own freeze-drying technique that’s kind of equivalent to a server farm. Instead of having one enormous machine we have a bunch of small freeze dryers. This allows for greater control and shorter iteration cycle.<p>This might be too long already so I&#x27;ll stop here.

Somebody on this earth knows why yet it&#x27;s never been disclosed (or I cannot find it in the piles of &quot;reset your NVRAM&quot; posts on the internet).<p>The follow types of things fail with regularity:<p>- Awake from sleep and connect to previous wifi connection (also wifi stops working and has to be restarted)<p>- Backup iPhone to iCloud<p>- Sign into iCloud on macOS or iOS<p>- Sign into Message on macOS<p>- Sign into Facetime on macOS<p>- Make a Facetime call from macOS (why is call disabled?)<p>- Backup iPhone to macOS over wifi (never got it to work)<p>- Backup iPhone to macOS over USB (loves to fail during backup)<p>- Backups iPhone photos to Photos app (phone disconnects during backup)<p>etc<p>I&#x27;m amazed at the problems Apple seems to have writing stable code for a very limited set of hardware.","time":1490212806,"title":"Ask HN: Can an insider explain why Apple's networking/connectivity is so poor?","type":"story"},{"by":"wallflower","descendants":1,"id":13934175,"kids":[13941591,13934239],"score":1,"time":1490212166,"title":"A Patent Case That Affects Everyone","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-03-21/a-patent-case-that-affects-everyone"},{"by":"sloanesturz","descendants":60,"id":13934107,"kids":[13934472,13935094,13934710,13935159,13934392,13936435,13935526,13934812,13934678,13938223,13937341,13934641],"score":50,"time":1490211762,"title":"Instagram grows to 1M active advertisers","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/22/instagram-grows-to-1m-active-advertisers-plans-to-add-more-data-and-direct-booking/"},{"by":"arunc","descendants":9,"id":13933827,"kids":[13935359,13937023],"score":38,"time":1490210123,"title":"IntelliJ IDEA 2017.1","type":"story","url":"https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/whatsnew/"},{"by":"DiabloD3","descendants":2,"id":13933746,"kids":[13936402,13939159],"score":15,"time":1490209646,"title":"The New Laptop Ban Adds to Travelers' Lack of Privacy and Security","type":"story","url":"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/new-laptop-ban-adds-travelers-lack-privacy-and-security"},{"by":"dreampeppers99","descendants":4,"id":13933656,"kids":[13933779,13935258,13934173,13933682],"score":26,"time":1490208915,"title":"A hands-on introduction to digital video technology","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/leandromoreira/digital_video_introduction"},{"by":"johns","descendants":2,"id":13933611,"kids":[13933626,13934024],"score":6,"time":1490208643,"title":"Segment Open Fellowship 2017","type":"story","url":"https://segment.com/blog/segment-open-fellowship-2017/"},{"by":"anaptfox","descendants":137,"id":13933550,"kids":[13935820,13933729,13938000,13935834,13936034,13935771,13935783,13936106,13936192,13937355,13936194,13934969,13936304,13936292,13936199,13938711,13938401,13940267,13936418,13936325,13936965,13937072,13938997,13938147,13936410,13936352,13935837,13937574,13937740,13939457,13937895,13937245,13937131,13938334,13937899,13936733,13936229,13935587,13938439],"score":189,"time":1490208301,"title":"Medium releases Memberships","type":"story","url":"https://blog.medium.com/upgrade-your-medium-924b74c36552"},{"by":"astoellis","dead":true,"id":13933365,"kids":[13933753,13933781,13933786,13933757,13933759],"score":9,"time":1490206978,"title":"Early Warning Signs of the Impending Market Crash","type":"story","url":"https://humanizing.tech/early-warning-signs-of-the-impending-market-crash-6a4e065d63e3#.hcn1p4qzg"},{"by":"MiaDavis","descendants":3,"id":13933363,"kids":[13937486,13933512],"score":2,"text":"I have recently discovered a really beautiful and brilliantly designed SaaS app that I am now using every day.

There seem to be <i>tons</i> of remote-only job postings in this vein.<p>But I don&#x27;t understand how it&#x27;s legal - aren&#x27;t these people being treated as employees, which come with an impossible amount of risk &#x2F; international law &#x2F; messiness attached?<p>Is there perhaps a whitelisted set of countries that have extremely simple employee &#x2F; contractor rules?<p>My worst nightmare is ending up in court for accidentally crossing some line that I didn&#x27;t understand. I just want to hire someone and start building an awesome remote team!","time":1490034221,"title":"Ask HN: How do I legally build a remote dev team?","type":"story"},{"by":"winkv","descendants":8,"id":13916349,"kids":[13918525,13930673,13916420,13916407],"score":7,"text":"Non US developers how do you charge money for your side project (saas&#x2F;app&#x2F;web) without creating a company.","time":1490033692,"title":"Ask HN: How do you take money for side project without forming a company","type":"story"},{"by":"M_Grey","descendants":154,"id":13916255,"kids":[13917839,13916491,13917208,13917013,13917665,13917505,13916964,13917500,13918539,13917122,13917958,13917035,13923526,13916675,13920471,13916810,13917106,13917583,13917376,13916786],"score":170,"time":1490032861,"title":"Has Li-battery genius John Goodenough done it again?

However, the overwhelming majority of data science jobs are a rebranding of business analytics, ad analytics, etc., and are for companies with questionable societal benefit. \nMy question is this: if I’m looking to do “data science” type work (statistics&#x2F;ML&#x2F;experimental design&#x2F;recommender systems), and want to either personally work on something meaningful or want to work for a company doing something meaningful, where should I go?<p>Are any HN’ers working on something they feel is genuinely making the world better, and looking for a data scientist? If so, what are you working on, and where are you located?<p>I’m open to suggestions of both specific jobs and general career avenues. Public policy seems like an interesting research area (I’ve worked w&#x2F; economists &amp; quantitative sociologists on related topics and enjoyed the work), but I’m not sure whether there are any financially sustainable (non-RA) jobs available in that space for someone with just a masters degree. I’m interested in personalized medicine and medical trial design from an academic research perspective, but I’m not sure who operates in that space or whether a MS would be sufficient long-term.<p>Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!","time":1489957895,"title":"Ask HN: Meaningful Data Science Jobs","type":"story"},{"by":"s-stude","descendants":2,"id":13909675,"kids":[13910607,13910552],"score":1,"text":"Hello, hackernews-ers.<p>I&#x27;m interested in a feedback for a geolocation based pricing strategy for an online e-commerce application.

I particularly dislike my current job and have been contemplating leaving for a while. I started trying to work on a portfolio while learning new stuff so I could try freelancing instead of another full time job, but I really just don’t feel like programming outside of work anymore.<p>I want to just quit when my stocks vest in a few months and take a real break - traveling, learning a new (non-programming) language, seeing family and friends, getting back into my hobbies, and reflecting on what I really want to do in life. I’ll be turning 27 soon, have enough savings to last a few years, no debts, and no family&#x2F;dependents. It seems like this might be the last time I can take a risk like this before I have any real responsibilities to worry about. After a nice long summer vacation my plan is to work on my skills&#x2F;portfolio for a year or two and try to get enough freelancing work so that I don’t need to get another job. I figure I can always start interviewing again if my funds start running low, but I’m also not above driving for Uber or something if I need more money&#x2F;time to get something going. Maybe I’ll decide I don’t even want to be a developer anymore and do something else entirely.<p>The few people I’ve told about this plan have been supportive and think its reasonable. I’m mostly really excited about it too, but sometimes I can’t help but think I’m about to make the dumbest decision ever.

Our relationship is awesome, and we get along great. While we are all excited about the business, we are concerned about the risks that money can introduce to a relationship. The biggest risk being we don&#x27;t want anyone to harbor resentment toward someone else for varying levels of effort towards the business.  Currently we are both equal share partners and the initiation of the business.<p>We discussed various solutions to this. One was to track  hourly contributions towards the business, and divvy up the proceeds based off level of effort at the end of the fiscal year.  The challenge with this approach is that some contributions are more significant than others. You could argue that developing a social media campaign over two hours would be significantly more valuable than cleaning the shop over four hours as an example. Therefore if we were to go this path, we would need to assign some weighting to each activity and it seems to get overly complex very quickly.<p>Another was to create a RACI  chart, mapping out all the core functions of the business, and indicating who would be responsible, and accountable for each major action. The RACI chart  would not dictate an allocation of money based on the level of effort, but would aim to hold those accountable for equal contributions to the business.<p>Neither one of these ideas seem great to me, and so I&#x27;m curious what other thoughts people have. The two examples above our mechanisms to comanage the business, our intent is to develop the most appropriate mechanism and codify it in an operating agreement that would be binding.<p>Thanks","time":1489754877,"title":"Ask HN: Starting a business with family, how do I protect our relationship?","type":"story"},{"by":"happy-go-lucky","descendants":72,"id":13893440,"kids":[13893693,13893724,13893730,13893681,13893771,13893636,13893675,13894000,13893802,13893635],"score":24,"time":1489754054,"title":"House OKs Bill Allowing 'Mentally Incapacitated' Veterans to Buy Guns","type":"story","url":"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/03/17/520510426/house-oks-bill-allowing-mentally-incapacitated-veterans-to-buy-guns"},{"by":"rcymerys","descendants":12,"id":13893290,"kids":[13897961,13897546,13898012,13898133,13898161,13898995],"score":63,"time":1489752193,"title":"I Automated My Friends and Nobody Could Tell the Difference","type":"story","url":"https://latenightcoding.co/i-automated-my-friends/"},{"by":"jbergstroem","descendants":57,"id":13893251,"kids":[13898737,13898629,13899377,13898510,13899373,13898601,13893314,13898961,13899434,13898749,13899766,13899340],"score":184,"time":1489751644,"title":"The BSD family tree","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/master/share/misc/bsd-family-tree"},{"by":"b01t","descendants":3,"id":13893368,"kids":[13893454,13893458,13894096],"score":3,"time":1489753057,"title":"Ask HN: What are some innovative ideas for improving democracy?","type":"story"},{"by":"mcbetz","descendants":4,"id":13893705,"kids":[13894022,13893761,13893846],"score":2,"text":"Let&#x27;s say you would give a TED talk about how the modern web and modern web applications work.

I&#x27;ve worked in telecom. I&#x27;ve consulted for the federal government. I&#x27;ve slung code for startups. For a few years I was even the lead developer for Squidoo.com. These days I&#x27;m self-employed—it&#x27;s a means to an end, and I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m almost at the end.<p>But before I move onto the next waypoint in my current career, I&#x27;m considering testing a fork.<p>When I reflect on my career, I realize I&#x27;ve done as much if not more listening than I have done coding. I&#x27;m not talking about the sort of listening that&#x27;s necessary to write good software. I&#x27;m talking about helping my colleagues to resolve personal and professional conflicts. Sometimes I&#x27;ve helped by saying nothing at all—I&#x27;m good at listening.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a marketplace among my peers for a &quot;professional listener.&quot; We could discuss personal and professional challenges together. You&#x27;d pay up front for an hour of my time. We&#x27;d sign a mutual NDA. I would add you to my Slack Team, and we&#x27;d setup a time to chat.<p>I want to be clear: I&#x27;m not proposing counseling; I&#x27;m pretty sure that would be against the law. I couldn&#x27;t make recommendations for treatment of any sort. I suspect from time to time I would recommend licensed practicing counselors.<p>No, this would be more like life coaching, but I don&#x27;t want to call it that. There&#x27;s too much voodoo in that market, too many &quot;weird tricks.&quot; This would be honest, patient, professional listening—no shortcuts, just kindness.<p>Would you use such a service?

You always have been. You always will be. Even if you aren&#x27;t actively playing games at this time. I&#x27;m part of the generation that went outside and played until it got dark.<p>But then I&#x27;m also part of the generation that had Atari. Then Nintendo. Gameboy was awesome too. And even a Sega Genesis system. And beyond. Computers came along, amazing as they were, offering some game called Doom that you had to load from DOS. Duke Nukem. Wolfenstein 3d. Quake was another. As the years progressed, so did the games. And I spent my teenage years in the gaming world. MMOPRGs. Specifcally, Subspace (now known as Continuum) and Asheron&#x27;s Call (discontinued in 2017), if any of you were lucky enough to play.<p>As I got older, however, getting jobs, going off to college, I played games less and less, hoping that someday, maybe I would find the time to play them again. Between work and side projects and life, the prospect of gaming again just seems unlikely at this time. I think about it.. I even buy games from SteamPowered, usually when they are on sale, hoping to play them, but I never really get a chance, and if I do, it might be that I took a day or two just to try them out, before getting back into programming.<p>I keep returning back to my side projects and programming because it makes me feel productive. When I&#x27;m not coding, I feel like I&#x27;m wasting time not doing &quot;what I need to do&quot;. The guilt builds up inside me which prevents me from gaming and I know I need to stick to coding. I feel that if I am going to be successful, whether it just be creating a few popular web apps, starting a business, or generating some recurring income, that I have to keep programming.<p>So for

We’re the founders of the Centre for Effective Altruism, a nonprofit from Oxford, UK in the YC W17 batch. We’re the creators of Effective Altruism (EA) Funds, (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.effectivealtruism.org&#x2F;funds&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.effectivealtruism.org&#x2F;funds&#x2F;</a>) high-impact, individual giving portfolios, managed by expert researchers. It&#x27;s like Vanguard for charity.<p>We created EA Funds because we became frustrated with how difficult it was to find the best giving opportunities as an individual donor. Using EA Funds, you choose a problem area, and our fund managers find the best giving opportunities. Our initial funds are all managed by Program Officers at the Open Philanthropy Project, a $10B private foundation. In the future, we hope to expand the number of funds, building a competitive marketplace for giving, where the amount of funding a charity receives is directly correlated with the amount of good they do.<p>We started out 7 years ago, when 23 of our friends pledged to give 10% of their income to the most effective charities they could find. Since then, 2700 people have joined us, donating $33M, including $17M last year. We’ve found that some of the most cost-effective charities can buy one year of perfect health (a DALY) for as little as $80, while others have no effect. A study in the US found that $10B was spent each year on social programs that had been proven to have no effect on outcomes, and a further $1B was spent on programs that were actively harmful. We built EA Funds to replicate the success of groups like the Gates Foundation and GiveWell. By pooling our resources and utilising the expertise of our research community, we can give individual donors the same impact per dollar as billion dollar foundations.<p>We’d love to hear your feedback and answer questions about effective altruism, donating effectively or hear your stories about the charity sector!<p>(Edit: originally said QALY instead of DALY, but that was a typo, as commenters pointed out.)","time":1489683350,"title":"Launch HN: Effective Altruism Funds (YC W17 Nonprofit)","type":"story"},{"by":"chambaz","descendants":2,"id":13886565,"kids":[13886753,13886816],"score":8,"time":1489683172,"title":"Show HN: Universally rendered JavaScript app in one line of bash","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/chambaz/single-line-js-app"},{"by":"kevintb","descendants":14,"id":13886545,"kids":[13888874,13886971,13886842,13888839,13890589,13888912,13890330,13888505,13888535,13887581,13898533],"score":19,"time":1489683083,"title":"What are the biggest engineering mistakes that a tech company has made?","type":"story"},{"by":"parthchoudhary","descendants":12,"id":13886487,"kids":[13897941,13893465,13887017,13888384,13886635,13887165],"score":22,"time":1489682704,"title":"Show HN: Online CV/Resume Maker in React Using Facebook's Draft-Js","type":"story","url":"http://rewritecv.com/create-free-cv-online/"},{"by":"doener","descendants":2,"id":13886367,"kids":[13886719,13886622],"score":12,"time":1489681871,"title":"The Trello Aquisition – The Missing Piece of the Puzzle","type":"story","url":"https://thenextweb.com/contributors/missing-piece-of-the-trello-aquisition/#.tnw_YtiD8MvD"},{"by":"diogomartf","descendants":13,"id":13886293,"kids":[13888098,13887374,13886432,13887780,13887311,13886898],"score":13,"time":1489681351,"title":"Invest in books","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/p/invest-in-books-c945b59fd761"},{"by":"jskinger","descendants":48,"id":13886303,"kids":[13887141,13887539,13887241,13886852,13886828,13886874,13886796,13886692,13886987],"score":76,"time":1489681444,"title":"NASA budget would cut Earth science and education","type":"story","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/nasa-budget-would-cut-earth-science-and-education/2017/03/15/c08e1e2c-0997-11e7-93dc-00f9bdd74ed1_story.html"},{"by":"MsgingABottle","descendants":63,"id":13886266,"kids":[13995673,13887674,13887579,13892514,13886712,13886878,13887119,13887349,13886612,13887509,13894196,13888119,13886997,13890626,13886532,13892176,13901107,13896142,13888331,13898199,13886591,13892209,13888101,13886510,13887179,13886328,13888192,13886499,13887916,13886518,13892864,13887023,13886528],"score":59,"text":"After a brief career in publicity, I decided to make the switch into engineering.

And frankly, it would be extremely clunky to try to implement it throughout our own site.<p>Any wise, informed, practical, helpful, empirical, amusing, or elucidating advice for this adjective-fatigued co-founder?<p>Many thanks!","time":1489524606,"title":"Ask HN: Will I really lose my trademark if I don't use it as an adjective?","type":"story"},{"by":"noir-york","descendants":254,"id":13871422,"kids":[13871691,13871978,13873223,13872117,13872057,13874355,13871950,13872001,13871867,13872097,13872087,13871851,13871928,13876451,13871777,13873669,13873014,13871929,13872459],"score":271,"time":1489525194,"title":"The new legend of Zelda is a toy box of delights","type":"story","url":"https://www.1843magazine.com/culture/the-daily/the-new-legend-of-zelda-is-a-toy-box-of-delights"},{"by":"JumpCrisscross","descendants":5,"id":13871113,"kids":[13873822,13873381],"score":18,"time":1489522771,"title":"A City of Workers Turns to Wilders","type":"story","url":"http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/fallow-ground-a-dutch-city-turns-to-wilders-a-1138641-2.html"},{"by":"teslacar","descendants":156,"id":13871014,"kids":[13872552,13871354,13871183,13871961,13872978,13871513,13871333,13875505,13872377,13871711,13876659,13871159,13874884,13871241,13875793,13874051,13874170,13872870,13871734,13876085,13872019,13878095,13871141,13872033,13872631,13875806,13875045,13871473,13876112,13875294,13873949,13873128,13874537,13873958,13872721,13871699,13876626,13872023,13875526,13872237,13874775,13875887,13871624,13871341,13871421,13876510,13873853],"score":230,"time":1489522018,"title":"Unless You’re Oprah, ‘Be Yourself’ Is Terrible Advice (2016)","type":"story","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/05/opinion/sunday/unless-youre-oprah-be-yourself-is-terrible-advice.html?ne"},{"deleted":true,"id":13871188,"kids":[13871198,13871197],"time":1489523388,"type":"story"},{"by":"jseliger","descendants":2,"id":13870861,"kids":[13871102,13870961],"score":2,"time":1489520881,"title":"Things to know before buying a diamond ring","type":"story","url":"http://iwantwhatitsworth.com/blog/8-things-rational-man-should-know-when-buying-diamond-ring/"},{"by":"leeny","descendants":179,"id":13870737,"kids":[13872236,13872379,13875292,13876195,13872494,13872401,13875404,13873064,13873156,13875700,13873474,13874407,13875424,13872677,13875703,13874319,13872596,13872720,13873997,13872412,13878820,13872970,13874060,13872604,13872772,13872795,13875754,13872650,13876598,13875291,13873649,13874090,13874006,13872812],"score":298,"time":1489520071,"title":"How I got my dream job in the tech industry without a CS degree","type":"story","url":"https://billmei.net/blog/silicon-valley-job-search"},{"by":"schickling","descendants":31,"id":13870379,"kids":[13874057,13870411,13872868,13873028,13871253,13870574,13871992,13875050,13870895,13871022,13873238,13875200],"score":168,"time":1489517746,"title":"Graphql-Up: CLI to create a ready-to-use GraphQL API","type":"story","url":"https://www.graph.cool/graphql-up/"},{"by":"deegles","descendants":5,"id":13870360,"kids":[13870615,13870827,13870992,13870565],"score":10,"time":1489517651,"title":"Map Shows the Animal Most Likely to Kill You in Each State","type":"story","url":"http://www.wideopencountry.com/u-s-map-shows-deadliest-animal-in-each-state/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=partner&utm_term=authtx&utm_campaign=authtx"},{"by":"tvural","descendants":2,"id":13870236,"kids":[13871686,13872841],"score":9,"time":1489516829,"title":"When Equal Access Means Zero Access for All","type":"story","url":"https://fee.org/articles/when-equal-access-means-zero-access-for-all/"},{"by":"firloop","descendants":391,"id":13870199,"kids":[13870755,13871931,13870803,13870789,13871294,13870460,13870945,13871963,13872045,13870540,13873559,13870582,13870673,13870599,13871755,13870376,13870851,13871484,13871015,13871436,13871337,13870849,13874295,13870414,13870284,13875338,13870926,13873086,13870691,13870952,13870681,13876813,13872447,13871717,13872697,13872907,13872947,13873263,13875083,13872274,13870874,13871787,13871325,13870401,13871935,13873039,13888813,13871043,13871573,13870635,13870470,13871228,13871618,13874288,13870727,13871054,13871388,13875809,13873711,13872275,13870275,13871788,13871518,13870590,13870434],"score":1032,"time":1489516576,"title":"Keep the Internet Open","type":"story","url":"http://blog.samaltman.com/keep-the-internet-open"},{"by":"HoppedUpMenace","descendants":2,"id":13870317,"kids":[13870654,13870515,13870528],"score":3,"text":"Why should anyone pay $44k a year in costs to listen to someone speak for nearly 2 hours at length about material mostly irrelevant to assignments and exams (unless its Math related or some course teaching a problem solving technique).

Wikipedia has a page for the paradigm of Array Programming [2] but I&#x27;m not sure If that is what Wilson was implying.

I was beginning to believe that C&#x27;s machine-model was still relevant for CPU cache dynamics, but now with what Wilson says about it being limited by its &quot;Scalar-ness&quot; I&#x27;m beginning to doubt it again.

First time post but long-time lurker.<p>How would you handle this situation?<p>About three weeks ago I applied for senior front-end developer job at a major global airline. I immediately got a response saying they liked my experience and wanted to interview. I was sent specifications for a take-home project to build a web application that would act as a test of my technical ability.<p>The project was relatively simple: A React-Redux app to search for and display data from a json dataset. That being said, there were &quot;bonus&quot; points for adding advanced functionality to the web app, and the recruiter repeatedly told me to take my time on the project to make it &quot;perfect&quot;.<p>So I put my best foot forward [why would you not?], and spent ~40 hours producing a production-grade quality submission that ticked all the boxes, &amp; some more.<p>A week later I got a response from the recruiter saying the interviewer was &quot;very happy&quot; with my submission and wanted to proceed with a final-stage, on-site interview. However, the interviewer&#x27;s manager did could not approve for the budget and they would not be proceeding.<p>What is the appropriate response to this?<p>Should I be contacting someone&#x27;s manager? Can I invoice the company for my time spent on the project? Was I stupid to accept a take-home project in the first place? Are take-home projects fundamentally unethical?<p>Honestly, I feel that I shouldn&#x27;t have been asked to complete a take-home project and pushed to work extra hard on it only to be told the position does not exist.<p>If it matters, I&#x27;ve worked as a web developer for 5 years and 3 as a senior.","time":1489402091,"title":"Ask HN: Take home interview project – is this ok?","type":"story"},{"by":"randomname2","descendants":1,"id":13856688,"kids":[13865246,13858079],"score":2,"time":1489402337,"title":"Up to 15% of Twitter Accounts Are Fake: Study","type":"story","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03107"},{"by":"aframe","descendants":4,"id":13856500,"kids":[13856610,13856663],"score":2,"text":"As the title suggest, interviewing Brian Cox as part of his new shows that are coming to the UK.<p>Anything that you&#x27;ve always wanted to ask Brian Cox, or indeed anyone of his ilk?","time":1489399491,"title":"Ask HN: Interviewing Brian Cox in an hour.

In my study of both Bayesian and frequentist statistics, it seems that the results of a Bayesian analysis are generally more intuitive, such as when comparing Bayesian credible intervals to frequentist confidence intervals. It also seems like Bayesian analysis avoids what I think is one of the most serious problems in analysis, the multiple comparisons problem. It&#x27;s been easy for me to find any number of Bayesian critiques of frequentist stats, but I have rarely seen frequentist defenses against Bayesian stats. This may simply be because I mostly read technology related sites as opposed to more general statistics oriented sites. As such, I would really appreciate hearing some frequentist critiques of Bayesian stats. I feel like the situation can&#x27;t be as cut and dry as one being better than the other in all things, so I would like to acquire a more balanced perspective by hearing about the other side.

I’m Jared, founder at Niko - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getniko.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getniko.com&#x2F;</a>.<p>If you want to make your company a great(er) place to work and want to know what is important to the people you work with, you should try Niko. It is currently in beta. It’s easy to create a group. You can even connect it to Slack.<p>Backstory: I was working at a company where the leaders actively covered up problems and hindered the free flow of information. The health of the company and the people working there was suffering accordingly and it wasn’t solely because our office was in the basement of a converted parking garage.<p>As luck would have it, we hired a Director of Web Engineering who was previously at Twitter. She understood the power of giving people a voice at work, so she set up Google Moderator for the company to use.<p>Moderator was a Google service (shut down in 2015) that used crowdsourcing to rank user-submitted questions, suggestions and ideas. Obama used it.<p>The effect was remarkable and indelible. People felt confident sharing their questions, ideas, and suggestions. Their voices were heard, valuable, and relevant.<p>When my colleagues and I moved on, we took Moderator with us and watched the same remarkable things happen at other companies. It’s not surprising that companies like Google (Google Moderator), Twitter (Falquora), Mozilla (Mozilla Moderator), Yahoo (YoMod), Salesforce, Optimizely and others made, and still use, their own Moderator-like internal tools for employee engagement.<p>When Google Moderator shut down, there was a clear need for a dynamic, modern replacement. That is why I built Niko.<p>You can read more about it here:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackernoon.com&#x2F;employee-engagement-is-broken-here-is-how-to-fix-it-abd22318b7c1#.nq9mciwve\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackernoon.com&#x2F;employee-engagement-is-broken-here-is...</a>","time":1489129470,"title":"Show HN: Niko – Employee Engagement Is Broken – Here’s How to Fix It","type":"story"},{"by":"coder007","descendants":76,"id":13836714,"kids":[13837817,13839009,13837120,13836959,13839415,13837157,13838341,13839022,13841249,13838553,13838892,13837022,13844347,13836933,13837113],"score":227,"time":1489125819,"title":"Data structures and algorithms problems in C++ using STL","type":"story","url":"http://www.techiedelight.com/data-structures-and-algorithms-interview-questions-stl/"},{"by":"mbgaxyz","descendants":11,"id":13836701,"kids":[13836998,13836991,13837010,13837058,13837084,13840587,13837090],"score":29,"time":1489125448,"title":"New York Times Changes January Headline to Remove Mention of Wiretapping","type":"story","url":"http://www.mwilliams.info/archive/2017/03/new-york-times-changes-january-headline-to-remove-mention-of-wiretapping-1.php"},{"by":"nodivbyzero","descendants":13,"id":13836699,"kids":[13844044,13842083,13843020,13842440,13842806,13845422,13845531,13845483],"score":113,"time":1489125428,"title":"Id as Super-Ego: The Creation of Duke Nukem 3D (2001) [pdf]","type":"story","url":"http://fabiensanglard.net/duke3d/id%20as%20Super-Ego-%20The%20Creation%20of%20Duke%20Nukem%203D.pdf"},{"by":"shagunsodhani","descendants":5,"id":13836595,"kids":[13837484,13838224],"score":26,"time":1489123607,"title":"CIA Coding Conventions for Python","type":"story","url":"https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_26607631.html"},{"by":"zorpner","descendants":46,"id":13836588,"kids":[13836809,13836837,13837249,13836796,13844015,13837233,13836755,13836827,13837239],"score":48,"time":1489123487,"title":"Working While Female","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@nickyknacks/working-while-female-59a5de3ad266#.24dxadggq"},{"by":"lainon","descendants":6,"id":13836561,"kids":[13837072,13836646,13837315,13839895,13836921,13839896,13840010],"score":30,"time":1489123057,"title":"Having lots of friends and socialising makes intelligent people miserable (2016)","type":"story","url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3504132/Why-smart-people-tend-loners-Having-lots-friends-socialising-makes-intelligent-people-miserable.html"},{"by":"type0","descendants":30,"id":13836402,"kids":[13836639,13838388,13836960,13836594,13839209,13837389,13839444,13837685],"score":46,"time":1489120479,"title":"Kramdown – A Ruby library for parsing and converting a superset of Markdown","type":"story","url":"https://kramdown.gettalong.org/"},{"by":"WheelsAtLarge","descendants":59,"id":13836167,"kids":[13836759,13836845,13836935,13837709,13837926,13839256,13840768,13840968,13836475,13838701,13838577],"score":188,"time":1489117232,"title":"Deep Learning enables hearing aid wearers to pick out a voice in a crowded room","type":"story","url":"http://spectrum.ieee.org/consumer-electronics/audiovideo/deep-learning-reinvents-the-hearing-aid"},{"by":"johnny313","descendants":3,"id":13835999,"kids":[13836571,13836865],"score":13,"time":1489115239,"title":"NASA Just Found a Lost Spacecraft Orbiting the Moon","type":"story","url":"http://gizmodo.com/nasa-just-found-a-lost-spacecraft-orbiting-the-moon-1793137314"},{"by":"FuckOffNeemo","descendants":1,"id":13835966,"kids":[13836011,13836052],"score":3,"time":1489114624,"title":"WhatsApp to let companies message you for $$$.

My understanding is efen the source code has been out there for a couple of years.<p>If I&#x27;m right then why would this substantially increase tension between Washington and Silicon Valley beyond a couple news cycles?<p>It is very possible that my knowledge of InfoSec is so weak that I don&#x27;t even know when to be surprised...","time":1488957980,"title":"Ask HN: Were the latest Wikileaks releases really new information?","type":"story"},{"by":"mpweiher","descendants":21,"id":13818552,"kids":[13821012,13818838,13821452,13820707,13820683,13820510,13822060,13818773,13819440,13821669,13818622,13818657,13818608,13818629],"score":75,"time":1488957093,"title":"Unlock honest feedback by asking for “advice”","type":"story","url":"https://m.signalvnoise.com/unlock-honest-feedback-with-this-one-word-dcaf3839e7ee#.6245ug2d8"},{"by":"deepaksurti","descendants":57,"id":13818574,"kids":[13820734,13819648,13821353,13820509,13819724,13820871,13819737,13819825,13821703,13819562,13828404,13822972,13836840],"score":79,"text":"What has been your experience and would you recommend it?","time":1488957442,"title":"Ask HN: Anyone moved to PC-BSD (TrueOS) from macOS?","type":"story"},{"by":"silvaben","descendants":3,"id":13818419,"kids":[13818442,13829466],"score":2,"text":"I am looking to build a new web app using Node.js.

We’re building an easy way for people to keep track of their finances. In a nutshell: download the app, connect your accounts, get insights and advice on your finances.<p>We actually got our start on HN over a year ago. Alex and I spent a couple weeks putting together a prototype of the app as a fun side project in between jobs. We launched that on Show HN (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9942202\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9942202</a>), managed to raise a seed round a few months later, and then re-launched on Show HN (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=10858327\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=10858327</a>) several months later. Thanks for the encouragement and feedback along the way!<p>Some things that we’ve learned and&#x2F;or would be happy to discuss:<p>- Having only five categories scaled way further than we thought. It turns out there’s a silent majority that appreciates the simplicity. We just added a premium version that includes subcategories, but we made it over 1.5 years without them.<p>- We built Penny as a web app (Cordova). It pretty much guarantees that we don’t get featured by Apple or Google, but it allows us to iterate really, really quickly. All users always have the latest version, and we can update the app in two minutes flat. We think the tradeoff is worth it.<p>- We’re using a chat interface because it allows Penny to explain your finances in simple, relatable English, but we’re not on any chatbot platforms. We also strongly favor predetermined choices over freeform messages.<p>- Most people don’t realize when they’ve potentially been harmed: over 40% of our Wells Fargo users hadn’t heard about the scandal a month after the news broke. For the Arby’s breach it was over 70%, and for the Navient lawsuits it was 93%.<p>- We decided to roll our own Ruby DSL for writing conversations, which renders a JSON syntax tree that’s interpreted by the client. Right now, Penny has 34,560 words of copy, 888 emojis, and 93 GIFs.","time":1488909911,"title":"Launch HN: Penny (YC W17) – a personal finance coach","type":"story"},{"by":"callahad","descendants":3,"id":13812969,"kids":[13816620,13819176],"score":30,"time":1488910427,"title":"Why WebAssembly is a game changer for the web","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/mozilla-tech/why-webassembly-is-a-game-changer-for-the-web-and-a-source-of-pride-for-mozilla-and-firefox-dda80e4c43cb#.bq1ogvx85"},{"by":"sprite","descendants":82,"id":13812872,"kids":[13814040,13813906,13814985,13813527,13813667,13813607,13813846,13814165,13814075,13814019,13817672,13813688,13817486,13814519],"score":101,"time":1488909875,"title":"Uber drivers in Norway must pay back all earnings and lose their license","type":"story","url":"https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fe24.no%2Fdigital%2Fuber%2Fuber-sjaafoer-tatt-av-oslo-politiet-maa-betale-920-172-kroner%2F23942153&edit-text="},{"by":"evo_9","descendants":1,"id":13812557,"kids":[13817156,13812808],"score":2,"time":1488908148,"title":"Fukushima is worse than ever","type":"story","url":"http://www.cringely.com/2017/02/16/no-fracking-way-fukushima-daiichi-worse-ever/"},{"by":"netinstructions","descendants":7,"id":13812489,"kids":[13815966,13819210,13815572],"score":32,"time":1488907882,"title":"Blue Origin releases details of its monster orbital rocket","type":"story","url":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/03/blue-origin-releases-details-of-its-monster-orbital-rocket/"},{"by":"craigcannon","descendants":7,"id":13813094,"kids":[13813320,13813216],"score":13,"time":1488911127,"title":"YC W17 Launch: Lively, Scaphold, Marketfox, Floyd, ServX, Fibo, and Wifi Dabba","type":"story","url":"https://blog.ycombinator.com/yc-w17-launch-lively-scaphold-marketfox-floyd-servx-fibo-and-wifi-dabba/"},{"by":"Osiris30","descendants":15,"id":13812172,"kids":[13813600,13812476,13812379,13812394],"score":52,"time":1488906490,"title":"Former Tesla executives plan to build $4bn Nordic battery plant","type":"story","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/29e1e89e-0273-11e7-ace0-1ce02ef0def9"},{"by":"ferrantim","descendants":4,"id":13812066,"kids":[13813886,13812464],"score":27,"time":1488906008,"title":"LCFS speeds up docker build by making docker commit a constant time operation","type":"story","url":"https://portworx.com/lcfs-speed-up-docker-commit/"},{"by":"adam","descendants":3,"id":13811937,"kids":[13815484,13816348],"score":17,"time":1488905403,"title":"Show HN: TinyCast – crowdsource with your team the likelihood of meeting metrics","type":"story","url":"https://tinycast.cultivatelabs.com"},{"by":"t0dd","descendants":235,"id":13811914,"kids":[13813318,13812140,13813155,13812619,13812698,13812779,13812532,13813070,13812258,13812064,13812085,13812703,13812706,13813599,13813156,13812579,13812620,13813217,13813003,13812251,13812427],"score":412,"time":1488905338,"title":"WikiLeaks Releases Trove of Alleged C.I.A.

It&#x27;s code that might be needed in a particular context, but not always. One member of my team adds annoying printf statements and repetitive assertions as debugging aids to code for which he is primarily responsible. I&#x27;d love to see his code without all the cruft.

That ended up being right, considering it’s now the most successful attack vector for breaching companies. I wanted to change the way people solved this problem and that’s how Apozy was born. I introduced the idea to my now cofounder, Erhan, and he was onboard almost immediately. Erhan was the best developer I knew, had run a development firm in the past and was a hacker by hobby.<p>Fast forward to today, we’re busy building our solution to next-gen attacks. Apozy’s browser extension immunizes you against phishing and malware attacks. Phishing is out of control--1 in 3 companies fall victim to CEO fraud emails alone--and the current approach of blacklisting sites can&#x27;t keep up. Instead, Apozy analyzes your browsing habits to stop you from entering data into suspicious sites that don&#x27;t fit your usage patterns. We also aim to protect privacy by providing objective site privacy ratings, stopping trackers, and upgrading connections to HTTPS. Apozy is currently free to download on the Chrome store and soon will be on Firefox.<p>To check out Apozy, you can visit our site at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apozy.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apozy.com</a> or head over to the Chrome store at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;apozy-trusted-browsing&#x2F;akgjbibhebefdjbebhpmknohhojhppeb\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;apozy-trusted-brow...</a>.","time":1488823210,"title":"Launch HN: Apozy (YC W17) – Use browsing habits to stop phishing and spot breaches","type":"story"},{"by":"mpweiher","descendants":4,"id":13803828,"kids":[13806340,13807159,13805475,13809309],"score":27,"time":1488818781,"title":"Communication Files: Interprocess IO Before Pipes [pdf]","type":"story","url":"http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/DTSS/commfiles.pdf"},{"by":"jcoffland","descendants":237,"id":13803946,"kids":[13811632,13811343,13806533,13810534,13810813,13814194,13812048,13814205,13810474,13811143,13811192,13815045,13813011,13814737,13810705,13815379,13812185,13812115,13810421,13814109,13810442,13813889,13813231,13811641,13813805,13812530,13816392,13811388,13806747,13816357,13810453,13811700,13810413,13811637,13813739,13810950,13812983,13810948,13810431,13817642,13811666,13812611,13815191,13810448,13811118,13810581,13810636,13811255,13812836,13814817,13814760,13811288,13813316,13811605,13810670,13812737,13813489,13810356,13813152,13813990,13811392,13810626,13813872,13812986,13806896,13813219,13818771,13814056,13813606,13810883,13813482,13813723,13811931,13814057,13812175,13810949,13814016,13811064,13812629,13825119,13810203,13809235,13817132,13810960,13811762,13812169,13816384,13811260,13811419,13815545,13812633,13811486,13815663,13810514,13816834,13811608,13814341,13810582,13818811,13811350,13815724,13810341,13813121,13810963,13814813,13814801,13812342,13816185,13813753,13818828,13814931,13816261,13812416,13812871,13813242,13812708,13816246,13812638,13817863,13820300,13813755,13818812,13813756,13818813],"score":218,"text":"Excluding school projects and toy languages, who here has created a programming language and why?<p>I&#x27;ll go first.  13 years ago I created a specialized language for processing XML data.

We usually do concurrency analysis. Yesterday we received Disney&#x27;s Circle box. It&#x27;s a device you connect to your wifi and lists all the devices in your network ; then you can monitor those devices, deny them access to websites and even access their browsing history.<p>While these features aren&#x27;t new, the fact that it&#x27;s a portable 3rd party device in your network puts it into a very higher level of wrong ethics :<p>1. It is claimed to be used in your own home, but nothing prevents you from connecting to your neighbors or workplace wifi and some public places too<p>2. As it&#x27;s using &quot;hacker techniques for good&quot;, there is NO action on the monitored device to do to enable or prevent monitoring, so you can browse history on your wife&#x27;s computer or your boss&#x27;s phone.<p>3. There&#x27;s even a battery embedded so you can carry it and monitor on the fly.<p>This device is intented to prevent your children from browsing porn or using facebook instead of studying ; especially at a time where snapchat and dickpics are a thing... BUT :<p>1. If gateway manufacturers were caring, they&#x27;d make similar features because 90% routers are built with OpenWRT which has the features. It would at least be really limited to your home.<p>2. How many scenarii could go wrong with that ? What if some child looks for his sex orientation and he doesn&#x27;t want to tell by fear of judgment? How many wife&#x2F;husband will buy it to spy on AshleyMadison visits? How many will use in work places for blackmailing?<p>3. Do you really think a child of today won&#x27;t find ways to reach the content your forbid? Ways are for people to bypass these rules, and still if not enough, that content is available on public wifi...<p>It for sure comes from good intentions ; but evil can be found in the best

Lively is a Health Savings Account platform for employers and individuals. If you are unfamiliar with an HSA, think of it as the 401(k) for healthcare. We are in the current batch at YC and are excited to share our offering with you.<p>Lively was born over a year ago with personal experiences that both Alex (my co-founder) and I experienced firsthand. The short story is that we were experiencing a lot more out-of-pocket medical expenses than we were prepared for. That is what propelled us to begin looking around and came across the health savings account. The HSA is a triple tax-advantaged account (in the US, so we&#x27;re US-only) that allows you to contribute pre-tax dollars, invest your money and let it grow tax-free, and withdraw money tax-free so long as it is used for qualified medical expenses (at any point in the future). It has been an industry dominated by banks and other financial institutions and we saw an opportunity to enter it by focusing on user experience.<p>Alex and I are life-long friends and see this as an important problem to help solve. We are also happy to answer questions about our business, but also health savings accounts and high deductible health plans.","time":1488564046,"title":"Launch HN: Lively (YC W17) – 401(k) for Healthcare","type":"story"},{"by":"kacy","descendants":8,"id":13784626,"kids":[13785545,13784847,13784906,13790549,13786402,13788497],"score":37,"time":1488563472,"title":"AWS Users: How do you track your costs?","type":"story"},{"by":"azuajef","descendants":86,"id":13784564,"kids":[13784648,13784775,13785457,13784972,13785663,13785619],"score":69,"time":1488563042,"title":"I was forcibly deported from the UK like a terrorist, restrained and under guard","type":"story","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/02/irene-clennell-deported-uk-terrorist"},{"by":"danjoc","descendants":235,"id":13784521,"kids":[13785247,13785261,13784891,13784996,13788606,13787192,13784832,13785304,13785124,13785174,13785483,13789659,13785225,13790096,13784818,13789021,13789446,13786467,13789281,13788299,13785139,13790007,13785791,13784990,13785488,13785411,13787855,13786899,13791097,13786268,13784814,13787518,13789387,13785305,13789054,13786269,13787564,13786131,13786395,13789838,13785568,13784838,13785774,13785860],"score":415,"time":1488562759,"title":"Razer targets perfect Linux support","type":"story","url":"https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1333298720061240&substory_index=0&id=113306788727112"},{"by":"inostia","descendants":22,"id":13784667,"kids":[13784907,13785754,13784852,13784983,13785021,13789377,13792849,13790626,13787979,13785847,13786367,13785269,13784904,13785365,13809668,13803356,13785091,13788633,13785090,13790749,13792783,13785820],"score":14,"text":"I currently work in higher ed as a developer in SF but am thinking about moving into the private world.

Or get paged at 2am when the user experience is broken?<p>Armory.io makes deployments boring (like ‘waiting for your code to compile’ boring), non-events that happen continuously, and always in the background.  We do that by simplifying the installation and configuration of Spinnaker - an open source continuous delivery platform from Netflix.<p>We all worked together at our last company and experienced the pain of scary deployments with low engineering velocity.  When I became the SVP Engineering there, I decided that needed to change.  We broke a brittle monolith app up into microservices, started deploying with Kubernetes, and created a CI&#x2F;CD pipeline that allowed us to go from deploying just a few painful times per month (taking weeks and multiple manager approvals to deploy) to 2,000x deployments per month, continuously.  The cascading effects were that we started working on parts of the codebase that had been stagnant for years because we were afraid to touch them (the original developers had long left the company).  Here’s a screenshot of a chart that shows the delta: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;drod.io&#x2F;43452e3V0N28\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;drod.io&#x2F;43452e3V0N28</a> — each color is a different microservice; you can see how those blossomed as we broke the monolith up and started deploying each microservice on the cadence that was best for it.  And we had much happier engineers, too, because they could see their code running immediately in production, and they took ownership of it running successfully in prod (as a side effect we went from a traditional ops team to a no-ops approach).<p>We were so passionate about the transformative effect this had on the company that we started Armory to bring it to any company — which is especially needed in large, low performing organizations that typically deploy just 7x per year (compared to 4,000x per day at Netflix).<p>We’d love to hear your stories of deployments gone wrong, hear your questions about Armory, or anything else on your mind!","time":1488477657,"title":"Launch HN: Armory.io (YC W17) – We Make Deployments Boring and Self-Service","type":"story"},{"by":"Shivetya","descendants":9,"id":13776304,"kids":[13780761,13776376,13778081,13777563],"score":12,"time":1488476943,"title":"Robots won't just take our jobs – they'll make the rich even richer","type":"story","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/02/robot-tax-job-elimination-livable-wage"},{"by":"avinassh","descendants":25,"id":13776245,"kids":[13779150,13776423,13783285,13778271,13783145,13776499,13779810],"score":7,"text":"I am not sure how common it is in Silicon Valley, but in India following questions are very common and I really find it difficult to understand why interviewer is asking them and what exactly he expects to understand from me:<p>1.

Backend programming would require intimate knowledge of threads, mutexes, async and other things which a frontend programmer may not be familiar with so using the same programmer or language may be moot.<p>- Flaky drivers. Surely it works great with MongoDB but try using MariaDB, Postgres with concurrency and pooling and there are so many issues (async is hard ?).<p>- Is Node.js performance really that good when people start making mistakes and bugs arise that infact hinders performance. Why people move to Node.js when horizontal scaling can provide sufficient performance needed by most.<p>These are only couple of points, may be Hackernews can give more perspective towards why some of the people&#x2F;companies choose Node.js with these flaws. Is it because it&#x27;s new or the love of Javascript (designed in less than 1 month) is so much that it has bleed into the backend realm.","time":1488432833,"title":"Why are so many companies using Node.js?","type":"story"},{"by":"max0563","descendants":5,"id":13771635,"kids":[13771744,13771690,13771675],"score":2,"time":1488432114,"title":"Ask HN: Should I continue with my idea even though it already exists?","type":"story"},{"by":"rusht","descendants":17,"id":13771753,"kids":[13772891,13772139,13772442,13778777,13772543,13777414,13772704],"score":35,"time":1488433475,"title":"Ask HN: Data scientists, what tools do you use the most on a daily basis?","type":"story"},{"by":"bezieio","descendants":27,"id":13771475,"kids":[13773016,13772110,13772128,13772011,13772269,13772803,13777061,13772182,13775416,13772150],"score":41,"time":1488429679,"title":"Show HN: Bezie – Virtual MIDI controller for complex automation","type":"story","url":"http://www.bezie.io"},{"by":"uladzislau","descendants":505,"id":13771421,"kids":[13772121,13772168,13771609,13771867,13771684,13771577,13771908,13771807,13771664,13772146,13771683,13772736,13771750,13771633,13772534,13774339,13771631,13771708,13772230,13772603,13772426,13772751],"score":323,"time":1488428762,"title":"Lyft Is Said to Seek New Funding as Its Rival Uber Stumbles","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/technology/lyft-funding-uber.html"},{"by":"sandGorgon","descendants":70,"id":13771292,"kids":[13772668,13774283,13772759,13773523,13774043,13774210,13772469,13773240,13773022,13772967,13776750,13778287,13774267,13774359,13772449,13775176,13773118,13775609,13774325,13773642],"score":364,"time":1488427142,"title":"Facebook releases 300-dimensional pretrained Fasttext vectors for 90 languages","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/blob/master/pretrained-vectors.md"},{"by":"maingi4","descendants":64,"id":13771429,"kids":[13772135,13774041,13774546,13774457,13775661,13775780,13774186,13772696,13774413,13772004,13772670,13775497,13779227,13775121,13776714],"score":142,"time":1488428847,"title":"AWS Lambda – Best practices","type":"story","url":"https://cloudncode.blog/2017/03/02/best-practices-aws-lambda-function/"},{"by":"lingben","dead":true,"id":13771258,"kids":[13771322,13771284],"score":10,"time":1488426597,"title":"Nigerian engineer handed written test at New York airport","type":"story","url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-39127617?"},{"by":"philliphaydon","descendants":6,"id":13771317,"kids":[13774314,13772376,13771417,13771352],"score":3,"text":"I&#x27;ve spent my (12 year) career doing .NET and web related stuff.

In my area, there are no companies looking for interns, so I think I&#x27;ll have to work remotely or abroad.<p>I&#x27;ve been programming for around 8 years now and got some experience (personal projects, open source, and occasional freelance) in C++, C#, Java (on Android), PHP, RoR, Python, and Golang.

Deep Voice lays the groundwork for truly end-to-end neural speech synthesis. The system comprises five major building blocks: a segmentation model for locating phoneme boundaries, a grapheme-to-phoneme conversion model, a phoneme duration prediction model, a fundamental frequency prediction model, and an audio synthesis model. For the segmentation model, we propose a novel way of performing phoneme boundary detection with deep neural networks using connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss. For the audio synthesis model, we implement a variant of WaveNet that requires fewer parameters and trains faster than the original. By using a neural network for each component, our system is simpler and more flexible than traditional text-to-speech systems, where each component requires laborious feature engineering and extensive domain expertise. Finally, we show that inference with our system can be performed faster than real time and describe optimized WaveNet inference kernels on both CPU and GPU that achieve up to 400x speedups over existing implementations.","time":1488310002,"title":"Deep Voice: Real-Time Neural Text-To-Speech for Production","type":"story"},{"by":"aestetix","descendants":3,"id":13756677,"kids":[13756734,13757086,13756755],"score":5,"text":"So far it seems to include gotomeeting, trello, parts of slack, and others.

However, making a board that caters to our need is important to us and we have a good budget to get it done.<p>Would the community mind sharing some advice on a layout&#x2F;design service that can take our purpose need and develop a good solution prototype for us?<p>Thank you for any time spent responding.","time":1488225001,"title":"Ask HN: How can a rural small business get a custom PCB made?","type":"story"},{"by":"newy","descendants":5,"id":13747208,"kids":[13747485,13747328],"score":5,"time":1488224352,"title":"Solving for the Last Mile of Transportation","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@derrickko/solving-for-the-last-mile-of-transportation-6ffbfec5542#.1eukt3e7g"},{"by":"plmongeau","descendants":3,"id":13747200,"kids":[13747461,13747310,13747210],"score":2,"time":1488224314,"title":"Show HN: A curated boutique that finds the best coffee products on Amazon","type":"story","url":"http://cafetier.co/"},{"by":"runesoerensen","descendants":142,"id":13747177,"kids":[13747409,13747698,13748848,13747582,13747201,13749042,13747483,13747534,13747333,13750525,13747369,13748030,13747294,13747552,13749075,13748170,13747647],"score":359,"time":1488224072,"title":"Uber's SVP of engineering is out","type":"story","url":"http://www.recode.net/2017/2/27/14745360/amit-singhal-google-uber"},{"by":"taigeair","descendants":9,"id":13747154,"kids":[13748566,13748547],"score":29,"time":1488223934,"title":"Why I’m leaving Snapchat and so are all your friends","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/charged-tech/why-im-leaving-snapchat-and-so-are-all-your-friends-dd241f0cd14#.3vldpxq7n"},{"by":"whitepoplar","descendants":97,"id":13746926,"kids":[13748063,13747879,13748074,13748121,13748203,13748607,13748471,13748228,13748024,13752278,13748226,13748409,13748324,13747018,13748025],"score":105,"time":1488222731,"title":"Why Socialism for the Rich, Capitalism for the Poor?","type":"story","url":"http://europe.newsweek.com/robert-reich-why-socialism-rich-capitalism-poor-455066?rm=eu"},{"by":"qdot76367","descendants":445,"id":13746830,"kids":[13747119,13747145,13747024,13747251,13746950,13747113,13747324,13746907,13747740,13746963,13747273,13746970,13746912,13746938,13749379,13747127,13747341,13755235,13747057,13752482,13746985,13746892,13751487,13749313,13748001,13747114,13747083,13747434,13747836,13748017,13755708,13748246,13748694,13750836,13747370,13747693,13752408,13786738,13750782,13747615,13754243,13746885,13747817,13751838,13748291,13747791,13747927,13746944,13747132,13747213,13747271,13751393,13747063,13747920,13748606,13746898,13748466,13748564,13752614,13747148,13747121,13749428,13747089,13747431,13746947,13748180],"score":1187,"time":1488222193,"title":"Mozilla Acquires Pocket","type":"story","url":"https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/02/27/mozilla-acquires-pocket/"},{"by":"tarr11","descendants":2,"id":13746655,"kids":[13746772,13747653],"score":4,"text":"I often like to follow a single post, which can have an active and lively discussion in the comments.<p>I may come back a few hours later or the next day, to see if there are new comments.

Worked in the city, south bay and the peninsula. I&#x27;m a full stack engineer, I switched employers 7 times in 10 years constantly getting pulled into another hot opportunity! Sometimes from ex-colleagues, most of the times from recruiters. Looking at glassdoor.com and my personal experience, salaries are much lower than what people are claiming on HN. There are exceptions out there, Google, etc. I&#x27;ve been their myself as well as another one of the big 5. Experienced engineers make a lot of money but it&#x27;s mostly coming from Stock&#x2F;RSU&#x27;s and sometimes bonuses. I&#x27;d totally believe it if you tell me &quot;my total offer was about $300-500&#x2F;k&quot;, but it&#x27;s not yearly. And the base salary is rarely $200k&#x2F;year for a &quot;simple&quot; individual contributor. Unless you&#x27;re a guru at google. It seems that a lot of guru&#x27;s at google are active on HN :) Most of it comes from RSU&#x27;s or stocks cumulated after several years (or well negotiated when hired). The vesting period is usually 4 years, not one year, so you can&#x27;t really say my package is $500k. It doesn&#x27;t mean anything. I would say, the base salary for 10 years of exp in Web&#x2F;Mobile or any related field is about $140-$170k per year on average. After tax it&#x27;s obviously way lower.<p>A lot (too many) people on HN are claiming $200k base salary per year as being totally normal.

This startup has a SaaS product and ~3000 users. The code behind the product is not as good as it could be: There’s some design flaws and a lot of depreciated dependencies…  hard to test, hard to maintain, etc. Despite that, fix all the flaws would require a lot less effort than recreate from scratch.<p>With that in mind the team have decided last year(before I’ve joined) that they are going to change from the monolithic architecture we have today to a microservice architecture.<p>At first sight I had no problem with that but in the last month I’ve done some research about microservices. Now I believe that microservice is a horrible idea in our case.<p>I’m not going into details of why I think microservices is a bad idea, this is not the point here. The point I need some guidance is: How should I approach this question?<p>I tried to start a discussion about it with some people of the team, then I discovery that there’s a really strong confirmation bias in favor of microservices around there. Their arguments were just some common sense that I could easily refute. But just an informal talk with everyone had no result, just some more common sense.<p>I’m thinking about write a document with all my arguments and some facts to send it to the team. Would this be a good approach? I&#x27;m really new in the startup environment and I don’t know how everyone else solve this kind of problem.<p>Any suggestion would be nice.

I decided its now or never.<p>What 8 years of IT experience has shown me is that you are constantly thrown at the hottest problem &#x2F; issue and asked to resolve them. Rarely did i feel the sense of accomplishment and i didn&#x27;t feel that under such pressure to deliver there was any scope for mastery of a subject. Everyone has just 24 hours in a day, and all the time was taken up by the job + commute + daily grind. Not complaining as such, but i had to face the truth.<p>Shallow work was prevalent everywhere, and no scope for solid work. It left a void in me, and i crave fulfillment.<p>What i wish to do is instead search for work instead of a job (i deliberately differentiate here). Currently i can manage to stay afloat for 3 months with the savings i have. So any guidance on how i could make this time fruitful would be highly appreciated and i would be thankful. I would also appreciate any guidance on how to design my career and work life so i wouldn&#x27;t find myself facing this again.<p>i have worked on linux (have basic sysadmin skills) + shell + perl + python ( actively learning currently ).<p>PS : I have self-taught all i know about  development.","time":1488091358,"title":"Ask HN: I quit my job.

Factor in things like % of population who is unable to pay anything.

But they already do something similar by taking the doctors oath.<p>- Costs would change as doctors would charge based on their costs, which would change under a new system.  This should normalize quickly and become predictable.<p>- A person&#x27;s medical history is not a factor<p>- Healthcare cannot be insurance-based because its not actually optional.

The pay seems ridiculously low. I work as a data scientist now, and the prospect of spending 2 years studying, only to make way less money than I do now is unappealing.<p>3. Oversupply of bioinformaticians. I have the impression from reading online that there is an oversupply of people with bioinformatics masters degrees. I can&#x27;t tell how true this is.<p>4. Lack of respect and long term career options.

It utilises your GitHub releases so that there is no need to duplicate information.<p>We also offer several other conveniences, for instance it&#x27;s common to have several repositories that make up an overall product (we have three core ones that make up our app). ReleasePage can combine your notes for each project into one release.

We started working on Bitrise when we were running our dev agency, building apps for clients. It was frustrating to go through all the manual tasks when somebody needed a fresh build, or when all the bugs piled up before releases. We wanted to automate all the manual aspects of app development so we could get back to coding, because that’s what we loved to do.<p>We’ve started with iOS CI&#x2F;CD, because that seemed to be the hardest and that’s what we had the most experience in. For starters we had to build up a scalable Mac infrastructure, since iOS apps can only be compiled on a Mac machine. That was tough.<p>We also wanted to make setting up and maintaining CI way easier, without scripting, but having the same level of customizability. We’ve come up with an easy workflow and step system, where steps are ready-made and reusable building blocks responsible for one task, like git cloning, deploying to HockeyApp, etc, and workflows are a succession of these steps. All of these steps are open source, and since we started the library grew to more than 100 integrations, around 30 added by the community (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bitrise.io&#x2F;integrations\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bitrise.io&#x2F;integrations</a>).<p>Tens of thousands of apps are being built on Bitrise including Foursquare, InVision, Pagerduty, Grindr. We are attracting so many apps because we are the most open platform in this space. In addition to our step library, we’ve open sourced our CLI, our webhook service and all of our build images, and we’re growing together with our awesome community.<p>We raised $200k in 2015 and became profitable last year.

I&#x27;ve been going to school one class per quarter for a few years while working full-time and supporting my wife during her second degree, but now that she graduated I&#x27;ve recently quit my job and this is my first full-time academic quarter.<p>I&#x27;ve recently discovered that the professor teaching my algorithms course is somewhat well-known in the cryptology field, which is exciting for me as an interest in and passion for crypto is what got me to go back to school and study CS. I would really like to pursue an academic relationship with this professor, but I&quot;m not sure what the best way to do that would be, or even necessarily what that would like. I&#x27;m essentially thinking of someone from whom I could ask for a letter of reference, and ask for course&#x2F;topic of study recommendations, that kind of thing; perhaps even as an adviser for the independent-study type credits that are offered. I feel like I have better-than-average interpersonal skills and perspective compared to the just-out-of-high-school students who make up most of my classmates, but having worked a full-time job for the last ten years and having only recently gotten into computer science, I don&#x27;t really have side-projects of my own I can talk to him about, which seems like a disadvantage.  I&#x27;m performing well in his class, though I&#x27;m not at the very top.

I have some time to consider how I want to structure the course before I review my plan with the department. So I was hoping to get the HN community&#x27;s take on two things that I am having a hard time balancing in my plan:<p><pre><code>    - Improving learning and modernizing classroom procedures\n    - Preventing cheating\n</code></pre>\nBasically, I&#x27;m interested in the possibility of using Git, Github, and a CI testing service to deliver, collect, and (at least partially) grade assignments via the most commonly used VCS workflow used by projects hosted on the platform. That is: everyone forks, pulls down, pushes up upon completion, submits PR for testing&#x2F;review.<p>Overall I like the idea because it would expose them to these basic workflow &amp; development lifecycle concepts early. Later, if they take well to it, I would like to explore creating assignments that are multi-stage and legitimately collaborative between me and them (perhaps organized into small groups). I think there is a lot of potential for learning there. And the platform removes a lot of the tedious parts of the process on my end.<p>But, there is a pretty big catch to running a course my preferred way though: other students will see each other&#x27;s pull requests (ie. their completed assignments). In the minds of most faculty, the concern is that this would promote cheating. Academic integrity is something institutions need to protect to ensure the future value of their degree offerings, and enforcing individual assessments of all learning objectives is the way used to achieve that.<p>The on-again-off-again professor in me agrees with that, but the working software engineer in me is a lot less sure.<p>Any thoughts on this from the software professional side of the tracks? I&#x27;m asking the same to other professors that I know as well.

We&#x27;re building FloydHub to be a “Heroku for deep learning”. We are in the current batch (W17) at YC. But I still like to think of FloydHub as being an HN incubated startup.<p>10 months ago, I was working at Microsoft and doing a lot of deep learning (DL) there. While the DL community is terrific, I was often frustrated by how difficult it was to get started and build upon others’ work. For example, running any popular Github project often started with an exercise in dependency hell. As I untangled these for myself, I wrote up some notes on setting up popular DL frameworks, which unexpectedly started trending on HN after someone posted it there (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11697571\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11697571</a>). That&#x27;s when I realized that engineering was a huge bottleneck in deep learning and a problem worth solving after all.<p>I’ve since quit my job and have been working fulltime for the last 9 months on building FloydHub to make deep learning easier. Our goal is to let the data scientists focus on the science, while we handle the engineering grunt work (provisioning and scaling infra, running reproducible experiments, enabling sharing and collaboration, supporting DL frameworks with zero setup, shipping trained models to production easily, etc.) Lots of interesting challenges - happy to talk about them!<p>We have a lot of work ahead, but we’re excited to share with you what we have so far!

HN!\nI&#x27;ve just started a job as a project manager for a school in Sweden, with children ages 6-15. I am going to help them develop the use of programming, makerspace and other forms of digital creation in education. My own background is in engineering, but I have no experience in teaching&#x2F;pedagogics. The school has already purchased a lot of equipment, from bluebots to arduinos and a 3d printer. The project is still in its infancy, so we still don&#x27;t have any clear plan yet. My hope is that, during the year I will work with this, that we can find some kind of framework that will enable the staff and students to work with programming and related subjects and on their own gradually develop the work.<p>I have some questions that I would love to get your input on:\n1. What are good ways to introduce children and teens to programming? What are the different &quot;pedagogical pathways&quot;? \n2. How can we adress that all students will learn at different speeds, with varying levels of interest and require different levels of difficulty to keep them challenged? Now that I think about, I guess this is a general challenge in all fields.\n3. Is there a map of different concepts that are basic to learning programming, like logical operations and control flow? Is there any kind of knowledge base available of exercises for these different concepts?\n4. Any good tips of good learning tools&#x2F;platforms? Like bluebot, quirkbot and rpi or pure software tools like lightbot?\n5. Are there any reasonable limitations for what should be focused on? I am thinking that there are so many different concepts and tools to introduce and work with and that it may be that we try to do too many things at once.\n6.

I was told some things by an ex-programmer friend of mine (he now outsources all his programming and merely manages his businesses) and wanted to check with a larger group whether he’s putting me on the right track.<p>So the general idea is that I need to create an interface for my customers. R doesn’t have a UI system, so I thought of using Python, as I heard it is similar to R. However, my friend said that Python software is easily reverse engineered, meaning my software could be stolen or copied, leaving me with fewer customers and new competitors.<p>He recommended Java for this reason. Specifically, to create a product that secures my backend (lol), he said I must learn Java IDE aka Eclipse and Java SDK. Two questions:<p>Is he right?\nHow large is the gap between R programming and Java programming?<p>I aim to create an MVP of the product before registering my business and showing the MVP to potential clients. Thus, I would like to estimate the timeline of the project. The actual coding should be fast and simple in R – mainly data input followed by correlation calculations and the output of a metric – but the time-consuming step, I figure, will be applying my R knowledge in the Java paradigm.<p>Thanks for reading this far.","time":1487056575,"title":"Is Java Our Best Choice to Protect Our Code?","type":"story"},{"by":"chrisbolt","descendants":57,"id":13641499,"kids":[13642333,13641727,13646481,13644502,13644482,13642475,13642630,13644787,13642851,13646229,13643690,13643996,13642341,13642860],"score":133,"time":1487051574,"title":"Amazon EBS Update – New Elastic Volumes Change Everything","type":"story","url":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-ebs-update-new-elastic-volumes-change-everything/"},{"by":"known","descendants":122,"id":13641582,"kids":[13642057,13642022,13642448,13641898,13641872,13642915,13642157,13644605,13642692,13642009,13643069,13643290,13642328,13641985],"score":110,"time":1487052676,"title":"Silicon Valley Is Using H-1B Visas to Pay Low Wages to Immigrants","type":"story","url":"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-h-1b_us_5890d86ce4b0522c7d3d84af"},{"by":"Jerry2","descendants":10,"id":13641419,"kids":[13645240,13641959,13642369,13647270,13642205],"score":30,"time":1487050522,"title":"H-1B reduced computer programmer employment by up to 11%, study finds","type":"story","url":"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/h-1b-reduced-computer-programmer-employment-by-up-to-11-study-finds-2017-02-13"},{"by":"gukov","descendants":34,"id":13641399,"kids":[13641519,13641511,13641556,13641741,13641483,13641491,13641673,13641496,13641585,13641709],"score":20,"time":1487050278,"title":"Freedom of Speech Is Now Largely an Illusion","type":"story","url":"http://blog.dilbert.com/post/157201503761/freedom-of-speech-is-now-largely-an-illusion"},{"by":"vyrotek","descendants":100,"id":13641386,"kids":[13642194,13641839,13642033,13642372,13643278,13643354,13642279,13642492,13642591,13642088,13644990,13642352,13642364,13646688,13642549,13642207,13645038,13643251,13642024,13643978,13641950,13642087,13641908],"score":265,"time":1487050161,"title":"Happy 15th Birthday .NET","type":"story","url":"https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/02/13/happy-15th-birthday-net/"},{"by":"richardboegli","descendants":139,"id":13641377,"kids":[13643466,13641648,13641858,13642083,13641470,13641707,13643762,13644015,13641521,13645445,13644148,13642458,13643797,13644560,13642674,13643911,13644463,13644527,13644670,13644067,13644731,13646142,13644080],"score":403,"time":1487049984,"title":"Is PostgreSQL good enough?","type":"story","url":"http://renesd.blogspot.com/2017/02/is-postgresql-good-enough.html"},{"by":"kungfudoi","descendants":2,"id":13641355,"kids":[13642644,13646929],"score":39,"time":1487049737,"title":"How to build a 8 GPU password cracker","type":"story","url":"https://www.shellntel.com/blog/2017/2/8/how-to-build-a-8-gpu-password-cracker"},{"by":"drepricruf","descendants":2,"id":13641349,"kids":[13641807,13644936],"score":4,"text":"iOS Developer about to interview for Android Developer role.

Am I being silly in even considering building something which already exists in a different market (for now)?<p>Thanks!","time":1486736641,"title":"Ask HN: Found an identical product to mine.

It looked that I renewed it when they are transferring it to an internal account, and they auction against the ICANN rules. As they don&#x27;t send any notification that the domain is removed from your account, they seem to rely on people with multiple domains not noticing or people with a few domains not to know their rights. By the time you notice and 30 days after expiry pass, there&#x27;s nothing you can do - well, at least this is what they tell you! Most people would give up - and that&#x27;s what they expect. Something like this happened to me, but I don&#x27;t want to be a sheeple. What would you recommend to me? Their response says that they refunded my renewal and that because the domain was not renewed 30 days after expiry, it went on an action! So, although I obviously did as they&#x27;re refunding me, they still claim that nonsense! Why are we allowing this to happen to us? Do you lose your number after you fail to pay your phone bill?

Seems like like Kokkos, RaftLib and FastFlow get away with the least boilerplate code but they all seem rather early stage. Kokkos looks like it&#x27;ll do GPGPU which is cool but not necessarily a requirement. Googling turns up lots and lots of frameworks. Is there anything more mature out there?

I joined early on, but not as a co-founder. Most dev is outsourced - my role is to advise on what is technically possible, liaise with outsourced developers, develop BI tools, and handle the sysadmin. This means getting alerts at odd hours of the day and restarting servers etc, but my role is not full time and has been fairly ad-hoc up until now.<p>The startup has received funding totalling around $600k USD over 2 rounds. Since the 1st round of funding, the full-time two co-founders and designer have been receiving a (low) salary, but a salary nonetheless. Having recently received a second round, this is likely to increase.<p>After my first 6m, I was entitled to options and told I would be sent the details and confirmation shortly. I chased this up last week (18m later), and was told they hadn&#x27;t implemented a benefits scheme so hadn&#x27;t been formally allocated anything, but that it was being worked on.<p>After the second round of funding, I advised them that they should get a full-time CTO. The new CTO starts in 2 weeks time and is on decent money. The intention is that I stay on in an advisory role.<p>Another guy in the team in a similar position (he has done unpaid work, but invested less time than I) recently enquired as to whether in light of investment, we would receive any bonuses. The CTO answered that he would like to offer us something, that the investors may not be willing, but that we should find out in the next month or so.<p>I am still being asked to do work. Should I do it? So far, I have received no cash or shares. They have hired a well paid CTO to do my job full-time.

Also curious to know if there are lessons and struggles to learn from globally.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Housing_segregation_in_the_United_States<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;southernspaces.org&#x2F;2015&#x2F;segregations-new-geography-atlanta-metro-region-race-and-declining-prospects-upward-mobility<p>[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;12&#x2F;05&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;ben-carson-housing-urban-development-trump.html","time":1486052621,"title":"Ask HN: Disrupting housing segregation in the US?","type":"story"},{"by":"samlittlewood","descendants":316,"id":13551610,"kids":[13551897,13551944,13552982,13552203,13552010,13551861,13552838,13552123,13552370,13552079,13552841,13553805,13553010,13551883,13557118,13554112,13553699,13551761,13551874,13553168,13552180,13556213,13558428,13552498,13552355,13556663,13555251,13552176,13556497,13553623,13552726,13554204,13551854,13553693,13551796,13553309,13551909],"score":505,"time":1486052152,"title":"John Carmack on expert witnesses and 'non literal' copying","type":"story","url":"https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1913546895546485&id=100006735798590"},{"by":"hourislate","descendants":464,"id":13551635,"kids":[13553848,13552235,13552664,13554157,13552289,13552049,13552139,13554095,13552923,13552334,13552452,13552222,13552013,13554596,13557629,13552287,13552882,13553776,13554593,13552165,13553444,13553618,13552789,13552884,13553645,13553812,13552870,13557824,13556627,13558447,13557989,13553095,13560331,13555640,13553193,13556372,13554172,13558518,13561861,13557326,13553748,13556676,13553501,13552643,13552908,13552167,13552040,13553741],"score":165,"time":1486052269,"title":"The woes of Windows 10","type":"story","url":"http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21715831-why-so-many-pc-users-are-refusing-upgrade-windows-10-woes-windows-10"},{"by":"dbarlett","descendants":16,"id":13551534,"kids":[13552766,13553162,13552191,13552669,13552300,13552159,13552713],"score":36,"time":1486051723,"title":"Hosted S/MIME by Google provides enhanced security for Gmail in the enterprise","type":"story","url":"https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/hosted-smime-by-google-provides.html"},{"by":"Ritjert","descendants":3,"id":13551475,"kids":[13566278,13554760],"score":8,"time":1486051461,"title":"Ask HN: Is how to build the future canceled?","type":"story"},{"by":"pka","descendants":31,"id":13551404,"kids":[13552046,13553221,13552284,13552122,13552385,13553015],"score":174,"time":1486051102,"title":"Introducing PureScript Erlang back end","type":"story","url":"http://nwolverson.uk/devlog/2016/08/01/introducing-purescript-erlang.html"},{"by":"tmaly","descendants":5,"id":13551410,"kids":[13551505,13551648],"score":3,"text":"I have used a short script and setup phone call interviews in the past for an idea.

The only thing is that bubbles happen and we may be seeing one in front of our eyes.<p>Or maybe I am just overthinking it?<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=O_dRGQCkPqk","time":1486001509,"title":"Are Netflix and other streaming services creating a content bubble?","type":"story"},{"by":"edgarvm","descendants":18,"id":13547402,"kids":[13548125,13550170,13548322,13548670,13549862,13548725,13550735,13550361,13550648,13548337,13549807],"score":257,"time":1486000516,"title":"Think OS: A Brief Introduction to Operating Systems","type":"story","url":"http://greenteapress.com/thinkos/"},{"by":"reacharavindh","descendants":2,"id":13547222,"kids":[13547963,13549431,13547964],"score":1,"text":"Fellow hackers,\nI am thinking of buying an used ipad pro to replace my scattered handwritten notes and hopes of using them as a portable device that I can use for meetings and discussions where I dont need to actively code.<p>Anybody here use IPad Pro (wih Apple Pencil) in any good usecases?","time":1485998628,"title":"Ask HN: Anybody here uses an iPad Pro as a personal device?","type":"story"},{"by":"ooronning","descendants":5,"id":13547348,"kids":[13548335,13552909],"score":33,"time":1486000011,"title":"How would Git handle a SHA-1 collision on a blob?","type":"story","url":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9392365/how-would-git-handle-a-sha-1-collision-on-a-blob"},{"by":"bkudria","descendants":13,"id":13547317,"kids":[13549884,13548208,13547874,13551441],"score":104,"time":1485999711,"title":"The beauty of mixed-radix bases","type":"story","url":"http://firefly.nu/2017/01/mixed-radix/"},{"by":"bootload","descendants":520,"id":13547089,"kids":[13547806,13547358,13547250,13547271,13547347,13549223,13548729,13548271,13547642,13547522,13550046,13550024,13547224,13547336,13547480,13547530,13547511,13547578,13547416,13549054,13547097,13547886,13547499,13547731,13548054,13547474,13547781,13547694,13547444,13547546,13563602,13547495,13548341,13559350,13547556,13548906,13547549,13547802,13554829,13549068,13548793,13559257,13548788,13551487,13547727,13549606,13582429,13549910,13548683,13547477,13547990,13547746,13547285,13547362,13547636,13547399,13547796,13547098,13548262,13547668,13547471],"score":556,"time":1485997020,"title":"How Children Lost the Right to Roam in Just 4 Generations","type":"story","url":"http://www.freerangekids.com/how-children-lost-the-right-to-roam-in-just-4-generations/"},{"by":"emilong","descendants":98,"id":13547010,"kids":[13547292,13547310,13547279,13547322,13547305,13547488,13547306,13547281,13547676,13547313,13549255,13547361,13547693,13547338,13547344,13547319,13547267,13547303,13547452,13547309,13547288],"score":90,"time":1485996307,"title":"Reddit bans Alt-Right Group","type":"story","url":"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/02/01/reddit-bans-alt-right-group.html"},{"by":"sunils34","descendants":2,"id":13546868,"kids":[13549529,13547058,13546888],"score":4,"time":1485995039,"title":"Made by Immigrants","type":"story","url":"http://madebyimmigrants.org"},{"by":"SligStorm","descendants":2,"id":13546819,"kids":[13546848,13547125],"score":2,"text":"I&#x27;m in a rather odd situation myself when it comes to attaining Visa&#x27;s.

I’ve since spent the last 2 years watching great apps struggle to be found and I’ve been trying to help them any way I could. I built app marketing tools, advertising platforms, and redesigned entire apps (for free) to help them, but the bigger problems became clear; the App Stores have mounting problems and aren’t built to make app developers succeed. I knew I could build something better.<p>Here’s what’s next for Neue Store; in the next few months we want to launch our Reviews and Ratings product and be Rotten Tomatoes for Apps. We believe reviews from credible, verified reviewers would be much more helpful for apps and consumers alike.\nAfter this, we have a few tricks up our sleeve for more tools to help apps and app consumers, including support for Android and VR apps.<p>It is with constant improvements, feedback from developers, and a superior store experience that we hope to build a better App Store altogether.<p>Happy to chat in the comments.

Unfortunately, the company I am with is neither in this space nor have any plans in the future to be in it hence I started to look around for jobs at other companies in this space. After 3 months in, I&#x27;m now feeling utterly perplexed.<p>I tried applying for lead&#x2F;architect roles and was rejected (without even going to the interview stage) being told that I don&#x27;t have enough experience or expertise. Fair point I guess since I&#x27;m in a niche industry thus I started looking at roles that allow me to start at the bottom (i.e. dev, support&#x2F;operations, customer success). Even then, I keep getting rejected with the common trope that I don&#x27;t have enough experience or I am either overqualified and&#x2F;or will not be a good fit for the team!<p>I asked my professional network for some inputs on the matter and I&#x27;ve been told that I&#x27;m in an age group (30-40) where companies are not that keen to hire cause I&#x27;m considered too old (ageism). Is this possible?

PHP&#x27;s huge advantage is that you can shop around for hosting from hundreds of hosting providers.

In general, I enjoy my job and think very highly of my employer.  Like most people in this salary range, though, I am stuck living in a crowded, gridlocked, high cost of living area, where most of my money goes to taxes and an small, cruddy house.  With my skills and work history, I think I could easily land a job at a major tech company or hedge fund and earn in the 300s, but my situation wouldn&#x27;t really improve because it would require moving to an even more expensive area and paying more taxes.  The older I get, the more I realize that the secret of success isn&#x27;t just earning good money, it&#x27;s doing so in a low cost of living area.  Therefore, I am wondering how likely it is to earn in the mid 100s doing full-time remote work in the embedded software field (specifically, real-time, high-reliability systems)?  Does anyone have any advice or personal experience developing a work-from-anywhere income stream in this field?

As some background I used to be a software engineer for a bit under two years then I moved into quant analytics then an investment&#x2F;front offices role. I’ve got a technical background with a masters in engineering &#x2F; maths and I’ve used Ubuntu, Java, Python and SQL. I’ve started to learn Node.JS<p>My idea would be to create an API-first company with a UI to help automate a process whereby information is currently being transferred by PDF and manually entered or outsourced. I think the idea is pretty good and as such I was thinking of starting a company with a co-founder (I still need to find one). I have some savings which we can use to buy a small house and my wife earns a modest income which could support us while I work on this project. The goal would be to fund to myself for a while then maybe get into Techstars followed by some VC&#x2F;Angel money when we had to.<p>The thing is that I have some savings and am fairly comfortable earning $150k+ in a role which I don’t think that I’m perfect for and I’m not using my technical skills. But I generally enjoy the work although I don’t think that my current career path has a great future…maybe I’m just glass half empty….<p>Starting a data&#x2F;software company seems to make sense and I have a workable idea. The thought of taking the leap terrifies me and excites me at the same time. So is doing a start-up all it’s cracked up to be? …. I know it’s a lot of work and I’m ready for it.<p>If it fails then what? I don’t want to go back to coding for someone else. I’d rather go back to the investment world…..<p>Any thoughts or advice would be more than welcome","time":1485539651,"title":"Ask HN: To Startup or not to Start-up?","type":"story"},{"by":"dsr12","descendants":2,"id":13501072,"kids":[13501403,13505436],"score":13,"time":1485537575,"title":"Apple and OpenAI join research group for ethical AI with fellow tech giants","type":"story","url":"http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/27/14411810/apple-joins-partnership-for-ai"},{"by":"mooreds","descendants":24,"id":13500883,"kids":[13502494,13501478,13501344,13502168,13501052,13503816,13501217,13501570],"score":66,"time":1485536055,"title":"“How” ages faster than “why”","type":"story","url":"https://hackernoon.com/how-ages-faster-than-why-712e25c9eb3b"},{"by":"drivas","descendants":9,"id":13500876,"kids":[13504619,13508559,13505021,13504658],"score":17,"time":1485536004,"title":"PayPal Has Been Talking with Amazon on Payments, CEO Says","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-27/paypal-talking-with-amazon-on-payments-business-paypal-ceo-says"},{"by":"petermcintyre","descendants":2,"id":13500704,"kids":[13500763,13500738,13500720],"score":3,"time":1485534650,"title":"Show HN: A course on concepts to make better decisions or at least sound smart","type":"story","url":"https://conceptually.org/"},{"by":"xando","descendants":76,"id":13500701,"kids":[13500705,13501120,13503662,13501390,13501051,13503411,13501971,13501888,13501397,13507309,13502226,13512985,13502170,13502413,13501929,13501761,13530492,13501549,13504963,13500943,13501997,13503923,13502606,13504850,13501218,13501141,13501866,13505961,13504021,13502600,13501386,13502147,13503619],"score":419,"time":1485534622,"title":"Show HN: Whoishiring.io – all tech jobs mapped out","type":"story","url":"https://whoishiring.io/"},{"by":"cagrimmett","descendants":10,"id":13500652,"kids":[13501156,13503796,13504665,13503930,13517409,13502255,13501084,13514397],"score":8,"text":"I wish more open source projects had a way to support them besides for working on the code base.
