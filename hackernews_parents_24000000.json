non-technical cofounder (who has majority share) won&#x27;t stop thinking of new features he wants us to deliver ASAP. The problem is, as we&#x27;ve kept building features, the system itself is getting less stable and we&#x27;ve accumulated cut corners over time to deliver ASAP. We (the engineers) have made it clear that we need to spend many weeks refactoring, adding tests, and doing other improvements if we want to get to a level where we can successfully land &amp; support a big customer.<p>Every time we find a stability issue &amp; figure out a fix, he asks for LOE and if we don&#x27;t say we can turn it around in a day or two he shoots it down and says we have too many features (which he just thought of in the last 2 weeks) to do.<p>On top of that, he is always promising to show current &amp; potential customers new features next week - features that haven&#x27;t even been started or thought out! So we scramble &amp; cut corners to get them demo-ready.<p>A few months ago, we pushed back pretty hard and said after our next milestone, we need time to pause features &amp; work on stability, and he said we would. Well, it&#x27;s been a few months and now there are documents and documents of new features we Need to build in order to be Successful. It&#x27;s getting harder to buy since half of the features we did build get little to no use.<p>So what can I do? Despite owning a large chunk of the company, it doesn&#x27;t feel like I have any say when it comes to how I spend my time and energy. I&#x27;m trying to bake adding tests, refactoring, etc into my Definition of Done for feature work (thus slowing down those features too.) But it feels like a piecemeal bandage.<p>I&#x27;ve read these threads on HN before and half the responses tend to be &quot;engineers obsess too much over quality - focus on delivering business value.&quot; Well, plenty of business value has been and is being delivered.

The problem is, as we&#x27;ve kept building features, the system itself is getting less stable and we&#x27;ve accumulated cut-corners over time to deliver ASAP. We (the engineers) have made it clear that we need to spend at least a month or two refactoring, adding tests, and doing other improvements if we want to get the product to a level where we can successfully land &amp; support a big customer.<p>Every time we find a stability issue &amp; figure out a fix, he asks for LOE - if we don&#x27;t say we can turn it around in a day or two he shoots it down and says we have too many features (which he just thought of to begin with in the last 2 weeks) to do.<p>A few months ago, we pushed back pretty hard and said after our next milestone, we need time to pause features &amp; work on stability, and he said we would. Well, it&#x27;s been a few months and now there are a bunch of new features we Need in order to be Successful.

HN,<p>I had a successful Show HN weeks ago of my product Serial Literature (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24307752). The core of it is emailing periodic installments of classic novels to subscribers.<p>I use Sendgrid for the email delivery and it is currently breaking my product. I have almost 1,000 subscribers already, which translates in about 200 emails to be delivered each day. Because I am on a free trial I am limited to 100 emails per day (their copy doesn&#x27;t say that, it says <i>&quot;Send 40,000 emails for 30 days, then 100&#x2F;day forever.&quot;</i>, implicitly saying that the daily limit is only after the 30-days period, but it&#x27;s not. I see both a warning in my dashboard saying I reached the 100-emails limit and can see my requests getting rejected after the ~100th request).<p>The catch is, Sendgrid also doesn&#x27;t allow me to upgrade! Is says my account is too young. I already opened 4 support tickets with them, to no answer at all! -- btw, they have a weird automation on their ticket system where I create a ticket with priority P1 (critical impact), as it is breaking my product, and they automatically change it to a P3 (general) right after I submit it. This is probably throwing all my requests to the end of the queue.<p>I just need the ability to upgrade! What should I do?<p>I am hoping to get some Sendgrid&#x27;s team replying appealing to the <i>&quot;HN as customer service&quot;</i> that I saw working before, which I think is on-topic since my only publication and traffic source is the Show HN I mentioned.<p>But if that doesn&#x27;t work, what should I do?

I apply to basic CRUD development roles, half of them entry level, and even there, the grilling has become intense, if I even get an interview.<p>I haven&#x27;t even applied to jobs for weeks now, because in interviews I feel like I&#x27;m getting humiliated and I want to apologize and end them half-way.<p>I&#x27;m sorry if this is incoherent.<p>I&#x27;m sure the problem is  me, since other people are doing fine. I need to draw a line and figure out some good indicators of when I should quit this industry, and anyone here who could give a few pointers on that, I would be thankful. I don&#x27;t want to throw more time and resources into an industry where baseline expectations are something I can&#x27;t&#x2F;won&#x27;t reach.","time":1599998815,"title":"Ask HN: Should I quit the

the account just to tell this story.<p>I am a brown man. I&#x27;ve been living in new york city for almost 8 years. Tonight, Saturday September 12th 2020, I have experienced something that does not happen in my life very often. I got a bit carried out on a Saturday event so i was so wasted, i fell in the subway car. I don&#x27;t remember much but i was laying down on the subway car floor while some white folks on top of me asking whether i was OK. Not only that, but while i was trying to collect myself to answer them, there was that other white dude offering me to sit in his seat. I was stoned of course, so i didn&#x27;t think so much. I just said thank you, i got up from the subway floor and sat down in his seat. I did say thank you though.\nWhat even crazier, a few mins later after i sat down, a person, who worked with the subway company, came to me asking whether i needed a medical assistant! I said no of course.<p>I just can&#x27;t be any more thankful to this city and to the folks who helped me. I am writing this post while i&#x27;m still under the same condition. I just got back home. And I so want to let the world know about this experience before i sleep and forget what just happened to me. \nMy point is i was so freaking laying down on the subway floor!!! i was so fucking wasted!!! And the only people who helped me and offered to help me, were white folks. I&#x27;m just so fucking thankful to them and to this city.<p>Stay safe everybody.","time":1599961315,"title":"A brown man laying down on NYC subway floor, helped by white guys","type":"story"},{"by":"zuhayeer","descendants":5,"id":24457325,"kids":[24457915,24458754,24458405,24458382,24458081],"score":15,"time":1599959154,"title":"The Virtual HQ for Your Remote Team","type":"story","url":"https://branch.gg/"},{"by":"beckingz","descendants":58,"id":24457347,"kids":[24458161,24461032,24457890,24458512,24458074,24461277,24458483,24458137,24461692,24459059,24458208,24458017,24458798],"score":84,"time":1599959451,"title":"The Spite Software License","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/voynix/spite-license"},{"by":"edgarvaldes","descendants":40,"id":24457310,"kids":[24457800,24457798,24458029,24458476,24457907,24458573,24463560,24466096,24457833,24457818,24458008,24458281],"score":97,"time":1599959035,"title":"You have turned Google Chrome into IE","type":"story","url":"https://twitter.com/ramsey/status/1304642404419538944"},{"by":"kristianpaul","descendants":526,"id":24457211,"kids":[24459319,24460213,24461264,24458107,24461541,24458365,24461016,24460670,24460313,24458175,24458917,24459652,24458224,24459034,24458233,24459375,24458374,24458227,24461375,24458101,24461523,24462052,24459924,24459641,24458165,24458221,24458647,24462212,24460253,24460297,24460469,24467135,24459395,24458213,24458733,24460987,24461526,24460916,24458103,24458075,24459537,24458619,24459978,24458243,24459598,24457937,24460843,24459678,24459152,24459064,24458004,24460805],"score":273,"time":1599957707,"title":"Ex-Google boss Eric Schmidt: US 'dropped the ball' on innovation","type":"story","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54100001"},{"by":"supernova87a","descendants":368,"id":24456797,"kids":[24457575,24457744,24460549,24457634,24457595,24460597,24457610,24457488,24458061,24460423,24463370,24457896,24457588,24460283,24457769,24462969,24457568,24457104,24459785,24457353,24457603,24459872,24459835,24457635,24457885,24457705,24457556,24457527],"score":152,"time":1599953219,"title":"CA Law Was to Give Uber Drivers New Protections.

We provide an education platform for kids aged 5-10 to learn intriguing concepts through interactive Live Instruction!<p>Now more than ever, we know parents are stressed out. We want to help you buy back 30 minutes of your day to enjoy a sip of coffee, nap or work! Your kids can learn about the dirty jobs of the middle ages, or learning what is money whilst you sip away on a tea with a book -- and its content you can trust!<p>We’ve come from the realm of extracurricular education -- prior to testing this, we use to run a robotics&#x2F;programming camp where we taught students to learn languages such as C#, JS etc through projects and have them compete at university hackathons -- and win :) When COVID hit we had to shut down and it was pretty brutal -- especially because we were so used to teaching students in person.<p>I was then helping my sister out taking care of her 3 year old daughter -- and I realized working from home as a parent is a terrible endeavour. We realized in order to buy time for meetings, coffee or just a short bit of alone time we needed to create something educational, engaging&#x2F;interactive and well.... not youtube. Also, easy for the parents to use :)<p>We’ve built and released our BETA via TestFlight&#x2F;TestFairy (3 Weeks!) in hopes to generate as many testers and we hope to keep you entertained by our weekly patches and new content!<p>We run at 4pm EST on Mon&#x2F;Wed&#x2F;Fri (Let us know if you want us in your time zone!): hello@thinkstation.ca \nOur FREE BETA version is available via: beta.thinkstation.io&#x2F;download<p>This release includes:<p>-Live Stream Videos at 4pm EST Mon&#x2F;Wed&#x2F;Fri<p>-Individual Student Accounts<p>-COPPA compliant chat features!<p>Also, you are more than welcome to share amongst your family and friends!<p>This our first time posting in this community and look forward to all of your feedback!<p>PS.

I&#x27;ve come to realize I&#x27;m not very good at it and thats unlikely to change. I have basically no CS knowledge and am not even really that great with the &quot;practical&quot; stuff despite having been at it for so long. There&#x27;s not a single language I&#x27;d consider myself good with, maybe one or two I can write and maybe one I&#x27;m ok with. I can read most code and I suppose consider myself well read when it comes to tech in general, in that I have very surface level familiarity with all sorts of things many most people have never heard of, although I must stress the &quot;surface level&quot; part. Its good for temporarily sounding smart or experienced, but most of that however is unfortunately useless. I can recall my last interview tripping up on questions about very basic OOP concepts, which you&#x27;d think I&#x27;d have internalized now and there&#x27;s no way in hell I&#x27;d make it past a phone screen for your average whiteboarding company. I know many people much less experienced or even relatively new who are significantly better at this. I suppose that some people are simply more intelligent or at least more inclined to the proper skills than myslef, which isnt neccesarily good or bad, more of just a fact. I also suppose that I&#x27;m an ok &quot;hacker&quot; in that I can get very interested &#x2F; fixated on certain problems, although my solution is more likely to be a complete mess.<p>Main problem is I&#x27;m not sure what quite to do about it. I&#x27;m not sure this is a &quot;try harder&quot; type solution, as I&#x27;ve been at it much too long for brute forcing to be realistic, but most of the alternatives seem dreadful.

My co-founder Lucas Playford and I are launching (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openunit.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openunit.com</a>) - software for managing self-storage facilities.<p>Lucas and I met 5 years ago at a startup in Toronto. Since leaving the startup, we’ve been looking for ways to “get the band back together” ever since. I would hack on side projects, such as an order-ahead food app and applicant tracking system for recruiting tech employees, but most of these fizzled out after a few weeks.<p>Despite our best efforts to get something started, we quickly realized that good startup ideas don&#x27;t just happen out of nowhere. Or do they? 12 months ago my landlord came to me with an offer: they wanted to sell the place I was renting, and they’d give me a surprising amount of money if I could be out with just a few days notice. Pulling that off though meant finding somewhere to keep all of my stuff while I looked for a new place to live. Within the first hour of searching, I discovered how antiquated the process of finding and booking self-storage is.<p>After digging in, I found that for many facility owners having the time, technical skills, and frankly, money, to piece together a system that lets customers rent online, is hard. If you’ve ever tried to find self storage yourself, you probably noticed that many of the small operators have horrendous websites that are slow, non-responsive, and don’t give you the ability to rent without picking up the phone. After talking to self storage owners directly, I also learned that they spend hours every single day doing back-office work that really should, and could be automated.<p>Since I was actively working on side projects, and I had just had this terrible experience trying to rent a storage unit, I decided to focus my time diving even further into the self-storage industry. I took time to research the tech used in the industry and connected directly with storage facility owners and operators to get a better understanding of the pain points of this large and, what appeared to be, technologically-backwards industry. Wanting to take the idea of “building something people want” a bit more seriously, I joined the Y Combinator’s online Startup School program (before it became a Continuous Program) to work more formally on what would later become OpenUnit. After Startup School, I was invited to take this idea out to Mountain View for an interview with YC. Two months later Lucas and I had quit our jobs, the band was back together, and we were on our way to California.<p>The initial idea was to build a marketplace that makes it easy for people to find and instantly rent a storage unit online. But after speaking with more storage operators and hearing the same themes over and over again, we thought, why not be even more ambitious? Why not build a product that solves the problems of the renters AND facility owners? It turns out that self-storage generates $48 billion in rental revenue a year. But, while you might see big players - Public Storage, Extra Space, CubeSmart etc. — in downtown cores, 74% of all self storage facilities are small and self-reliant. And they can’t afford expensive software.<p>As a result, the bad software they end up using creates terrible business inefficiencies and a lackluster customer experience. When I rented my storage unit, I experienced this firsthand. For the most part, large enterprises can spend enough money patching together systems to deliver an acceptable customer experience. But, for mom-and-pop operations, that is done with shoe leather - or it’s not done at all. Instead of just building a marketplace, we were going to build a truly affordable, all-in-one management ecosystem.<p>So here we are. We provide self-storage facilities exactly what they need — merchant solutions, lease agreements, websites and more to provide an amazing customer experience. We designed OpenUnit so that a typical facility can get up and running fast and with zero paperwork. We also tailored the features we’re offering to meet the unique needs of small operators first. As a result of this, our hope is that the entire experience is less overwhelming than competing management tools. Our enterprise package for facilities with &gt;5 properties is 15% more affordable than anything else we’ve seen in the market and customers get a lot more than what’s included with the other storage solutions.<p>Surprisingly, we&#x27;re seeing an increased level of interest due to coronavirus. Many operators and facilities are looking to adopt a contactless move-in process (think eSignatures for rental agreements, with customers managing their own profiles&#x2F;information and payment methods), which is something we’ve kept in-mind, and can be accomplished out of the box with OpenUnit, keeping employees and customers safe.<p>As a team, we’re firmly focused on the web: the core technology that powers our applications on all platforms. It’s hard to pin down a name for this stack, but it’s a majestic monolith, built using Ruby on Rails. We embrace a “HTML over the wire” architecture, of server-rendered HTML, and “sprinkle” bits of interactive JavaScript. Season with Redis and ElasticSearch, we should have all we’ll ever need. For the foreseeable future anyways. We’re taking a privacy-first approach to customer data and use lockbox, which aims to make encryption as friendly and intuitive as possible for Rails.<p>If you have experience or if you have close friends, relatives, or colleagues that are in the storage space, please reach out! We&#x27;re keen to get the community&#x27;s input, in the comments below or at hn@openunit.com. After reading this, don’t be surprised if you start to notice the number of self-storage facilities in your city.<p>Thanks so much, and we can’t wait to hear your thoughts!","time":1599750577,"title":"Launch HN: OpenUnit (YC W20) – Software for managing self-storage facilities","type":"story"},{"by":"andriosr","descendants":33,"id":24432939,"kids":[24432951,24452661,24434371,24433682,24433698],"score":125,"time":1599749928,"title":"Show HN: An open-source financial ledger API written in Clojure","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/decimals/sequence"},{"by":"tenderlove","descendants":62,"id":24432930,"kids":[24435166,24433642,24434374,24433598,24433984,24439315,24433632,24433589,24434474,24434515,24436810,24433755,24434508,24437782,24433562,24433866,24434676,24435949,24433541,24441372,24434839,24434553,24433519,24434378,24434152],"score":265,"time":1599749890,"title":"Analog Terminal Bell","type":"story","url":"http://analogterminalbell.com"},{"by":"shadow_s","descendants":3,"id":24432645,"kids":[24432652,24437802],"score":4,"time":1599747933,"title":"Show HN: Diffchecker – Find the differences between text files, images or PDFs","type":"story","url":"https://www.diffchecker.com/"},{"by":"brundolf","descendants":12,"id":24432635,"kids":[24432860,24436706,24434916,24432887,24432754,24433044,24433468],"score":11,"time":1599747877,"title":"Trying to fix my Linux graphics issues","type":"story","url":"https://twitter.com/fasterthanlime/status/1303738588883046405"},{"by":"appleflaxen","descendants":4,"id":24432583,"kids":[24436998,24432719,24432744],"score":2,"text":"What&#x27;s the easiest language to use if I need to convert an arbitrary file format into variables in memory?

We’re building a healthy alternative to Youtube that entertains and educates kids (4-10) with interactive lessons—starting with science!<p>Tappity’s story began ten years ago when I developed an app for my Biology professor to teach kids about evolution. It was my first time building a product for kids, so I learned a ton about designing for an audience who couldn’t read or sit still for very long. Also, their brutally honest feedback was refreshing! We ended up getting 20,000 downloads, and I learned kids <i>love</i> interactions. After that great experience, I continued to create apps for kids on the side for fun.<p>About two years ago, parents started paying for one of these apps. Kids loved a segment we had shot on a whim at our friend’s house, in which they could interact with a real live science teacher. Parents were excited, too. We gave them something engaging, fun, and educational for their kids, which is shockingly rare. The sad reality is that 99% of kids apps fall into three buckets: ad-riddled games, cheap &amp; buggy ABC&#x2F;123 apps, or YouTube. We wanted to do better. Shortly thereafter, Lawrence and I quit our jobs (where we had met) to start Tappity!<p>We leaned into this idea of live-like experiences. We felt it’d enrich screen time without sacrificing the fun. So, with Tappity, kids don’t just passively watch, they play along and direct our live-action characters on screen. For example, you could tell Haley—our version of Bill Nye—what she should do next in her science experiment, and she would actually do what you say. Unlike traditional TV programs or videos, where you know the person on screen is talking to a million other people, Tappity makes it feel like characters are interacting with <i>just</i> you in real time. Turns out, this format is super engaging. Best of all, kids don’t feel like they’re learning—they tell their parents they&#x27;re hanging out with Haley!<p>So far, we’ve produced ~40 hours of original content, and we’re rapidly building out our library. While we shot much of our content initially with an iPhone in my garage, we’ve now graduated to filming with an actual crew at a studio in Los Angeles!<p>We&#x27;re excited to share Tappity with the wider HN community, especially those of you with younger kids. With many families still spending a lot of time at home, we&#x27;re hoping to make at-home learning a bit more fun and bearable. You can download it for free on the App Store [1]. Would love to hear what you think!<p>Chad, Lawrence, &amp; Tanner<p>P.S.

The other side of me says that it’s not PHP, the language, that is problematic, it’s simply _how_ it is used; for example, PHP frameworks—although useful and serve a purpose—don’t really result in less debugging time nor do they make code more literate or smaller in scope.<p>So the question I pose is: A. Should PHP as a language be augmented, like TS does for JS, or B. Should the community focus on the methodology of PHP to make development simpler? What are some concrete propositions you can imagine that argue for either case?<p>I think any PHP developer can propose more than one new feature they would like to see.

This is challenging because my current job is far removed from distributed systems.<p>Here is my current plan:\n- Set up 1:1 chats with hiring managers to better understand what their engineers do, and what they are looking for.

A social event would be going to the bar, house party, or meeting up for coffee. You can fill out a simple form (event name, description, date, time) and post to a feed for your friends to see. Your friends can notify you they&#x27;re going by pressing the &quot;attend&quot; button.<p>Right now I&#x27;m trying to solve the communication problem. Everyday you might meet up with your friends at the bar after work, invite them to lunch, coffee in the morning, or dinner in the afternoon. But you have to do the dance. You text everyone who you want to come, wait for them to reply and they may not even want to go. And for each person you invite you have to do the dance longer. This has many times wasted over an hour for me.<p>So I propose a faster solution. If you want your friends to meet you at the bar, create an &quot;Event&quot;. The event has a title of what the event is (e.g. &quot;Going to the bar&quot;). It has a description to get your friends excited (e.g. &quot;$2 margaritas&quot;). It has the address (e.g. &quot;123 SomeBar St.&quot;). Lastly it has the time (e.g. &quot;Tonight at 8pm&quot;). As soon as you post it to the feed all of your friends get a notification that you just created a new event. They can then all tell you if they are going by hitting the &quot;attend&quot; button.<p>Now I&#x27;m trying to get my first users. Yesterday was my first day. I made a spreadsheet of everyone I can message that live in my target area. My list is 82 people. Yesterday I contacted 24 people and got one person to sign up, I was hoping to get five. But most of the people I messaged didn&#x27;t even respond.<p>It&#x27;s definitely a grind. I was wondering if anyone has any tips on how they got some of their first users. What was it like? Or any stories of how they got their first signs of growth.<p>Also if you have this problem I could really use some feedback on my app. You can check it out by searching &quot;bbook.io&quot; in the Apple App Store.<p>Thank you guys for reading!\nRyan Sam","time":1599340915,"title":"Getting Users Is Hard","type":"story"},{"by":"panic","descendants":58,"id":24386867,"kids":[24388060,24388576,24388507,24387871,24388089,24388149,24387839,24388654,24387612,24389029,24387495,24387916,24387827,24390937],"score":119,"time":1599340235,"title":"I can't believe I'm praising Tcl (2008)","type":"story","url":"http://yosefk.com/blog/i-cant-believe-im-praising-tcl.html"},{"by":"tekknolagi","descendants":29,"id":24386826,"kids":[24387175,24386829,24390771,24387166,24389970,24387605,24388688],"score":126,"time":1599339827,"title":"Compiling a Lisp to x86-64: primitive functions","type":"story","url":"https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-4/"},{"by":"Thevet","descendants":23,"id":24386759,"kids":[24420601,24420424,24421115,24421873,24426330,24420832,24420908,24426472,24421162,24423000],"score":119,"time":1599339099,"title":"Northwestern Point of the Lake of the Woods","type":"story","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_point_of_the_Lake_of_the_Woods"},{"by":"thescribbblr","descendants":5,"id":24386755,"kids":[24387157,24386787],"score":4,"time":1599339058,"title":"Ask HN: Custom Website vs. WordPress Website ranking problem?","type":"story"},{"by":"drummer","descendants":21,"id":24386700,"kids":[24387501,24388710,24388766,24393606,24387608,24387701,24387677],"score":47,"time":1599338504,"title":"What anarchy isn't (free eBook)","type":"story","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/yd18waixbva1jae/WhatAnarchyIsnt-FREEBIE.pdf?dl=0"},{"by":"kareemm","descendants":13,"id":24386678,"kids":[24387693,24387129,24386931,24391917,24387733,24417945,24388681,24387709],"score":17,"time":1599338265,"title":"Why only fools write code first","type":"story","url":"https://www.reemer.com/articles/why-only-fools-write-code-first"},{"by":"beefman","descendants":42,"id":24386584,"kids":[24387089,24390640,24387590,24390011,24386997,24386916,24391473,24390260,24387314,24387311],"score":222,"time":1599337407,"title":"Traffic Prediction with Advanced Graph Neural Networks","type":"story","url":"https://deepmind.com/blog/article/traffic-prediction-with-advanced-graph-neural-networks"},{"by":"enthdegree","descendants":2,"id":24386530,"kids":[24393300,24394814,24394803],"score":4,"text":"From the outside I&#x27;ve always seen the field of sustainable food and artificial meat production as extremely important but am not aware of any ways someone with my skills can contribute to it.

My passion has always been physics but unfortunately to pay off loans&#x2F;medical bills&#x2F;etc I was more or less forced into software engineering.<p>I took the standard undergrad physics &#x27;core curriculum&#x27; in college (e.g. Griffiths quantum, e&amp;m, K&amp;K mechanics, etc). I&#x27;ve been keeping up with my studies since then by slowly working my way through various &#x27;graduate texts&#x27;, e.g. Sakurai&#x27;s text on quantum mechanics and Kardar&#x27;s on statistical physics of particles.<p>I&#x27;d like to do some side work in an experimental quantum computing lab and have been in contact with various universities; however, what I&#x27;m finding is that there&#x27;s a large gap between the material in the papers being read and written by the groups I&#x27;ve spoken with, and my formal education. The papers are constantly referencing ideas, equations, and experiments that went unreferenced in all the texts I&#x27;ve read thus far. Trying to Google and understand these ideas and experiments one-by-one from Wikipedia and articles has been inefficient and ineffective so far for me.<p>Moreover, since I have no university affiliation, it seems like these groups are not particularly motivated to help me bridge that gap; I have not received much in the way of advice in terms of getting up to speed.<p>Has anyone else experienced and&#x2F;or solved this problem? Ideally I&#x27;d like to be able to (a) understand at a high-level the current state of the field, since there seem to be a myriad of different research directions all aimed more or less at the same objective, and (b) understand open problems for at least one of these directions (e.g. open problems in quantum dots or ion traps).","time":1599256147,"title":"Ask HN: Bridging the gap between formal physics education and research?","type":"story"},{"by":"sam-hedron","descendants":2,"id":24379125,"kids":[24379232,24379811],"score":3,"time":1599255379,"title":"Show HN: Evolution of VR Headsets","type":"story","url":"https://twitter.com/hedronvision/status/1301997023265271813"},{"by":"ColanR","descendants":2,"id":24379066,"kids":[24379815,24379071],"score":5,"time":1599254954,"title":"USC Suspends Comm.

Slapdash lets you work across all of your cloud apps at desktop speed, sort of like an OS for cloud apps.<p>We have built a uniform, low-latency data browser (kind of like Finder) as well as a unified command line-like interface (kind of like Spotlight) for the applications you use at work.<p>When we left our big company jobs, one of the difficult things to part with was the tooling. Companies like Facebook and Stripe build a class of tools internally that unifies all the employees and any collaboration apps, so you can find anyone or anything the company knows. Everything is just a quick search away [0]. It’s quite a useful way to work. Common questions in day-to-day work are easy to answer. What’s the history of this code abstraction? What are my colleagues working on? What’s the story with this customer?<p>Building such a system today means connecting people&#x27;s cloud apps, because that&#x27;s where most of the work is happening today. Even for a small team like us, our work spans Drive, Dropbox, Figma, GitHub, Asana, Notion, Docusign, Slack, Quip, etc.<p>The first thing we built was a low-latency file system for cloud apps. You connect an application like Drive, or GitHub to Slapdash and we give you a way to search and browse the data in a uniform interface (kind of like Finder). It turns your working world into a database you can easily query.<p>We modeled our file system as a graph and we built our architecture to match, with a focus on performance. We built an import system, which effectively solves a graph replication problem (translating the structure of the app data to the Slapdash graph and keeping it in sync). We then built a graph database on top of Postgres, added a data access layer with graph semantics, with GraphQL API delivering the data to the client.<p>Of course, the data we store is encrypted on disk, in-transit and in the data store. Slapdash employees can&#x27;t see the contents of what we index since everything except the reverse index is encrypted. It’s not zero-access yet, but we’re building in that direction [1].<p>What we discovered is that by applying optimizations to how we store (sharding &amp; colocation) and retrieve data (batching &amp; coalescing) we could achieve an almost zero-latency [2] experience when browsing application data. As a result, it&#x27;s much faster to browse Google Drive in Slapdash than in the Drive interface itself.<p>While the low-latency file system is interesting, we learned that being able to search and navigate is not enough utility for a single individual. People don’t search as much as they think they do, and most have their unique information foraging habits that work well-enough.<p>However, we wanted Slapdash to be useful for anyone, not just an employee at a big company, so we turned our attention to building a new experience on top of the file system. Our goal was to take a leap in speed with which people can control their computers. We thought this was possible because the difference in UX between desktop and cloud app environments was so acute: the desktop OS is principled, integrated and fast, while cloud apps are latency-laden and confined to crowded browser tabs.<p>To that end, we built the Command Bar (Command Line + Search Bar). The Command Bar is best experienced as a desktop app, where it’s invoked with a global shortcut. You can quickly search your apps, file tasks, peek at your calendar, create zoom meetings, etc: all with a couple of keystrokes. Of course, you can also write your own commands too.<p>In practice, it meaningfully cuts down the time you spend controlling the computer. For example, filing a task on GitHub might take 10 seconds of just navigating to the right screen, while you can start writing the task title within 2 seconds by invoking the &quot;Create New GitHub Issue&quot; command with the Command Bar. Things like searching for a customer record, doing a quick spreadsheet calculation and even routine things like opening an existing document are measurably faster. [3]<p>For teams and companies, Slapdash provides a unified interface to a team’s collective knowledge. This has traditionally been reserved for top technology companies, but we are bringing these advantages to everybody else. And for the individual, we are making the use of disparate cloud apps feel closer to the classic experience of a desktop computer OS - fast, integrated and more productive.<p>We are still figuring out what apps to support, what commands we should build and how we can open up the platform for others to build on as well.

Changing the prototype has become more and more difficult and there are some aspects of dash that I&#x27;m not very happy with:<p>Poor separation of front end and back end code, Mix of Python and JS&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;CSS, No support for mobile, Difficult to extend (e.g. integrating maps was painful)<p>The bottom line is, it all feels like we have reached the limits of our current technology stack and we should start from scratch with more suitable technology.<p>So I went out to see how web apps are done &quot;properly&quot; in 2020. Separating front end and back end is a very obvious first step. The back end technology is also very easy to pick. But the technologies and trends regarding front end are just overwhelming for me. I&#x27;ve read&#x2F;watched multiple guides on the topic (e.g. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;0pThnRneDjw) and they all present multiple areas (UI, CSS, transpiler, database, etc.) from which one library&#x2F;framework&#x2F;etc. must be chosen.<p>I&#x27;m looking for a as-small-as-possible subset of these technologies that is strong in the following areas:\nMaintainability: This is the number one priority. The code must be easy to change, extend and debug. Extensibility: Plays well with new libraries&#x2F;technologies. Easy to learn.

It&#x27;s actually fun writing stuff in the React declarative style.<p>My setup consists of a Flask server which js bundles for SPAs. The Flask server also exposes REST endpoints which the SPA uses to load and save data in the backend.<p>Recently, I&#x27;ve been running into a couple of problems:<p>1. Mapping from what you see into the React code.<p>When developing static HTML pages, you can just use Inspect Element in Firefox to see how the elements on the page map to your HTML code. If you&#x27;re using templates, the templates map pretty closely to the outputted HTML. e.g. this &lt;div&gt; in my template shows as a &lt;div&gt; in the final HTML. This is not true of React. I can&#x27;t easily map the components I have in my .jsx files to the outputted HTML. I find that this increases cognitive load by a fair amount, since I need to keep the entire structure of my SPA in my head when I think to figure out where the code affecting a particular component lives.<p>2. Boring data handling.<p>Say I want to have a database of cars and I want to build a frontend that lets people add cars.<p>Now, I have a Car table in my backend database, I have a Car object serverside and I have a Car component in React. Writing this repetitive code is super boring, tedious and time consuming. Frameworks such as Flask or Django come with some ORM solutions which can autogen the HTML for your frontend, deal with marshalling data from clientside to serverside and also let you easily commit to your backend db.<p>So, 2 questions:<p>1. Is there an equivalent for Inspect Element for React?\n2. Is there some sort of ORM solution for React?<p>Also, any tips or materials you have on React would also come in handy.","time":1598908876,"title":"Ask HN: React

have been running my company in the UK for almost a decade now, living there for most of that time. With the world going through kind of a rough patch at the moment, and the UK in particular, I am trying to prepare for what&#x27;s next. We&#x27;re hoping to move away soon (still unclear where to, however), but it will most likely be within the EU (I have an EU passport). My home country (not the UK) is a bit of a disaster for small companies, and I don&#x27;t trust the UK gov enough to figure a way out of the situation anytime soon. So... seeing all the big corps have (for tax and EU reasons mostly) incorporated in Ireland, I wondered what the status quo is for non-resident company formation there. I&#x27;ve heard many things over the years, and apparently a lot has changed (improved) recently, too. I&#x27;ve also had a company incorporated with Stripe Atlas before in the US, but managing the whole Delaware tax&#x2F;franchise thing remotely was a bit much for a one-man-contract-shop kind of operation. Ideally I&#x27;d like to be as close as possible to what the UK limited format was, as that allowed me to keep myself separate from the company, legally, and it helped tremendously in managing taxes so that a super large short-term project won&#x27;t take me out financially.<p>Long story short: anyone (non-resident) recently incorporated in Ireland, perhaps even doing contract work for (mostly) EU companies and&#x2F;or having revenue come in from SaaS subscription products?

My name is Advait and I co-founded SuperTokens along with\n@rishabhpoddar (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supertokens.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supertokens.io&#x2F;</a>). SuperTokens helps companies\nsecurely manage their session tokens, saving developer time and\npreventing identity theft.<p>We started SuperTokens 1.5 years ago when we were building a consumer\napp and wanted our users to be logged in for a long time in a secure\nway. When it came to managing user sessions, there was a lot of\nambiguity. We read many forums (Reddit, Stackoverflow) and blogs, and\nfound that developers were arguing about best practices, such as using\nlocal storage vs cookies, implementing JWTs, etc. We had to do a lot\nof the first principles thinking ourselves to understand the\ntradeoffs. Around the same time, Facebook, Docker, Gitlab, Youtube,\nUber were in the news for session vulnerabilities.<p>Stealing a user’s session allows you to access their account as if you\nhad their username and password. Hence being able to mitigate against\nthis is important. We’ve audited companies and found large session\nvulnerabilities that they were not aware of. For a YC company, we were\nable to pull information on users that we shouldn’t have had access to.<p>Through our research, we built something internally and decided to\nwrite a blog post [1] explaining how our system works. While\nSuperTokens is not currently open source, you can see the original\ncodebase on Github [2].<p>Building a good solution for sessions requires a lot of specialised\nknowledge and time that could otherwise be spent on building your core\nbusiness logic. Detecting session theft reliably is difficult. There\nare multiple race conditions, edge cases and network issues that need\nto be thought about. In fact, one of our libraries that solves a\ndifficult race condition has 100K downloads &#x2F; week and is even used by\nAuth0 [3]<p>SuperToken mitigates against all session attacks (XSS, CSRF, etc) by\nimplementing best practices. For a full list of types of attacks with\nreal life examples please see [4]. However, it is not possible to\nmitigate against all attacks (for eg: social engineering) and hence,\nSuperTokens is also able to detect session theft. We use rotating\nrefresh tokens as per the official OAuth specifications in RFC 6819\n[5]. Auth0 has also started offering this, but due to their setup,\nthey cannot use httpOnly cookies to store these tokens and this goes\nagainst popular compliance recommendations.<p>Besides security, SuperTokens also offers improved API performance and\ndeveloper convenience. For clustered and distributed environments,\nsession verification for each API takes &lt; 1 millisecond. You can get a\nuser’s ID and access role without any database lookup. SuperTokens can\nbe implemented in 15 minutes, provides a simple API and has clear\ndocumentation. We abstract away complexities of token management by\nproviding frontend and backend SDKs.<p>In the coming months we plan to offer Access Control, Internal Auth\nbetween services and for internal tools (i.e. recent Twitter hack was\nthrough unauthorized access to an internal tool), and more! We&#x27;re\nstill experimenting with pricing, so you won&#x27;t find this on our\nwebsite, but we&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts about it.<p>Thank you for reading! We’d love to hear what this community\nspecifically has to say and if you have any experience dealing with\nthis. We’d appreciate any feedback!<p>----------<p>Footnotes:<p>[1] - Blog post: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;hackernoon&#x2F;all-you-need-to-know-about-user-session-security-ee5245e6bdad\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;hackernoon&#x2F;all-you-need-to-know-about-use...</a><p>[2] - Github: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;supertokens&#x2F;supertokens-core\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;supertokens&#x2F;supertokens-core</a><p>[3] - Library used by Auth0: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;browser-tabs-lock\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;browser-tabs-lock</a><p>[4] - List of attacks: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supertokens.io&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;attackshomepagev1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supertokens.io&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;attackshomepagev1</a><p>[5] - OAuth RFC 6819: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc6819#section-5.2.2.3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc6819#section-5.2.2.3</a>","time":1598630887,"title":"Launch HN: SuperTokens (YC S20) – Securely manage session tokens","type":"story"},{"by":"PatrolX","descendants":54,"id":24306511,"kids":[24307759,24306873,24307510,24306965,24307627,24307736,24307271,24307026],"score":42,"time":1598630596,"title":"Chainalysis in Action: Justice Dept Demands Forfeiture of 280 Crypto Addresses","type":"story","url":"https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/lazarus-group-north-korea-doj-complaint-august-2020"},{"by":"hliyan","descendants":99,"id":24306438,"kids":[24307195,24307838,24307044,24307106,24307532,24310428,24307409,24307287,24307541,24307708,24307618,24307219],"score":68,"time":1598630361,"title":"‘Surge Capacity’ Is Depleted – It’s Why You Feel Awful","type":"story","url":"https://elemental.medium.com/your-surge-capacity-is-depleted-it-s-why-you-feel-awful-de285d542f4c"},{"by":"datway","descendants":2,"id":24306154,"kids":[24310765,24306291,24306337],"score":7,"time":1598629219,"title":"Preliminary Summary of the FAA’s Review of the Boeing 737 Max [pdf]","type":"story","url":"https://www.faa.gov/news/media/attachments/737-MAX-RTS-Preliminary-Summary-v-1.pdf"},{"by":"jfdi","descendants":3,"id":24306128,"kids":[24306349,24314356,24306330],"score":1,"text":"Do you know of any tool that could enable this use case?<p>Essentially you insert a sufficiently high capacity USB stick into your laptop, entirely clone the drive encryption &amp; all as appropriate so that the USB stick becomes a full clone of your system, bootable from any other PC.","time":1598629131,"title":"Ask HN: Insert USB drive, image entire HD to USB so USB is bootable clone?","type":"story"},{"by":"aloukissas","descendants":9,"id":24306029,"kids":[24306317,24306199,24314018,24308914,24309596,24319080],"score":10,"text":"Hi HN community!

The produced demineralized or ultra pure waters are in contact with air entering the tank from the vent line due to the change of the water level in the tanks where they are stored.<p>When they come into contact with air, the CO2 gas in it dissolves and becomes ion in water. CO2, which is removed from the content in the production of demineralized water, is dissolved again in the water by air contact. It cause the pH parameter to fluctuate. This may cause demineralized water to fail to meet desired quality requirements.<p>On average, there is more than 400 ppm of carbon dioxide in the air. If your demineralized or pure water tank is atmospheric, it is quite natural that CO2 will affect pH and conductivity values.<p>CO2 Absorber Units allow you to maintain the pH and conductivity values of your demineralized water stored. It can be mounted on storage tanks, it can also be placed on the ground by pipeline if desired. The highly efficient and long-lasting filtration media in the absorber unit prevents CO2 from coming into contact by holding the CO2 gas in the air entering the tank. Since this filtration media is also equipped with a color indicator, when it reaches the maximum amount of CO2 it can absorb, the color of the media changes and the filter cartridges are replaced. The air inlet and outlet of the unit are safely provided with pressure and vacuum safety valves, differential pressure sensors &#x2F; switches. Dust particles that can come from outside are also captured with filters, thus preventing organic pollution that may occur in the tank.<p>Sizing and design of the  CO2 Absorber Units are made by examining the operating data of the storage tanks, so that unnecessary costs are prevented with the units manufactured for each facility. \nSuited Vessels\n• Demineralized water storge vessels\n• Ultra Pure water tanks\n• Desalinated water tanks","time":1598622861,"title":"CO2 Absorber Units","type":"story"},{"by":"blnqr","descendants":6,"id":24304873,"kids":[24305534,24305513,24304930,24304968],"score":11,"time":1598623052,"title":"Pandemic Making College Students Question the Price of Their Education","type":"story","url":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-coronavirus-pandemic-is-making-college-students-question-the-price-of-their-education-11598619781"},{"by":"keiferski","descendants":156,"id":24304799,"kids":[24306369,24305970,24305416,24305671,24305423,24306916,24307622,24306731,24309233,24312236,24307659,24305333,24306432,24309265,24306294,24309988,24310233,24306984,24305556,24314470,24305398,24306537,24305550,24306443,24306371,24307813,24310421,24307468,24306285,24305565,24306315,24308316,24307038,24308045],"score":146,"time":1598622739,"title":"Is Cyberpunk Dead?

Long time lurker, first-time poster. I&#x27;ve worked at companies for the better part of 20 years in the IT&#x2F;software area.  I&#x27;m a productivity fanatic, and recently I had an epiphany around a way to make people more productive.<p>Despite todo lists, Asana, Github, JIRA, Workast, Trello, butcher paper, and who knows what else - I spend countless hours in meetings where people give each other things to do.  Sometimes people write them down; sometimes they don&#x27;t.  Sometimes there is an email follow-up, and sometimes if there is a program manager, they put it on a spreadsheet.  Inevitably, what ends up happening is a human being has to send an email, Slack, call a meeting and ask - &quot;Are we on track?,&quot; &quot;Is this done?&quot; and so on.<p>The problem with many lists&#x2F;tickets&#x2F;task systems, I think, is that they are focused on the capture, but not the delegation.<p>What if there was a system that would do the nagging for you, and when you give someone something to do, it attempts to suggest what&#x27;s a reasonable due date or reassigns the tasks to someone else?  What if the system plays the middle-person in terms of resetting expectations, by prompting the person executing the task if they can do it, and when?  And in between checks in with the person to see if they are on track?  The system would also keep all parties informed.<p>Do you think this would be useful?<p>I&#x27;d build it much like how operating systems work.  Instead of threads, the backend would model people, each with their load.  The system would basically act as a scheduler, and recommend when a thread (person) is overloaded, and similarly check on each thread for health.  I want to build a virtual operating system for how work gets done by focusing on the inter-process communication between the people in a company.<p>If you think this idea has legs - how would it work best for you in practice?  How could you get other people to adopt it?<p>Thank you, and I look forward to your feedback!","time":1598556312,"title":"An idea to end “follow-ups” at

What is the key criteria or realisation point where I am able to work a job as a professional Frontend Developer?<p>2. The more I learn JS, I realise the lesser I know and there is much more I need to cover. Some days, feeling of being a false positive kicks in and I start to believe that I am a fake and is not ready for a junior position even. This barrier tends to grow in day by day.<p>3. The decision to spend more time on learning technology and building personal projects solely over a longer period of time costed me on soft skills part and making connections. Is being an extraordinary articulator or good salesman a new vital facet of a Frontend developer?<p>4. Having a likening for CSS in JS world, or getting generalised by “UX Developer” not “Software Developer”, Does it lower the chances of being employable in current market (even though, you as a candidate are willing to learn React ecosystem but where is the line for a self-taught developer: design patterns, hooks, context, redux, saga, reselect, custom webpack bundling, flux, typescript, unit testing, jest)?<p>5. I have interest in CS and Maths but no clue on how these two fields amalgamate and what pathways from Frontend lead to them?

PuffinBASIC is an implementation of the BASIC language specification. PuffinBASIC conforms most closely to GWBASIC.<p>The purpose of this implementation is to learn how to write interpreters and resurrect an old programming language to work in modern ecosystem.<p>The interpreter is evolving fast and in near future, I wish to apply modern interpreter building techniques to it.<p>How it works?\n1. PuffinBASIC&#x27;s grammar is defined using antlr4.\n2. At runtime, the user source code is parsed using antlr4 lexer+parser.\n3. After parsing, an intermediate representation (IR) of the source code is generated. A symbol table keeps track of variables, scalars, arrays, etc. objects.\n4. A runtime, processes the IR instructions and executes them.<p>Performance\nPuffinBASIC is an interpreter, and it should not be expected to have very good performance characteristics. Certain operations such as PRINT USING, INPUT, etc. are not optimized for performance. I have not benchmarked PuffinBASIC primitives. That being said, we have written games with graphics in PuffinBASIC is work very well.<p>TESSEL - A 2D Tile Game written in PuffinBASIC\nSource: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mayuropensource&#x2F;PuffinBASIC&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;samples&#x2F;tessel&#x2F;tessel.bas\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mayuropensource&#x2F;PuffinBASIC&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;s...</a>\nLink to YouTube video demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;L8xkM-g3Zms\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;L8xkM-g3Zms</a><p>Memory\nPuffinBASIC runs within a JVM and can use as much memory as available for the JVM process.<p>Compatibility\nPuffinBASIC is mostly compatible with Microsoft&#x27;s GWBASIC.

By this time we already finished the incorporation process at the state and registered agent.<p>When the EIN delay was going beyond expectations, I agreed to do a full refund without taking any cut (after issuing a full refund, we were at a loss because we already paid for registered agent, filings, state fee, even out of pocket logo design). I then sent the following email taking the blame and issuing a full refund.<p><i></i>I&#x27;ve issued a full refund, you should have an email with details. You may keep the fully incorporated company, registered agent service paid for 1 year, and the EIN application set to IRS and the logo we did. I am really sorry you had to go through this experience, and greatly appreciate your patience until now. I truly understand your situation and I&#x27;d be no different. But please be aware that this was not the experience I hoped for, and I hope you forgive me for wasting your time.<i></i><p>Now after the refund, the client asked us for some edits in the logo and also to work again on the EIN followup with IRS and see if we can get it, and we did it on a good faith that client might pay after we get it. After many followups with the IRS, we were able to finally get the EIN and when I asked the client if they’d like to continue the process and pay us, he is saying he’d like the EIN for free because I “promised” to get him everything for free. He is a founder member of a large startup community and being an early-stage company I am afraid if this will affect our reputation if we don&#x27;t do this. What should we do?","time":1598279899,"title":"Ask HN: A large community owner is trying to strong-arm us.

Also as data is changing very frequently, it&#x27;s very hard to keep doing this manually. I searched on google and found that all the solutions are just uptime monitoring and nothing and none of them truly measure performance. So I decided to build one for myself. But it turns out website performance monitoring is not so simple after all and with the pandemic, I had very little motivation let alone travel anywhere. It took me 3 months to do research and plan out the architecture to the last detail.<p>I looked at some of the B2C bootstrappers offering a lifetime deal and getting success. That&#x27;s possible because they don&#x27;t have a huge recurring cost with each customer, but in B2B SaaS, you have a recurring cost with each customer.<p>But I thought let me add and see how it goes. So added a lifetime deal with for $199. At that time I posted it on Hacker News [2] and it made it to the front page and all the lifetime deals were over in 12 hours. Then I added $299 which got over during the week. So far I made over $10000 and got more than 35 customers.<p>Even though it might not be profitable in the long run, I got the cashflow and customers in less time and it removed the pressure to chase customers. Now I can focus on the product.<p>One of the biggest challenges of a SaaS startup is to acquire the first 50 customers. I have seen many startups achieve this over 6 to 12 months, some even a few years. But with this initial business model, I have cashflow for a year which is the best thing that can happen to a B2B SaaS. Lifetime deals can be a powerful way to get initial customers especially when you are getting started.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simpleops.io&#x2F;<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23880071","time":1598278842,"title":"Show HN: I made $10000 by posting on Hacker News about my microstartup","type":"story"},{"by":"worldvoyageur","descendants":35,"id":24260861,"kids":[24262026,24261928,24261490,24261420],"score":26,"time":1598278563,"title":"Free Expression of Professors and Its Prudential Limits","type":"story","url":"https://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2020/08/free-expression-of-professors-and-its.html"},{"by":"dsr12","descendants":17,"id":24260810,"kids":[24261653,24261030,24261074,24261433,24261388],"score":17,"time":1598278258,"title":"World’s first COVID19 reinfected patient","type":"story","url":"https://twitter.com/cwylilian/status/1297830744509698050"},{"by":"claudeganon","descendants":3,"id":24260779,"kids":[24261552,24260818],"score":1,"time":1598278105,"title":"First Covid-19 reinfection documented in Hong Kong, researchers say","type":"story","url":"https://www.statnews.com/2020/08/24/first-covid-19-reinfection-documented-in-hong-kong-researchers-say/"},{"by":"scaramanga","descendants":5,"id":24260736,"kids":[24262296,24261025,24267420],"score":67,"time":1598277800,"title":"Minotaur: A pythonic, asynchronous, inotify interface","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/giannitedesco/minotaur"},{"by":"dsiegel2275","descendants":2,"id":24260705,"kids":[24260762,24261038],"score":5,"text":"I&#x27;m curious to hear from both folks that have been in the industry for decades and those that are still relatively new:  To the best of your knowledge what is the oldest bit of code that you&#x27;ve written that you know (or believe) is still running in production?<p>For myself: I wrote a data management system for nuclear reactor steam generator inspection&#x2F;repair  in VB6 from 1997-1999.

I found myself struggling a lot with this as I found every solution I tried hard to implement (Firebase, Mongo Atlas, EC2). I mean I only needed a simple endpoint in which I was able to set and get JSON data with some key. In the end I made a small CRUD using Mongo, Sinatra, Puma, and Nginx. Then Chrome complained that my endpoint (raw IP) was not HTTPS so I bought a cheap domain and configured an SSL certificate into my server. I found this to be a repetitive yet time consuming process and I decided to solve this problem by myself.<p>With that said I created Pandora, a platform that allows you to create key-value stores in a very quick way. More specifically with Pandora you can:<p>- [Create | Delete] services (key-value storage). Each service is logically isolated from each other. You can interact with a service by its own URL (db-&lt;service_id&gt;.not-a-db.com).<p>- Associate some custom URL to a service. Let&#x27;s say you own example.com, then you can use that to interact with some service. SSL certificate is generated and renewed automatically on the background.<p>- [Create | Retrieve | Update | Delete] a JSON value associated to some key (unique per service).<p>You can find the complete API reference here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notion.so&#x2F;Pandora-Server-API-875a7902c00d4f29969c24d7770c95ec<p>Also, I created a guess user in which you can try Pandora:<p>- Email: guess@not-a-db.com\n - Password: helloguess123<p>There&#x27;s also this CLI for admin operations (not interacting with a service) that you can try too: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pandorakv&#x2F;pandoractl<p>As you can see this is still in a very early stage and I&#x27;d be more than happy to know what feedback do you have.

I&#x27;m a CS major for context. After my freshman or sophomore year, I realized that I&#x27;m pretty solid with reading, memorizing and spitting back out info, but taking info&#x2F;frameworks and applying it to new problems&#x2F;contexts is where I fail. I feel like my brain is hopelessly linear&#x2F;rudimentary when I try to solve problems, if that makes any sense. Since realizing that, I have not fixed this gap, I&#x27;ve just been barely getting through school. I seem to have a...hill that I need to climb before I get into a focused, deliberate state of learning and applying hard things. When I do manage to complete complex work...it&#x27;s poorly done&#x2F;organized&#x2F;thought through. This is likely a result of a combination of poorly selected shortcuts in learning&#x2F;getting through classes and doing the bare minimum at certain points. I valued getting through school over thoroughly understanding what I&#x27;m doing and maybe having to retake some more classes. I&#x27;m at a point where this weakness has shown&#x2F;will probably show in high level classes and potentially in whatever job I start in January. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll ever be someone who &quot;loves to solve problems&quot; or &quot;loves getting into the details&quot;, but I&#x27;d like to be able to get to that kind of mindset when necessary.<p>Now, I think can have a bad to mediocre career at this point, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll achieve the goals I have unless I handle this issue. So ya - how do I learn how to learn hard things? Or how do I learn to turn my desire to learn&#x2F;apply certain topics&#x2F;do certain projects into meaningful action? If anyone has gone from a similar point to actually becoming thoroughly competent - I would love to hear how you turned the ship around.","time":1598211692,"title":"Ask HN: How do I learn how to learn hard things?","type":"story"},{"by":"infodocket","descendants":9,"id":24254712,"kids":[24255169,24255152,24256663,24255704],"score":33,"time":1598212067,"title":"Loot boxes in online games and their effect on consumers [pdf]","type":"story","url":"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2020/652732/IPOL_ATA(2020)652732_EN.pdf"},{"by":"jseliger","descendants":7,"id":24254607,"kids":[24254986,24254740,24254802,24254793,24255526,24270844],"score":18,"time":1598211149,"title":"The Open-Office Trap (2014)","type":"story","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-open-office-trap"},{"by":"pupdogg","descendants":11,"id":24254606,"kids":[24254933,24254962,24254672,24254799],"score":11,"time":1598211137,"title":"Joe Biden's mysteriously disappearing “Dislikes” on YouTube","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LvnNUZjRO0"},{"by":"nutanc","descendants":3,"id":24254446,"kids":[24254725,24257842],"score":5,"time":1598209813,"title":"Ask HN: Why are many new Launch HNs written like recipe pages written for SEO","type":"story"},{"by":"rbhatia46","descendants":12,"id":24254311,"kids":[24254724,24254899,24254987,24254855,24288972,24256156,24254964],"score":43,"time":1598208845,"title":"Ways to fetch financial data for algo trading","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/rbhatia46/Fetching-Financial-Data"},{"by":"brainless","descendants":2,"id":24254273,"kids":[24254390,24254306],"score":9,"time":1598208628,"title":"Apple Offered to Halve App Store Fee to Get Amazon Prime Video on iOS","type":"story","url":"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/30/apple-halved-app-store-fee-amazon-prime-video/"},{"by":"stollercyrus","descendants":3,"id":24254269,"kids":[24255350,24259309,24262106],"score":8,"text":"Hi HN,<p>With the growing number of wildfires in California, I&#x27;ve been thinking about the best ways to digitize old family photos and slides.

We are Oliver and Anton, and are founders at Depict.ai. We help online stores challenge Amazon by building recommender systems that don&#x27;t require any sales or behavioral data at all.<p>Today, most recommender systems are based on a class of methods commonly called ‘collaborative filtering’ - which means that they generate recommendations based on a user&#x27;s past behavior. This method is successfully used by Amazon and Netflix (see the <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Netflix_Prize\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Netflix_Prize</a>). They are also very unsuccessfully used by smaller companies that lack the critical mass of historical behavioral data required to use those models effectively. This generally results in the cold start problem (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cold_start_(recommender_systems)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cold_start_(recommender_system...</a>) and a worse customer experience. We solve this by not focusing on understanding the customer but instead focus on understanding the product.<p>The way we do this is with machine learning techniques that create vector representations of products based on the products’ images and descriptions, and recommend matching using these vector representations. More specifically, we have found a way to scrape the web and then train massive neural networks on e-commerce products. This makes it possible to leverage large amounts of product metadata to make truly impressive recommendations for any e-commerce store.<p>One analogy we like is that just as almost no single company has enough sales or behavioral data to consistently predict, for instance, credit card frauds on their own, almost no e-commerce company has enough data to generate good recommendations based only on their own information. Stripe can make excellent fraud detection models by pooling transactions from many smaller companies, and we can do the same thing for personalizing e-commerce stores by pooling product metadata.<p>Through A&#x2F;B-tests we have proved that we can increase top-line revenue with 4-6% for almost any e-commerce store. To prove our value we offer the tests and setup 100% for free. We make money by taking a cut of the revenue uplift we generate in the A&#x2F;B-tests. We have also found that the sales and decision cycle gets much shorter by being independent of customer&#x27;s user data. You can see us live at Staples Nordics and kitchentime.com, among others.<p>Oliver and I have several years of experience applying recommender systems within e-commerce and education respectively and felt uneasy about a winner-takes-it-all development where the largest companies could use their data supremacy to out-personalize any smaller company. Our goal is to build a company that can offer the best personalization to any e-commerce store, not just the ones with enough data.<p>Do you think our approach seems interesting, crazy, lazy or somewhere in the middle?

Many car manufacturers where showing off self driving prototypes in well controlled environments. High-Tech giants were spending a lot of money in the technology. We thought it was going to be a revolution in our societies.<p>From a technical point of view we thought that we need to accumulate a lot of data and thanks to the magic machine learning, it will work out. We used lidars, cameras, or both.<p>Today the enthusiasm is gone, rumours say Apple canceled the project, Google hasn&#x27;t released anything, Uber killed a pedestrian, PSA announced that the technology wasn&#x27;t there, Renault forgot about it while his CEO was busy escaping countries, etc...<p>Then you have Tesla, with a insanely high stock price, that pretend to be close to full self driving thanks to machine learning. I rented a Tesla model 3 for the first time this weekend and it&#x27;s insane. The Tesla AI is stupid and dangerous. The AI has issues with simple tasks such as managing the windshield wipers, but will also do dangerous thinks such as smashing the brakes once in a while.<p>I started to reflect about the limitations of machine learning because of one &quot;phantom breaking&quot; incident I experienced. I was driving on a motorway and I was catching up a car pulling a boat on a trailer and we entered a tunnel. I guess the AI wasn&#x27;t trained for that situation, seeing a boat in a tunnel in a Norwegian motorway, because it decided to do an emergency stop. A vision based but non machine learning approach would have detected the moving object in front of me, estimated the distance and assumed I was safe.<p>So, do you think we simply need more data for training and machine learning will stop doing stupid things? We need to accumule data for all kind of objects people can put on a trailer in all light conditions?

It would also be the main differentiator.<p>FYI I made a proposal for Mozilla (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;pulse&#x2F;open-letter-mozilla-please-offer-g-suite-alternative-marius-andreiana&#x2F;) which seemed a great fit, but they weren&#x27;t interested.","time":1598136056,"title":"Ask HN: How would you tackle building a successful G Suite alternative?","type":"story"},{"by":"troydavis","descendants":27,"id":24247688,"kids":[24247709,24250638,24250347,24248476,24252871,24249313,24249887],"score":79,"time":1598134347,"title":"Searx instances","type":"story","url":"https://searx.space/"},{"by":"walterbell","descendants":2,"id":24247667,"kids":[24248842,24249394],"score":21,"time":1598134111,"title":"2000 Year Old Analog Computer - Decoding the Antikythera Mechanism","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSQNEPbQOiI&feature=youtu.be"},{"by":"Parseus","descendants":11,"id":24247586,"kids":[24248758,24250562,24256847],"score":70,"time":1598133366,"title":"RPCS3 Inside Look: A Deep-Dive into Hardware and Performance Scaling","type":"story","url":"https://rpcs3.net/blog/2020/08/21/hardware-performance-scaling/"},{"by":"totaldude87","descendants":9,"id":24247532,"kids":[24248285,24250246,24247614,24247714,24247713,24247642,24247547,24247769],"score":5,"time":1598132893,"title":"Ask HN: Which is the easiest programming language to start with","type":"story"},{"by":"vanilla-almond","descendants":399,"id":24247561,"kids":[24248037,24249223,24248199,24248515,24250438,24248194,24247921,24248025,24248186,24249883,24250269,24248819,24249969,24249330,24250634,24250594,24250490,24247811,24248049,24247866,24247896,24247814,24248039,24249135,24247952,24259754,24247935,24253525,24258627,24252688,24250909,24250412,24250174,24250395,24250752,24248543,24249422,24250608,24251396,24248189,24258965,24250335,24247861,24252406,24250755,24247863,24251519,24250439,24249188,24248565,24250079,24251204,24247964,24251146,24249112,24251129,24247824,24250964,24254287,24254662,24250356,24250844,24249565,24261330,24249956,24257597,24248590,24250693,24251324,24250025,24250694,24248178,24247895,24257042,24252690,24257039,24248176,24248083,24247891,24250275,24247804,24249869,24248903,24250570,24250716,24261308,24247941,24249909,24250674],"score":712,"time":1598133168,"title":"The cost of 1GB of mobile data in 228 countries (Feb 2020)","type":"story","url":"https://www.cable.co.uk/mobiles/worldwide-data-pricing/"},{"by":"ccajas","descendants":2,"id":24247434,"kids":[24247700,24247782],"score":5,"text":"In the decade of 2000&#x27;s we saw a plethora of graphical interfaces being used for web site and server management.

Similar with MAMP on Mac platforms. Uploading files could be done with a myriad of FTP software with drag-and-drop interfaces.<p>Then the transition to more CLI based tools took on strongly in the 2010&#x27;s and its momentum does not appear to let up. The benefits of CLI completely are discovered in that you have more control, everything is more &quot;exposed&quot; and with more flexibility.

My current landlord and realtor of course know my name and that I’m leaving. My next landlord and realtor know this too, since my address is on the new lease. So one of them could have told Comcast. Or I suppose Comcast could deduce their customers’ behavior by scraping rental sites.

In the last three placed I’ve rented, I’ve been able to plug my Comcast router straight in and connect to the internet immediately, without contacting them first.  The first time this happened I was perplexed, and when I called to notify them of my change in address, the rep said that the renters before me must’ve forgot to cancel <i>their</i> account with them. This didn’t seem like the truth, so I tried it again when we moved for a second time, and then again when we moved a third time. The last move was to a different state. Each time, the router connected immediately, and each time the Comcast rep told me that this was because the previous tenants had forgotten to cancel or update their account.","time":1598112365,"title":"Ask HN: Why and how did Comcast figure out I'm moving?","type":"story"},{"by":"sjreese","descendants":2,"id":24244823,"kids":[24248355,24245019],"score":2,"time":1598110790,"title":"The Secret Sims Used by Criminals to Spoof Any Number","type":"story","url":"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/n7w9pw/russian-sims-encrypted"},{"by":"spookylettuce","descendants":8,"id":24244817,"kids":[24247440,24252195,24250893,24245138,24245583,24252461],"score":6,"text":"I work as a remote developer &#x2F; data architect.

Plum Mail (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plummail.co\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plummail.co</a>) is a messaging app that gives you better conversation features than email and instant messengers. These features help make conversations more useful and easier to get value from.<p>Today we&#x27;re launching Plum Mail in early access. You can join our Wait List to be one of the early users by emailing yesplease@plummail.co.<p>Email is disorganised, instant messaging is distracting and group chats are hard to keep track of. But email is great, because everyone has an email address. Why can’t we build an awesome messaging platform that lets us keep our email addresses? Our insight: keep the email\naddress but replace the emails with something better.<p>The first thing we want to fix is group conversations. Conversations between three or more people in email get messy quickly. We can solve that with the ability to break off-topic messages out into sub-threads or the ability to conclude a thread. We’re working on the ability to highlight text and pin it to a noticeboard so important pieces of information don’t get lost in high message volume.<p>To help solve the issue of distraction created by platforms such as Slack, we’re introducing features like inbox delay, group chat message rate limits, and a complete lack of notification noises. Our design philosophy is respect and simplicity. We do not want to nudge you to check your inbox with things like red dots or read receipts.<p>We are also offering greater control over adding and removing people from conversation threads. Here’s a demo video showing some of this in action: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Yf-82ychDgA&amp;t=6s\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Yf-82ychDgA&amp;t=6s</a><p>Peter and I started Plum Mail because we had these problems with email and IM ourselves. Group chats quickly get out of hand. We find it really hard to organise our annual ski trips with friends in Whatsapp. Half our mates just want to share <i>hilarious</i>\nGIFs that smother the conversation we’re trying to have about dates or hotels or ski hire. I love a funny GIF as much as the next guy so we probably just need to think about where the funny GIFs live and where the details about our hotel reservations live. i.e, not on top of each other.<p>We also have 12 months&#x27; experience working exclusively on passwordless authentication technologies in our company DID.app. We realised that the marriage of passwordless authentication with a common messaging platform could be a happy one.<p>Our vision for Plum Mail is to position it alongside other premium inbox products on the market to people that care about new features enabling them to have great quality conversations online. However, Plum Mail will remain open and accessible to all at some level so that users can enjoy the freedom of writing to anyone (whether they’re a user or not) whilst enjoying the clear benefits of messaging inside a common system instead of over email protocol.<p>We would love to hear your thoughts. In particular, what do you dislike about either email or instant messaging? Anything goes! This feels to us like an opportunity to re-imagine how communication online can work.","time":1598036448,"title":"Launch HN: Plum Mail (YC S20) – Email alternative for group conversations","type":"story"},{"by":"teddyh","descendants":2,"id":24237845,"kids":[24238364,24238916],"score":14,"time":1598036577,"title":"101 GDPR Complaints on EU-US data transfers filed","type":"story","url":"https://noyb.eu/en/101-complaints-eu-us-transfers-filed"},{"by":"imran3740","descendants":15,"id":24237576,"kids":[24237977,24238054,24237774,24237921,24237890,24238323,24240459,24237799],"score":57,"time":1598034792,"title":"Thompson, Ritchie and Kernighan admit that Unix was a prank (1989)","type":"story","url":"http://www.stokely.com/lighter.side/unix.prank.html"},{"by":"viburnum","descendants":7,"id":24237545,"kids":[24238517,24238263],"score":10,"time":1598034581,"title":"The Lesson Americans Never Learn","type":"story","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/08/gofundme-economy-was-never-going-work/615457/"},{"by":"weinzierl","descendants":205,"id":24237512,"kids":[24237969,24237729,24237690,24239829,24237794,24242023,24238842,24239370,24240069,24237724,24238309,24242970,24238463,24238858,24239072,24241128,24241412,24241373,24239736,24238135,24237767,24241130,24237837,24239664,24239106,24238631,24239558,24239041,24237738,24240761,24238321,24241866,24238663,24239676,24238011],"score":361,"time":1598034381,"title":"An Update on MDN Web Docs","type":"story","url":"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/08/an-update-on-mdn-web-docs/"},{"by":"arkadiyt","descendants":8,"id":24237400,"kids":[24238066,24239189,24238850],"score":37,"time":1598033615,"title":"Spotify hit with outage after forgetting to renew a certificate","type":"story","url":"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/spotify-hit-with-outage-after-forgetting-to-renew-a-certifficate/"},{"by":"aleyan","descendants":4,"id":24237374,"kids":[24248805,24248750,24253095,24252698],"score":22,"time":1598033446,"title":"Pod Cars of the Past and Future: The Morgantown PRT (2016) [video]","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaSaWfw07Sw"},{"by":"notRobot","descendants":5,"id":24237360,"kids":[24238963,24237832,24248420],"score":26,"time":1598033355,"title":"Microsoft removes the ability to disable Defender via the registery","type":"story","url":"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/customize/desktop/unattend/security-malware-windows-defender-disableantispyware"},{"by":"cosmicskewl","descendants":2,"id":24237346,"kids":[24237347,24242276],"score":1,"time":1598033244,"title":"Show HN: Critical Role Dungeons and Dragons dialogue sumamrization dataset","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/RevanthRameshkumar/CRD3"},{"by":"amardeep","descendants":81,"id":24237207,"kids":[24237406,24237682,24238829,24237857,24239208,24237621,24237639,24239288,24238973,24241837,24239781,24240607,24241367,24242153,24241375,24237541,24240995,24237691,24251503,24239103,24243939,24240302,24247380,24240060,24239102,24241896,24244562,24237960],"score":799,"time":1598032296,"title":"Fast.ai releases new deep learning course, libraries, and book","type":"story","url":"https://www.fast.ai/2020/08/21/fastai2-launch/"},{"by":"duke_core","descendants":4,"id":24237200,"kids":[24306272,24237277,24237511],"score":2,"text":"Currently experiencing it with Django.

everyone! We are Dragos and Thiago from GitDuck (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitduck.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitduck.com</a>). We are building GitDuck, a Zoom for developers with direct integration to the IDE so software developers can talk and collaborate in real-time.<p>It all started by accident, Dragos and I were working on something else, a screen recording tool and we started to use it internally to record short videos of our code. At first it was just for quick code reviews and to debug, but soon we realized how helpful it was to have a video explanation of the code. Kind of rubber duck debugging with video. ;)<p>After talking to almost 300 developers and learning that other people were facing similar collaboration issues we decided to focus 100% on building this tool. We are the first users and we use GitDuck internally for quick assistance, pair programming, code reviews or just discussing ideas.<p>It has the features you would expect in a video call tool — like audio, video chat and screen sharing, but the UX and the integrations were built exclusively for developers. You can easily share your code and do pair programming. We are  building integrations for all the IDEs. This enables you to collaborate without screen sharing (so it&#x27;s faster and and consumes less bandwidth), directly from your IDE and independently of the IDE that other people are using.<p>Whenever you join a GitDuck meeting, your IDE extension wakes up and allows you to share your code with the other meeting participants (or join the already shared code from other meeting participant). When your peers join your code, they can see and edit your files in real-time, similar to the Google Docs experience. At any given point you can also go to your peers position so you can see in which file and line they are.<p>Check a 1 min demo \n(<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitduck.com&#x2F;watch&#x2F;5f1808919552aefe64ce0751\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitduck.com&#x2F;watch&#x2F;5f1808919552aefe64ce0751</a>)<p>GitDuck currently has integrations to VS Code and VSCodium. In the next few days we are going to release the integrations to all JetBrains IDEs. Vim, Sublime and others coming after that.<p>One important aspect to mention is security. We are the first users of the service so we focus a lot on building something that we would trust to use ourselves. All the files shared from your IDE are always shared via peer-to-peer and are end-to-end encrypted. No piece of code never touches our servers, so we never have access to your code.<p>All calls are encrypted and p2p (if 4 or less participants). If 5 or more people join we switch to a cloud infrastructure in order to maintain the quality, but the media are always encrypted and we never have access to your calls.

We’re Oliver and Hamzah from Hubble (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gethubble.io&#x2F;hn\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gethubble.io&#x2F;hn</a>). Hubble runs tests on your data warehouse so you can identify issues with data quality. You can test for things like missing values, uniqueness of data or how frequently data is added&#x2F;updated.<p>We worked together for the last 4 years at a startup where we built and managed data products for insurers and banks. A common pattern we saw was teams taking data from their internal tools (CRM, HR system, etc.), application databases, and 3rd party data and storing it in a warehouse for analysis. However, when analysts&#x2F;data scientists used the data for reports they would spot something suspicious and the engineering team would have to manually go through the data pipelines to find the source of the problem. More often than not it was simple things like a spike in missing values because an ETL job failed or stale data because a 3rd party data source hadn’t updated correctly. We realised that reliability&#x2F; trustworthiness of the raw data was essential before you could start abstracting away more interesting tasks like analysis, insight or predictions.<p>We wanted to do this without having to write and maintain lots of individual tests in our code. So we built Hubble, which connects to a data warehouse and creates tests based on the type of data being stored (i.e. freshness of timestamps, the cardinality of strings, max value of numbers, missing values, etc.). We’ve also added the ability to write any custom tests using a built-in SQL editor. All the tests run on a schedule and you’ll get an email or slack alert when they fail. We’re also building webhooks and an Airflow operator so you can run tests immediately after running an ETL job or trigger a process to fix a failing test.<p>Instead of asking users to send their data to us, the tests are run in the data warehouse and we track the test results over time. Today we support BigQuery, Snowflake and Rockset (which lets us work with MongoDB and DynamoDB) and are adding more on request.<p>We’re planning on charging $200 a month for a few seats, and $30-50 for extra users after that.<p>We’re still at an early access stage but want the HN community’s feedback so we’ve opened up access to the app for a few days, you can try it out here <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gethubble.io&#x2F;hn\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gethubble.io&#x2F;hn</a>.

On a few occasions I tried to make proposals but they were heavily criticized.<p>At this point I feel extremely isolated from the team, and like all I can do is stay out of the way and do what people ask. I&#x27;m constantly worried about being told I&#x27;m not good enough technically. I&#x27;ve basically given up on trying to have an opinion because it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter.<p>Does anyone have advice?

I’m Uday, and I co-founded Epihub [0] with Kwasi and Michael (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;epihub.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;epihub.com</a>). Epihub is Shopify for teaching online. Our software lets you schedule, meet, and bill clients from your own website.<p>A few years ago, we started building a product called Epigrammar, which was a collaborative document annotation tool that let teachers rapidly give feedback to their students by identifying trends in their feedback. Kwasi and I really wanted to see if we could scale the tutoring experience to an entire classroom, since my co-founder Mike was teaching Classics at a private school in Connecticut while running a non-profit tutoring program in Latin&#x2F;Greek for public school students in New York. Mike would try out our products that we had built over the weekend during the week (sometimes to success), but oftentimes, things were not actually helping him teach. That’s when we&#x27;d go back to the drawing board. We spent a few years experimenting with different ideas in edtech trying to scale tutoring, as we obsessed over Bloom’s 2 sigma problem [1] including Superhuman for grading and even a test generator that could build assessments based on “backward-design [2]. We all lived together in Manhattan, built stuff, and would send it out to Mike to see what worked and what didn&#x27;t.<p>This spring, however, as COVID-19 shut down local businesses across the city (we still live in New York), we realized that there were much bigger problems facing tutoring, coaching, and training businesses like Mike&#x27;s: bringing the actual business online.<p>Whether you want to start up a coding bootcamp or run a tutoring business, you need a handful of products that are (ideally) white-labeled: a website builder, a way to process application forms, a CRM, a system to book appointments, a ticketing system for virtual classes, virtual classrooms, invoicing, and paystub tracking. When we spoke with tutors, coaches, and trainers, it was clear that there was a similar problem facing many different but similar businesses. How do you handle appointments? How do you handle virtual classes? How do you manage your team’s schedules?<p>We spent our summer trying to build everything end-to-end, and finally, we’re excited to share that product with you today. Epihub lets you build a website (or embeds into your existing website) and also comes with a full system to schedule, meet, and bill clients in one place (you can change all the buttons, images, and language within your account to reflect your business so you can rename your employees to instructors or your currency to Solari).<p>Similarly, you’re working online with individuals or groups, you can start teaching anyone on username.epihub.com and easily grow your entire team by adding additional seats for new instructors to manage their schedules and paystubs. So far, we’ve been working with tutors, coaches, trainers, but we have seen a bunch of interesting use-cases as well (including someone who wants to set up Epihub for virtual wine tasting and tours).<p>The stack actually borrows a lot from our original product: it’s an Elixir&#x2F;Phoenix application with a React frontend. We have a Zoom and Google Calendar integration, so you’ll also see appointments and requests in your calendar, as each hub comes with yoursubdomain.epihub.com&#x2F;reserve to handle bookings from prospective clients. It&#x27;s like a Calendly built to scale your team’s operations by syncing up invoicing, paystubs, and virtual classrooms. (Recently, we’ve been contemplating Liquid templating, and we’re considering building a Wordpress plugin. If anyone has worked with Liquid, Kwasi and I would love to chat.)<p>If there’s anyone running a coaching, tutoring, or training business, or coding bootcamp, we&#x27;d love to hear how we could support your team. You can also book a personal onboarding with Mike over Zoom (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vip.epihub.com&#x2F;reserve\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vip.epihub.com&#x2F;reserve</a>).<p>Finally, I’ve been a member of HN for as long as I can remember. I’ve had my share of unfinished projects, and things I’ve been a bit nervous to launch here. I didn’t think I ever would launch anything, so this is pretty exciting.

Players fight enemies with a low-cost wearable which uses smart resistance bands to simulate real combat training. Our aim is to be Peloton meets gaming meets boxing, at 1&#x2F;10th of the price. We launched on Kickstarter yesterday, and would love it if you checked us out! Here’s the link: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kickstarter.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;quelltech&#x2F;quell-real-gaming-real-exercise-zero-compromise\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kickstarter.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;quelltech&#x2F;quell-real-ga...</a><p>We started building Quell because for us, exercise wasn’t fun; it was work. We’d tried all the stats tracking apps and the cycling simulators, but they weren’t treating that root problem. Over time, as the novelty wore off, we were left with the feeling that working out was still boring and uncomfortable.<p>As big gamers, gamification seemed like an obvious solution. We looked at what was happening in this space and felt that exercise games tended to compromise on the exercise or the game. We believed that, if we could get both right, we could make something we’d want to play. Everything in the market was focussed on running, cycling or yoga&#x2F;pilates, so we went with boxing as a more intense and cathartic alternative.<p>We realised that Quell could be a real business when we started talking to people about exercise. Everyone was facing the same two problems: obstacles, and a lack of reward. The absence of immediate rewards when you exercise means that you have to propel yourself using long-term benefits, and most of us are bad at this. On top of that, seemingly small barriers like weather, travel, set-up, knowledge and equipment sharing have a massive impact on people&#x27;s ability to commit.<p>The team started working together in February, but we all had other things going on. Cam had just left his career in management consulting to do a design master’s. Martin was wrapping up his PhD in sensor tech at Oxford. Doug was building a business providing remote working and development retreats. Lorenzo was doing a design master’s to pursue a career in prosthetic design. None of us had the financial stability to make this our full-time job, so we decided to develop the product over a year or two in our spare time. After a month, we applied to YC with zero expectation of being accepted. Our idea was basically a punching bag with a screen, and we knew it wasn’t where we wanted it to be. We saw the YC application as a forcing mechanism to put some rigour behind the business, and an exciting experience to go through.<p>Then Covid hit, and the target market went from ‘people who don’t like exercise’ to ‘people who don’t like home exercise or running around the same park every day’. We went into overdrive, using all of our days off and lunch breaks to develop the product. Despite all this effort, the pace was glacial. All the workshops closed during lockdown, so we had no tools. We were separated in different parts of the UK, trying to build hardware via Zoom. Then YC accepted us, and we could finally focus! We left our jobs and degrees. Everyone moved into Cam&#x27;s apartment. We bought a 3D printer, a sewing machine and a bunch of electronics and textiles. We spent all day every day looping through talking to users, collating insights, designing and prototyping.<p>We learned that no one wanted the hassle of a punchbag, but everyone loved the idea of feeling the satisfying physical resistance of punching something at home. We built a wearable which applied customisable resistance to punches through swappable elastic bands, and it landed well. We started looking at computer vision to translate player punches into the game, but our potential users hated the idea of setting up a camera. After hundreds of hours spent punching the air in our living room, we found that we could get high-accuracy, low-latency gesture recognition through a neural net applied to inertial measurement units in the gloves.<p>We made a quick video and website with our first prototype (link here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1hrIegPSxko2JPzsztm_1UmV4iROdQKki&#x2F;view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1hrIegPSxko2JPzsztm_1UmV4iRO...</a>), then started advertising on Facebook and Instagram to see how it landed. The response was incredible, with CPA coming in 75% lower than our benchmarks. We opened pre-orders to test whether these people would convert and got fifty orders in the first month. After drafting our bill of materials, we settled on a price of $200 for the wearable and $10&#x2F;mo in subscription fees, which works out at less than half the average gym membership. With 55m active gamers paying for a gym membership pre-covid, we estimate a market size of $18bn.<p>With the financials sorted and the early market validation complete, we felt confident in building towards a Kickstarter. For the last month, we’ve been working hard on turning ideas into concept art into game content, making the product look and feel good, shooting the video, writing the copy, pricing, costing, and growing our sign-up list. We launched our Kickstarter yesterday, and have recieved over $60k in pledges in our first 24 hours.

Some facts about me:<p>* My background is in Security (i.e. pentesting&#x2F;red teaming, security engineering) and I spent some time as a &quot;DevOps&quot; guy. I&#x27;m comfortable with designing and building cloud environments, worked a lot on Kubernetes, poked around Kafka. I&#x27;ve reviewed security for event driven architectures etc. So I&#x27;ve seen a few things around the block and I know how things fit together in modern environments. I&#x27;m Senior in my security role.<p>* I can &quot;code&quot; but I&#x27;m no &quot;software engineer&quot;. I can throw together whatever several hundred lines of Python I need to get anything done, I&#x27;ve built quite a few frontend and backend services for side projects over the years, worked with MQs etc. but I&#x27;m no software architect. If I wanted to get hired as a software engineer I&#x27;d probably be looking at junior-mid-level positions, but I feel I would ramp up quite fast given transferable skills I have from Security and &quot;DevOps&quot;. Probably what I&#x27;m lacking most is theoretical CS stuff that would come up in interviews.<p>* I&#x27;m doing the MITx &quot;Statistics and Data Science MicorMasters&quot; part-time.<p>* I have enough savings to quit my job and spend a solid year (or even two) re-skilling without emptying the bank account.<p>* I&#x27;m not under the illusion that I can transfer to ML after a puny MicroMasters and start doing some hardcore theoretical stuff.

We started as a technical tool to monitor client accounts in Slack, interfacing with Microsoft Azure insights, and then pivoted to supporting business intelligence tools like Google Analytics and Google Search Console.<p>The idea was born out of the angst that we had experienced using disparate tools to monitor our metrics, client &amp; to share information. Google Analytics has an ever-evolving interface that most developers would rather not spend a day getting lost in. We decided to take the primary use cases we had for Google Analytics and provide an engine to process, visualize, and ship to Slack or Teams. This gets us daily or weekly reports on metrics such as page speed, bounce rates, page engagement, and when the cart checkout breaks.<p>Once we started to gain some traction with clients, we extended the capacity to include other data sources like Google Search Console and Google Ads, making it simple for indie businesses and large corporations to extract the value from these reporting surfaces and send them to a channel that we use every day, like Slack or Teams. We use ML to analyze 100s of metric streams to detect anomalies in your data, and are soon expanding into providing root-cause analysis when anomalies occur.<p>Currently, we send 2.6k alerts per week and 3.2K scheduled reports into Slack, Teams &amp; Email. Slack has seen the biggest uptake followed by Teams. We run on Azure, combines NoSQL, Serverless, Redis, Warehousing, and scalable architecture to deal with bursty loads (common in report scheduling).<p>We&#x27;re launching new data sources and integrations rapidly, with Facebook, Stripe, and Zapier next on our docket.<p>Happy to answer any questions you might have.","time":1597764336,"title":"Show HN: GA Insights – Never Log into Google

Strangely, instead of spending time developing models or building the trading system, a large portion of our time was spent on just sourcing and on-boarding datasets to train and feed our models. The process of testing datasets and on-boarding them was archaic; one data provider served us XML files over FTP which we then had to spend weeks transforming for our models to ingest. A different provider asked us to spin up our own database and then sent us a binary which was used to load the data. We had to whitelist their API ip-address and setup a cronjob to make sure the dataset was never out of date. The binary provided an interactive input so it couldn&#x27;t be scripted, or rather it could be but you need something to mock the interactive params. All this took a junior developer on the team a good 3-4 days to figure out and setup. Furthermore after our trial expired we decided we didn&#x27;t actually need this dataset so those 3-4 days were essentially wasted. Our frustration around the status-quo in data distribution is what drove us to start our company.<p>We spent the first 6 months building a privacy-aware query engine (think Presto but with built in privacy primitives), but software developers we talked to would frequently divert the topic to the lack of high quality, sanitised testing data during the software development lifecycle. It was strange - most of us developers and data scientists constantly use some sort of testing data for different reasons. Maybe you want a local development environment which is representative of production but clean from customer data. Or a staging environment which contains a much smaller, representative database so that tests run faster. You could want the dataset to be much bigger to test how your application scales. Maybe you want to share your database with 3rd party contractors who you don&#x27;t necessarily trust. Whichever way you put it, it&#x27;s strange that for a problem most of us face every day, we have no idiomatic solution. We write bespoke scripts and pipelines which often break. They are time consuming to write and maintain and every time your schema changes you need to update them manually. Or we get lazy and copy&#x2F;paste production.<p>We finally listened to all this feedback, dropped the previous product, and built Synth instead. Synth is a platform for provisioning databases with completely synthetic data.<p>The way Synth works can be broken into 3 main steps. You first download our CLI tool (a bunch of python wrapped up in a container) and point it at your database to create a model (we host the models on the Synth platform). This model encodes your schema, and foreign key relationships as well as a semantic representation of your types. We currently use simple regular expressions to classify the semantic types (for example an address or license plate). The whole model is represented as a JSON object - if the classifier gets something wrong you can easily change the semantic type. Once the model has been created, the next step is to train the model. Under the hood we use a combination of copulas and deep-learning models to model the distributions and correlations in your dataset (the intuition here is that it&#x27;s much more useful for developers to have realistic data than just sample from a random number generator). The final step is to use the trained model to generate synthetic data. You can either sample directly from the model or we can spin up a database for you and fill it with as much data as you need. The generation step samples from the trained model to create realistic data, as well as utilising bespoke generators for sensitive fields (credit card numbers, names, addresses etc.)<p>You can run the entire lifecycle in a single command - you point the CLI tool at your database (currently Postgres, MySQL and MsSQL) and in ~1 minute you get an i.p. address and credentials to your new database with completely synthetic data.<p>We&#x27;re long time fans of HN and are eagerly looking forward to feedback from the community (especially criticism). We&#x27;ve made a free version available for this week so you can try it with no strings attached. We hope some of you will find Synth useful. If you have any questions we&#x27;ll be around throughout the day. Also feel free to get in touch via the site.<p>Thanks!\n~ Christos, Damien &amp; Nodar","time":1597756143,"title":"Launch HN: Synth (YC S20) – Realistic, synthetic test data for your app","type":"story"},{"by":"rishikeerthi","descendants":2,"id":24198054,"kids":[24198493,24198092],"score":3,"text":"In python based web apps be it django or flask or any other frameworks.

You can think of us as version control for data passing through your messaging systems. With Batch, a company is able to go back in time, see what data looked like at a certain point and if it makes sense, replay that piece of data back into the company&#x27;s systems.<p>This idea was born out of getting annoyed by what an unwieldy blackbox Kafka is. While many folks use Kafka for streaming, there is an equal number of Kafka users that use it as a traditional messaging system. Historically, these systems have offered very poor visibility into what&#x27;s going on inside them and offer (at best) a poor replay experience. This problem is prevalent pretty much across every messaging system. Especially if the messages on the bus are serialized, it is almost guaranteed that you will have to write custom, one-off scripts when working with these systems.<p>This &quot;visibility&quot; pain point is exacerbated tenfold if you are working with event driven architectures and&#x2F;or event sourcing - you must have a way to search and replay events as you will need to rebuild state in order to bring up new data stores and services. That may sound straightforward, but it&#x27;s actually really involved. You have to figure out how and where to store your events, how to serialize them, search them, play them back, and how&#x2F;when&#x2F;if to prune, delete or archive them.<p>Rather than spending a ton of money on building such a replay platform in-house, we decided to build a generic one and hopefully save everyone a bunch of time and money. We are 100% believers in &quot;buy&quot; (vs &quot;build&quot;) - companies should focus on building their core product and not waste time on sidequests. We&#x27;ve worked on these systems before at our previous gigs and decided to put our combined experience into building Batch.<p>A friend of mine shared this bit of insight with me (that he heard from Dave Cheney, I think?) - &quot;Is this what you want to spend your innovation tokens on?&quot; (referring to building something in-house) - and the answer is probably... no. So this is how we got here!<p>In practical terms, we give you a &quot;connector&quot; (in the form of a Docker image) that hooks into your messaging system as a consumer and begins copying all data that it sees on a topic&#x2F;exchange to Batch. Alternatively, you can pump data into our platform via a generic HTTP or gRPC API. Once the messages reach Batch, we index them and write them to a long-term store (we use <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elassandra.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elassandra.io</a>). At that point, you can use either our UI or HTTP API to search and replay a subset of the messages to an HTTP destination or into another messaging system.<p>Right now, our platform is able to ingest data from Kafka, RabbitMQ and GCP PubSub, and we&#x27;ve got SQS on the roadmap. Really, we&#x27;re cool with adding support for whatever messaging system you need as long as it solves a problem for you.<p>One super cool thing is that if you are encoding your events in protobuf, we are able to decode them upon arrival on our platform, so that we can index them and let you search for data within them. In fact, we think this functionality is so cool that we really wanted to share it - surely there are other folks that need to quickly read&#x2F;write encoded data to various messaging systems. We wrote <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;batchcorp&#x2F;plumber\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;batchcorp&#x2F;plumber</a> for that purpose. It&#x27;s like curl for messaging systems and currently supports Kafka, RabbitMQ and GCP PubSub. It&#x27;s a port from an internal tool we used when interacting with our own Kafka and RabbitMQ instances.<p>In closing, we would love for you to check out <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;batch.sh\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;batch.sh</a> and tell us what you think. Our initial thinking is to allow folks to pump their data into us for free with 1-3 days of retention. If you need more retention, that&#x27;ll require $ (we&#x27;re leaning towards a usage-based pricing model).<p>We envision Batch becoming a foundational component of your system architecture, but right now, our #1 goal is to lower the barrier to entry for event sourcing and we think that offering &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; replay functionality is the first step towards making this happen.<p>.. And if event sourcing is not your cup of tea - then you can get us in your stack to gain visibility and a peace of mind.<p>OK that&#x27;s it! Thank you for checking us out!<p>~Dan &amp; Ustin<p>P.S. Forgot about our creds:<p>I (Dan), spent a large chunk of my career working at data centers doing systems integration work. I got exposed to all kinds of esoteric things like how to integrate diesel generators into CMSs and automate VLAN provisioning for customers. I also learned that &quot;move fast and break things&quot; does not apply to data centers haha. After data centers, I went to work for New Relic, followed by InVision, Digital Ocean and most recently, Community (which is where I met Ustin). I work primarily in Go, consider myself a generalist, prefer light beers over IPAs and dabble in metal (music) production.<p>Ustin is a physicist turned computer scientist and worked towards a PhD on distributed storage over lossy networks. He has spent most of his career working as a founding engineer at startups like Community. He has a lot of experience working in Elixir and Go and working on large, complex systems.","time":1597678429,"title":"Launch HN: Batch (YC S20) – Replays for event-driven systems","type":"story"},{"by":"Pneumaticat","descendants":70,"id":24188172,"kids":[24192390,24192138,24194199,24190179,24190582,24191035,24191696,24194760,24190441,24192289,24192810,24191116,24190373,24190313,24190206,24193338],"score":165,"time":1597678173,"title":"Using a Yubikey as a touchless, magic unlock key for Linux","type":"story","url":"https://kliu.io/post/yubico-magic-unlock/"},{"by":"jqcoffey","descendants":342,"id":24188135,"kids":[24188466,24189416,24189413,24194601,24191826,24193758,24194191,24195359,24194679,24193478,24191061,24194377,24192817,24193388,24195022,24195848,24196040,24189389,24193282,24191804,24193376,24194582,24192769,24193295,24188384,24195823,24193204,24188475,24189279],"score":189,"time":1597677860,"title":"Rolling blackouts in California have power experts stumped","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/16/business/california-blackouts.html"},{"by":"smusamashah","dead":true,"id":24188056,"kids":[24188082,24188074],"score":1,"time":1597677327,"title":"College student used GPT-3 to write fake blog and ended up at top of Hacker News","type":"story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/16/21371049/gpt3-hacker-news-ai-blog"},{"by":"dsr12","descendants":139,"id":24188098,"kids":[24188330,24188412,24189878,24188517,24189681,24188522,24188282,24189125,24188321,24188589,24194783,24189336,24189290,24190646,24193360,24189756,24196393,24196792,24188929,24191176,24188715,24189243,24188364,24188873,24190430,24189234,24189412,24188465,24188371,24192297,24188297,24190196],"score":254,"time":1597677603,"title":"Artificial eyespots on cattle reduce predation by large carnivores","type":"story","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-01156-0"},{"by":"thomasfromcdnjs","descendants":60,"id":24187794,"kids":[24188004,24188615,24188455,24189140,24188143,24188107,24188108,24188187,24196075,24194766,24192794,24195814,24209539,24188045,24188910,24188408,24188520,24188640,24187998,24188162,24199119,24194022,24188866],"score":102,"text":"For those who don&#x27;t know, the Australian Aboriginal flag (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;sGsnLkv.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;sGsnLkv.png</a>) is actually copy-righted by an individual although it is recognized as a national flag.<p>It was created in 1971 by an artist named Harold Thomas and went onto to become culturally accepted as the flag of the Aboriginal people.

Very often you get frustrated with the quality and rollback your project&#x27;s state. Instead of wasting time for that, we invented something new. You can check UI components from popular libraries in one app - Awesome Libs!<p>For 90% of libraries listed in the app you can use a demo screen.

There is an actual need for it - Since it&#x27;s something that I want to bring me decent income one day, it should be marketable. I can&#x27;t just create something and hope people will like it. Also, not in an over-saturated market. The world doesn&#x27;t really need another dating app, or another todo-list app. 2. It is fun to implement - It should be exciting to work on. For example, finance-related software can be a money-maker, but I find it utterly boring. I don&#x27;t want to dread working on my own side project. 3. I can work on it on my own - I want it to be something I can create the foundations of on my own - not something I need partners from the start. I would only involve more people when the project reaches maturity.<p>All of the ideas I&#x27;ve had so far cover only 2 of the 3 criteria.<p>When I start working on a project that covers only 1 or 2 of the 3 criteria, I immediately give up on it and start searching for another one.<p>My current job involves work on Android, but it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;m particularly passioinate, so that fails criteria 2.<p>In terms of my interests, there&#x27;s entertainment (movies and video games), healthy living (workouts, gym, diets), travelling, educational videos, MOOCs, 3D printing, 3D graphics.

I can understand what they mean if they use &quot;shill&quot;, but using the word &quot;bot&quot; means to me that the original poster is an autonomous web scraper or automatic program to vigorously defend or attack something. But the thing is, even if there is a nation-state-coordinated agenda to subvert online opinion, these things are still being conducted by real people, which I am fairly certain are still just regular humans.

GPT-3 also doesn&#x27;t typically make typos, nonconformist &quot;nicely formatted&quot; writing of humans, or use new information too well.<p>My conclusion then is that real people are pushing their viewpoints still, not &quot;bots&quot;, but I may be misunderstanding the way the term is used.

What I am finding is that the people who are screening&#x2F;interviewing me know nothing about me, despite many of them reaching out to me directly. Why does this seem to be common?<p>I&#x27;ve made an extra effort to make sure my online portfolio documents things that I&#x27;ve built in a clear and concise way, but the traffic analytics on my portfolio tells the same story: nobody is investigating things I&#x27;ve worked on before they interview me.<p>In the interviews themselves, very few people have mentioned anything I&#x27;ve worked on, even when immediately relevant to the conversation. I&#x27;ll ask if they saw &quot;X&quot;, which shows my experience around the thing we&#x27;re talking about, to which the response is always &quot;no&quot;. The silver lining is, yes, it&#x27;s an opportunity to talk about it now.<p>Am I being too self-centered to want this? I feel like my successes&#x2F;failures in the interviews come from my ability to sum up my professional experience in 60 seconds, which is why I&#x27;ve gone through the efforts to have a strong online portfolio in the first place. I can understand that people are busy at work, and so they probably put minimal effort into the interview preparation, but to base their decisions about me on <i>only</i> an hour&#x27;s worth of programming puzzles—without considering the body of software I have produced and made easy to review—feels dismissive to what I offer as a candidate.","time":1597546033,"title":"Ask HN: Is it common for interviewers to know nothing about you?","type":"story"},{"by":"etxm","descendants":6,"id":24174400,"kids":[24175146,24180048,24174416,24175306],"score":4,"time":1597545328,"title":"You Can Mark 'Fire Tornado' Off Your 2020 Apocalypse Bingo Card","type":"story","url":"https://earther.gizmodo.com/you-can-mark-fire-tornado-off-your-2020-apocalypse-bing-1844739302"},{"by":"hirundo","descendants":369,"id":24174276,"kids":[24174532,24175348,24175170,24179379,24175206,24175385,24175630,24174600,24176771,24178147,24175232,24176525,24174932,24175466,24177554,24178509,24180565,24174918,24176017,24175956,24175496,24177357,24178351,24176983,24174367,24177304,24175196,24194259,24175678,24175916,24185347,24175973,24182874,24188671,24174404,24175422,24175122,24176172],"score":716,"time":1597544070,"title":"Amazon Liable for Defective Third-Party Products Rules CA Appellate Court","type":"story","url":"https://californiaglobe.com/section-2/amazon-liable-for-defective-third-party-products-rules-ca-appelate-court/"},{"by":"elliekelly","descendants":375,"id":24174265,"kids":[24174770,24175649,24174629,24175494,24174529,24188248,24174642,24174489,24174954,24174801,24175424,24175071,24174568,24174408,24175650,24174661,24174669,24174530,24174935,24174522,24174583,24174472,24175377,24174645,24178461,24174485,24174506,24174841,24175333,24174433,24174839,24174879,24174396,24174543,24174587,24174756],"score":325,"time":1597543945,"title":"Trump says he is considering pardon for Edward Snowden","type":"story","url":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-snowden/trump-says-hes-considering-pardon-for-leaker-edward-snowden-idUSKCN25B10Z"},{"by":"avery42","descendants":5,"id":24174264,"kids":[24175522,24175069,24175143],"score":15,"time":1597543934,"title":"Maybe Your Sleep Problem Isn’t a Problem","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/25/style/sleep-problem-late-night.html"},{"by":"basicplus2","descendants":5,"id":24174246,"kids":[24179857,24176155,24178673],"score":32,"time":1597543671,"title":"Thanks to Time Dilation, Earth’s Core Is 2.5 Years Younger Than Its Surface","type":"story","url":"https://futurism.com/thanks-to-time-dilation-earths-core-is-2-5-years-younger-than-its-surface"},{"by":"tazedsoul","descendants":27,"id":24174155,"kids":[24174696,24178068,24175085,24179216,24175822,24175010,24174695,24182280,24174156,24176920,24175190,24180378,24176300],"score":29,"time":1597542789,"title":"A joke about the difference between mathematicians and physicists","type":"story","url":"http://www.thingspondered.xyz/2020/08/excerpt-man-who-loved-only-numbers.html"},{"by":"woldemariam","descendants":94,"id":24173931,"kids":[24174284,24175643,24174767,24177387,24175163,24174705,24176519],"score":131,"time":1597540348,"title":"The machines USPS is removing can sort more than 36,000 pieces of mail per hour","type":"story","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/usps-mail-sorting-machines-how-they-work-in-photos-2020-8"},{"by":"apsec112","descendants":11,"id":24173825,"kids":[24177266,24176987,24180154,24177376,24179133],"score":36,"time":1597539294,"title":"The ELIZA Effect (2019)","type":"story","url":"https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-eliza-effect/"},{"by":"codingmeche","descendants":4,"id":24173750,"kids":[24177415,24181553,24174910],"score":2,"text":"I was wondering if anyone knew of any areas of cs where people with backgrounds in mechanical engineering who can also code are needed&#x2F;work?

Do you find it a product that you would like to use? Discussion on features are also very welcome.<p>The product is to solve some problems I experienced when using Google BigQuery:<p>(1) Cost saving. There are quite a few common, well-known “best practices” that a self-hosted web UI can easily enforce to save cost, for example discourage users from using “SELECT *” [1]. But to me it would be hard to imagine Google actually adds this feature to their own BigQuery UI, since they are getting paid when users don&#x27;t follow the &quot;best practices&quot;.<p>(2) Allow users to add links to the UI. For example, I think many companies would like to add links of internal guidelines on how to use BigQuery and how to find datasets.<p>(3) Keyboard shortcuts.

Hence, my worry of slowing down the team by being involved in development myself.","time":1597503843,"title":"Ask HN: As CTO of an early-stage startup, how do I utilize my time well?","type":"story"},{"by":"fortran77","descendants":50,"id":24169316,"kids":[24171236,24171183,24172391,24185974,24176862,24171497,24176197],"score":109,"time":1597503388,"title":"ATM Hackers Have Picked Up Some Clever New Tricks","type":"story","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/atm-hackers-jackpotting-remote-malware/"},{"by":"greatwave1","descendants":5,"id":24169279,"kids":[24169282,24170816],"score":9,"time":1597503006,"title":"Show HN: Dashboard for tracking insider trading at S&P 500 companies","type":"story","url":"https://www.quiverquant.com/insidertrading/"},{"by":"reikonomusha","descendants":119,"id":24169237,"kids":[24169502,24169694,24169625,24170099,24170039,24169818,24169666,24170503,24170963,24169385,24171129,24169809,24169763,24169855,24171021,24169885,24170568,24169692,24169783,24170203,24169673,24169961,24170169,24175168,24169425],"score":119,"time":1597502720,"title":"My One Day at Recurse Center","type":"story","url":"http://cadlag.org/posts/on-showing-up-to-school-in-your-underwear.html"},{"by":"pmoriarty","descendants":10,"id":24169221,"kids":[24170281,24170583,24170343,24170372],"score":13,"time":1597502571,"title":"What America can learn from the fall of the Roman republic","type":"story","url":"https://www.vox.com/2019/1/1/18139787/rome-decline-america-edward-watts-mortal-republic"},{"by":"jeffreygoesto","descendants":111,"id":24169121,"kids":[24169733,24169495,24169399,24169775,24170166,24169546,24170031,24169525,24169944,24169513,24169536,24169674],"score":72,"time":1597501768,"title":"Not enough foreigners applied for H1B visas this year, govt ran a second lottery","type":"story","url":"https://www.theregister.com/2020/08/14/h1b_second_lottery/"},{"by":"InInteraction","descendants":31,"id":24169065,"kids":[24171058,24170646,24170257,24170490,24171891,24170324,24170822,24170478],"score":142,"time":1597501402,"title":"Psychedelic drugs reduce depressive symptoms by helping people accept emotions","type":"story","url":"https://www.psypost.org/2020/08/psychedelic-drugs-reduce-depressive-symptoms-by-helping-individuals-to-accept-of-their-emotions-study-suggests-57654"},{"by":"Yetanfou","descendants":17,"id":24168880,"kids":[24172257,24171697,24173529,24172373,24173010,24175785,24176100,24175818,24171692,24172827],"score":130,"time":1597499833,"title":"Russell Kirsch, inventor of the pixel, has died","type":"story","url":"https://petapixel.com/2020/08/13/russell-kirsch-inventor-of-the-pixel-passed-away-this-week/"},{"by":"peridotoak","descendants":255,"id":24168902,"kids":[24169684,24172292,24170750,24169147,24169240,24169288,24171516,24169753,24169198,24171295,24169275,24170480,24169756,24170303,24170392,24171565,24170047,24170661,24169283,24169609,24169255,24169123,24173964,24170570,24172697,24173254,24170790,24169631,24169828,24169224,24169529,24172082,24172621,24171800,24170399,24182458,24169400,24169483,24171572,24173051,24170393,24169494,24171068,24171469,24171376,24173733,24169120,24170737,24171290,24169375,24169081,24178497,24170692,24176651,24176673,24169063,24169501,24176714,24173568,24171695,24187893,24306100,24306108,24173333,24169252,24169520,24169262,24169488,24169486,24169285,24169197],"score":229,"text":"For a few years now, there&#x27;s been a rising tide of activism and talk of capitalism 2.0 -- is anyone actually riding this wave, or is it mostly talk?<p>If anyone is actively working on (or with) a social enterprise, or if you know of any, I&#x27;d really appreciate it if you can loop me in!<p>Thank you in advance!","time":1597500028,"title":"Ask HN: Anyone a social entrepreneur, i.e. placing social impact above profit?","type":"story"},{"by":"sahin-boydas","descendants":11,"id":24168867,"kids":[24170205,24170357,24169605,24169554,24168915,24169919],"score":19,"time":1597499735,"title":"Trump Signs Executive Order Giving ByteDance 90 Days to Sell US TikTok Business","type":"story","url":"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/15/tiktok-90-days/"},{"by":"m3at","descendants":17,"id":24168799,"kids":[24170415,24172129],"score":50,"time":1597499036,"title":"Intel Xe-LP GPU Architecture Deep Dive","type":"story","url":"https://www.anandtech.com/show/15973/the-intel-xelp-gpu-architecture-deep-dive-building-up-from-the-bottom"},{"by":"mettamage","descendants":62,"id":24168590,"kids":[24168712,24168674,24168663,24168679,24168943,24168706,24168658,24169100,24168997,24169105,24168958,24168770,24168899,24169116,24168814,24169217,24168747],"score":56,"text":"I sometimes interviewed for US companies that stated they will hire an accepted candidate as a remote contractor first,  then get the H1B visa process started and relocate within 6 to 24 months.<p>Is this legal?<p>If so, why don’t more US companies do this?

(<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tella.tv&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tella.tv&#x2F;</a>) is a collaborative online video editor for screen and camera recordings. We&#x27;re making video creation accessible to people who have no prior editing experience.<p>Sharing screen and camera recordings is a rapidly growing way for people to communicate at work, especially in technology where the subject matter is often on screens (new features, code, designs). But while people are creating more video for work, it&#x27;s usually for the convenience of the creator and not the viewer. One-take screen recordings can be long, boring, and difficult to watch. We&#x27;re trying to change this by letting people produce and edit their recordings so that it&#x27;s a better experience for viewers.<p>Michiel and I used to work at a large remote company and this was where we saw the potential of edited video content in the workplace. One of the biggest challenges was keeping business teams up-to-date with product teams. The most effective solution was product teams sharing videos about their work over Slack, which the rest of the organisation watched in their own time. Product teams made videos about new projects, progress updates, launches, user research, and so on.<p>The most interesting aspect of the approach was that the videos weren&#x27;t just screen recordings, they were edited and often well-produced videos. The better the production, the better the engagement was. Teams approached the production of these videos in the same way as preparing a slide deck for a presentation.<p>We loved the format and saw its potential, especially in a remote workplace, but it had some problems. Video editing is time consuming, and working on a video with a teammate takes even longer. Video editing also has a high barrier to entry. Purchasing Screenflow or Final Cut (or other long-format editors) and then learning how to use it prohibits people from trying video as a form of sharing information.<p>So we set out to build a video editor that focuses on screen and camera recording (where most of the subject matter comes from at work), allows for collaboration (many people work in teams and expect the tools they use to support this), and makes editing straightforward (putting together a video should be as simple as putting together a slide deck).<p>Our implementation takes a different approach to most editors. We wanted something that was fast, lightweight, and could run in a web browser—appealing to people completely new to video editing. We also wanted to support real-time collaboration. Instead of transcoding all content to a video format, we created our own video player that controls the timing and display of HTML elements. Let&#x27;s say your video consists of a couple recordings, some text, and some images. Tella plots these different bits of content on a timeline and then plays them back in sequence on a webpage.<p>The benefit of this is that we can use anything that you can do with HTML, CSS and JS to create a video. We&#x27;re not bound to ffmpeg or other transcoders to generate our video for us. We take the document the user created and display that in the same way to the viewer (no converting step in between). This means we can stay lightweight and let you update the video whenever you like. There are no “snapshots” stored and the link always shows the source of truth.<p>The challenge with this is keeping all the content in sync. Using our earlier example: the first recording should play after the text and then the second recording exactly after the first ends. A more complex scenario would be where two videos need to play back at the same time: a screen recording and a camera recording—these need to start and stop at the same moments. This is called “Media Synchronization”, or MediaSync for short (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.springer.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;book&#x2F;9783319658391\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.springer.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;book&#x2F;9783319658391</a>). At the moment browsers don’t have a lot of stable APIs that can help us, but they are in the works! One notable example is the Timing Object (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webtiming.github.io&#x2F;timingobject&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webtiming.github.io&#x2F;timingobject&#x2F;</a>) which outlines how you can sync multiple media elements to the same clock. Right now Tella mostly works by manually syncing all video elements on actions like “play” or “seek”. Eventually we want to implement more of the techniques outlined in MediaSync, like slightly changing the speed of out of sync videos to let them catch up.<p>So far, people have been using Tella to create product demos, team updates, company announcements, sales pitches, investor pitches, and tutorial videos, as well as making video content for blogs and newsletters.<p>We&#x27;d love to hear what you think and answer any questions you might have.

everyone,<p>I’m Lily Tang from Liyfe (pronounced Life) Clinic (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;liyfeclinic.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;liyfeclinic.com</a>), which launched just one week ago. We bring clinical knowledge and support to breast cancer patients without them stepping into clinics.<p>I worked 13 years as a cancer physicist in radiation oncology. During that time, I have witnessed repeatedly the problems associated with access to care—those patients who might have been diagnosed earlier, and those whose treatments could have been more compliant, and whose post-op symptoms could have been managed more efficiently after their initial treatment.<p>In fact, the average time a cancer patient gets to talk to a doctor is only 17 minutes. Without sufficient education and communication, patients often cannot understand their home instruction completely, and consequently their compliance is inadequate. All these affect treatment outcome. I wanted to change this situation.<p>If no one enjoys the process of hospital visits, and doctors don’t have enough time to communicate with patients, how about creating a telemedicine platform? It can offer 24&#x2F;7 access to personalized cancer consultation and support. This is how Liyfe Clinic began.<p>I met Sherry two years ago. We quickly became friends, and soon co-founders. Sherry started to build a HIPAA compliant platform for patient and doctor communication, including iOS, Android, and web versions. The platform has native HIPAA compliant communication infrastructure across all versions. It supports text, image, and video messaging, and file transfers. We also have video chat solution on top of WebRTC.<p>Many cancer patients need to see multiple doctors from multiple facilities, either at the same time or over some years. It is important for them to have a centralized place to store all of their medical records. This way, patients can easily share the records with all doctors—to improve communication efficiency and avoid potential medical mistakes. Therefore, we built a mini EHR system. Patients can upload and organize their profiles and medical records and choose whom they want to share.<p>Currently we focus on breast cancer and offer two types of services: virtual office visits and Liyfe membership. For virtual office visits, patients can choose to get a treatment second opinion, talk to a doctor, nutrition coaching, and emotional support. Once a service is chosen, we will match the patient with a provider, and then the provider can virtually see the patient using the video chat on our platform.<p>The membership program was developed recently after we talked to many patients. What patients really want and need is to be able to access a personalized professional help, anytime, anywhere. The membership program allows patient to text chat with a designated nurse practitioner (NP). Texting is a very low threshold access to care, and it lowers many barriers (fear, expense, inconvenience, time lost from work) to personalized professional care. Most patient questions can be answered by an NP. If there is a need to talk to a doctor or other specialists, the NP will triage that.<p>For long term, we would like work with local hospitals to provide a complete cancer service to patients—hospitals will take care of patients when they are at hospitals, and we will take care the rest.<p>If any of these situations resonates your or your family and friends’ experience, we’d love to hear your thoughts.","time":1597328370,"title":"Launch HN: Liyfe Clinic (YC S20) – Telemedicine for breast cancer","type":"story"},{"by":"zdw","descendants":32,"id":24143434,"kids":[24146504,24154355,24150951,24145239],"score":119,"time":1597327433,"title":"How the ARM32 Linux kernel decompresses","type":"story","url":"https://people.kernel.org/linusw/how-the-arm32-linux-kernel-decompresses"},{"by":"jetheredge","descendants":66,"id":24143361,"kids":[24144383,24144340,24144248,24144399,24144912,24144547,24144474,24144925,24144779,24144751,24144795,24145649,24144391,24144842,24144199,24145017,24144746],"score":69,"time":1597327026,"title":"Serverless: I'm a Big Kid Now","type":"story","url":"https://www.simplethread.com/serverless-im-a-big-kid-now/"},{"by":"simonpure","descendants":3,"id":24143309,"kids":[24143751,24143477],"score":2,"time":1597326718,"title":"Elon Musk's Emoji Profile","type":"story","url":"https://emojigraph.org/blog/elon-musk-emoji/"},{"by":"bdz","descendants":359,"id":24143346,"kids":[24144247,24144310,24144015,24144700,24145663,24144603,24144332,24144749,24144667,24144256,24144608,24145031,24146818,24144033,24143362,24146968,24144637,24145855,24144984,24144687,24147299,24145108,24144441,24144505,24148943,24147568,24144565,24145350,24146925,24146176,24145067,24145670,24145151,24145390,24144643,24144884,24145682,24144836,24150193],"score":414,"time":1597326931,"title":"Epic direct payment on mobile","type":"story","url":"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/the-fortnite-mega-drop-permanent-discounts-up-to-20-percent"},{"by":"EndXA","descendants":6,"id":24143189,"kids":[24143849,24143597,24143436,24143270],"score":12,"time":1597325856,"title":"AMA with the Creator of Photopea","type":"story","url":"https://reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/i8j5te/i_made_a_free_alternative_to_photoshop_that_is/"},{"by":"artur_makly","descendants":3,"id":24143154,"kids":[24143208,24143283],"score":2,"text":"I&#x27;m in FB Kafka Hell.<p>Yesterday my basic comment was flagged by FB&#x27;s AI yesterday as harassment and bullying [1]<p>This never happened to me before.

I enjoyed the interviews and while I had my concerns, I&#x27;ve decided to give it a go.<p>The onboarding went smooth. Plenty of documentation, even though the company is not that large (&lt;1000 employees).<p>I joined a team that was building a new feature. As mentioned, designs &amp; implementation details ready. Great! I noticed very early on that you have to figure out which parts of these should actually be implemented as some of the decisions were later changed. Happens everywhere, whatever.<p>Another thing is code quality. New code here is basically legacy even before you start to write it. There is a promise that once we finish the feature, there will be time for maintenance. I believe that maintaining quality is not something that you can do with once-a-year rewrite. I don&#x27;t like it, but what can you do?<p>There is a very strong push to deliver new features and the code got pretty old. Once something is added, it shouldn&#x27;t be modified (unless you modify the behavior). This isn&#x27;t coming from PMs.<p>We use React, no hooks thou. It&#x27;s a step back for me, but whatever. Eslint for linting, but rules are often disabled. One of the reasons is that backend team uses pascal_case and we use camelCase.<p>I like when all devs write code in a similar way - using object destructuring, naming variables similarly, stuff like that. I know some of these are objective, but I&#x27;m not saying here that my way is right, let&#x27;s agree on something. Nope. Reviewers should only comment on a &quot;high level&quot; stuff, which I think everybody understands differently.<p>About 2 months ago the project was delivered.

In brief, it argues that the IT sector favors men due to unconscious bias. This got me thinking: Is it possible that unconscious bias is due to certain IT jobs benefiting (or having benefited in the past) from physical strength? For better or worse, our species features sexual dimorphism: Women are on average physically less strong than men, although intellectually at least as capable. I found that many IT jobs still benefit from physical strength: When working as a network engineer, it was beneficial to be able to lift a 120kg router (with a co-worker, of course) to install it in the rack. When working in start-ups, we often had to mount our own furniture and physical strength could reduce the number of person-hours required to complete the task. Few decades ago, computer screens were crazy heavy, even for men, and being able to put one on your desk would give you access to more screen estate, better colors and&#x2F;or higher resolutions.\nI conjecture that each instance of physical work creep gives men more opportunities. For example, a better screen a decade ago could give male graphics designer a small heads-up. Even if men do not intellectually benefit from physical work creep, it might still reinforce the stereotype: &quot;This male candidate feels more suitable for X&quot;.<p>Fortunately, if my conjecture is true, the solution is &quot;easy&quot;: Fight physical work creep, by making devices, installations, furniture, etc. more physically inclusive.<p>Could physical work creep cause unconscious bias? Have any scholars studied this issue? Are there more &#x2F; better examples of physical work creep in IT jobs?<p>P.S.: I conjecture that this issue is not restricted to IT. Non-fly-by-wire airliners, e.g., B737, require force to command the stick, which be designed to the strength of men. I would be curious to see if the proportion of female pilots on Airbus A320 is larger than on B737.","time":1597307854,"title":"Ask HN: Physical work creep in IT jobs, the root cause of unconscious bias?","type":"story"},{"by":"geek_at","descendants":161,"id":24141127,"kids":[24141948,24143707,24141422,24141598,24141851,24142274,24141658,24142424,24142983,24141487,24142267,24141635,24143029,24141285,24142452,24141348,24144473,24142963,24146916,24146889,24143520,24143749,24145967,24151903,24141191,24141606,24141240,24145770,24141300,24142937,24148682,24142527,24142815,24141501,24142045,24142342,24141351],"score":457,"time":1597307109,"title":"Stopping phishing campaigns with Bash","type":"story","url":"https://blog.haschek.at/2020/stopping-phishing-campaigns-with-bash.html"},{"by":"sohkamyung","descendants":70,"id":24141105,"kids":[24142171,24156385,24156204,24157366,24156430,24156007,24156559,24156287,24156838],"score":50,"time":1597306807,"title":"‘George Eliot’ joins 24 female authors making debuts under their real names","type":"story","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/12/george-eliot-joins-24-female-authors-making-debuts-under-their-real-names"},{"by":"vijayr02","descendants":4,"id":24140918,"kids":[24142467,24150212,24144116,24159142],"score":10,"time":1597304578,"title":"'Operation empty plate': Xi Jinping makes food waste his next target","type":"story","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/13/operation-empty-plate-xi-jinping-makes-food-waste-his-next-target"},{"by":"handlingelect","dead":true,"id":24140897,"kids":[24141095,24141071,24141060],"score":9,"time":1597304354,"title":"Is the PC the real next gen winner?","type":"story","url":"https://www.staticcatgames.com/2020/08/is-pc-real-next-generation-winner.html"},{"by":"caution","descendants":215,"id":24140848,"kids":[24141440,24141224,24143532,24141662,24141583,24141171,24144738,24144963,24141336,24141612,24145763,24141051,24141146,24143892,24143399,24141189,24141040,24142131],"score":163,"time":1597303818,"title":"\"Rust does not have a stable ABI\"","type":"story","url":"https://people.gnome.org/~federico/blog/rust-stable-abi.html"},{"by":"mlejva","descendants":97,"id":24140808,"kids":[24161547,24161453,24160038,24160376,24162978,24161231,24165531,24160249,24163184,24160350,24164924,24164979,24161132,24160234,24172404,24161008,24163647,24171099,24162624,24166529],"score":216,"time":1597303408,"title":"Entropy explained, with sheep (2016)","type":"story","url":"https://aatishb.com/entropy/"},{"by":"siscia","descendants":3,"id":24140793,"kids":[24140856,24140976,24140813],"score":6,"text":"Hi HN,<p>Mozilla was, is, and hopefully will be, a fundamental part of the web.<p>The recent round of layoffs in Mozilla is an important news for our community that deserve to be discussed.

We’re founders of Papercups (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;papercups.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;papercups.io</a>), a live customer chat app written in Elixir. We offer an open-core self-hosted alternative to Intercom for companies that are security and privacy conscientious.<p>Alex and I met in SF around 6 years ago, and have been hacking on small projects together for the past couple years. Before covid, we would spend many Sunday afternoons in coffee shops building prototypes of whatever our latest and greatest idea was… most of these fizzled out after a few weeks or so<p>For 2020, we wanted to take the idea of “building something people want” a bit more seriously. We started off trying to build SaaS tools for ocean freight logistics companies. That failed, but we learned a ton in the process.<p>After our experience in freight we wanted to work on tools that are a little closer to home and tried a completely new idea: a web app that makes it super easy to manage and deploy simple cron jobs and other recurring&#x2F;scheduled tasks.<p>One thing we learned from the feedback on this product was how difficult it can be to set up and schedule email campaigns. This definitely resonated with us since we&#x27;ve both had this pain professionally. While working at Stripe, one particularly painful project Alex worked on was setting up email campaigns to notify their customers of new regulations. I had a similar experience at Pivotal where I worked on a project to email users about security updates.<p>So we started tackling this particular pain point: setting up and managing email campaigns. A few companies already do this pretty well. Intercom is one, but it can be prohibitively expensive. And for companies that have concerns about sending their customer data to 3rd party services, these products aren’t an option.<p>At this point we figured, why not be more ambitious? Instead of just building an email campaign tool, let’s build an open core alternative to Intercom!<p>So here we are. We’re starting off with chat but we plan on expanding into email campaigns and push notifications. We chose chat to start off with because we wanted something that we could use immediately. For a lot of our previous projects, we had set up chat on our sites to engage with customers.<p>We’ve launched this repo under MIT license so any developer can use the tool. The goal is to not charge individual developers. Features like chat, canned responses, private notes, and auto assignments will stay free and open source. Right now we plan on making money by providing things like a hosted version and support contracts. We eventually plan on making a licensed version where we charge for features that large companies care about like Active Directory support, Okta integration, and compliance exports.<p>Finally we decided to build Papercups on top of Elixir&#x2F;Phoenix because it seemed like the best tool for a job that requires a lot of “realtime” functionality and first class support for websockets&#x2F;channels. It’s been great so far! The frontend uses React&#x2F;TypeScript. We may explore using LiveView in the future, but we wanted to start off with a frontend stack that we were familiar with.<p>You can check out our repo at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;papercups-io&#x2F;papercups\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;papercups-io&#x2F;papercups</a> we have a ton of features in mind would love your feedback and any feature requests!<p>P.S. This is our first time working in Elixir so would love any feedback there too!","time":1597249921,"title":"Launch HN: Papercups (YC S20) – Open-Core Intercom

The idea was to build a tool that did not require additional programming or front-end development for publishing data visualizations. \nSuch a code can be invoked from either Jupyter notebook, RMarkdown, Python, or R scripts. Once the data is pushed, it can be accessed via a browser.<p>Open-sourcing dstack:\nDuring our customer discovery phase, we realized that dstack.ai should integrate a lot more open source data science frameworks than we integrated ourselves. For example, as a user, I want to push a matplotlib plot, a Tensorflow model, a plotly chart, a pandas dataframe, and I expect the presentation layer to fully-support it. Supporting all types of artifacts and providing all the tools to work with them solely seems to be a very challenging task.\nWith this, we open-sourced the framework. Now you can build dstack locally, and run it on your servers, or in a cloud of your choice if that’s needed.\nMore details on the project, how to use it, and the source code of the server can be found at the https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dstackai&#x2F;dstack repo. The client packages for Python and R are available at the https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dstackai&#x2F;dstack-py and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dstackai&#x2F;dstack-r correspondingly.<p>What’s next:\nUser callbacks-  so that application shows not just pre-calculated visualizations but also can fetch data from a store and process it in real-time. \nML models- so that data scientists can publish a stack which binds together a pre-calculated ML model and user parameters\nUse cases- Support specific use cases that help data scientists to build data science models into data applications as fast as possible.<p>We would be happy to get your feedback on the open-source framework and also get your opinion on what kind of use cases can be built on top of the framework? \nThank you.","time":1597238060,"title":"Show HN: dstack – an open-source tool to build data applications easily","type":"story"},{"by":"tusharsoni","descendants":3,"id":24131547,"kids":[24131557,24134012],"score":2,"time":1597236816,"title":"Show HN: DropList - Send your marketing campaigns 100x cheaper","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/tusharsoni/droplist"},{"by":"ricklamers","descendants":30,"id":24131302,"kids":[24138301,24139341,24134739,24138604,24135110,24132338,24139049,24138311],"score":64,"text":"Hello Hacker News!

The tool can be considered to be high-code because you write your own Python&#x2F;R notebooks and scripts, but we manage the underlying infrastructure to make it &#x27;just work™&#x27;. You can think of it as a simplified version of Kubeflow.<p>We created Orchest to free data scientists from the tedious engineering related tasks of their job. Similar to how companies like Netflix, Uber and Booking.com support their data scientists with internal tooling and frameworks to increase productivity. When we worked as data scientists ourselves we noticed how heavily we had to depend on our software engineering skills to perform all kinds of tasks. From configuring cloud instances for distributed training, to optimizing the networking and storage for processing large amounts of data. We believe data scientists should be able to focus on the data and the domain specific challenges.<p>Today we are just at the very beginning of making better tooling available for data science and are launching our GitHub project that will give enhanced pipelining abilities to data scientists using the PyData&#x2F;R stack, with deep integration of Jupyter Notebooks.<p>Currently Orchest supports:<p>1) visually and interactively editing a pipeline that is represented using a simple JSON schema;<p>2) running remote container based kernels through the Jupyter Enterprise Gateway integration;<p>3) scheduling experiments by launching parameterized pipelines on top of our Celery task scheduler;<p>4) configuring local and remote data sources to separate code versioning from the data passing through your pipelines.<p>We are here to learn and get feedback from the community.

Xkit helps developers build and maintain native integrations by turning OAuth for 25 of the most popular SaaS apps into a single API call that always returns fresh access tokens.<p>I went through YC two years ago in S18 (and some of you may have seen our launch) with Sparkswap, a trust-minimized bitcoin exchange. After a year and half of building that product and building up a small but loyal following, I made the hard decision to shut it down. The audience for a trust-minimized service like Sparkswap was too niche and the regulatory costs were too high. It felt like the only way to stay in that business would be to compromise on some of our core principles (e.g. go after gambling behavior, play regulatory games), so I decided to stop working in crypto and move to FinTech more broadly.<p>While doing customer discovery for a more traditional FinTech service, I encountered a pretty common request: integrations to the SaaS products my prospective customers were already using. As I was implementing OAuth with a slight variation for the 5th time, I realized I was re-writing code that thousands of other developers (probably including a bunch of people here) have already written (and debugged, and maintained).<p>So I stopped working on that FinTech service (for those keeping score at home, yes that&#x27;s two pivots) and started building a tool to let you outsource the pain of authorizing 3rd party apps with a particular focus on OAuth. From my perspective, for an integration to really be native, it will probably be faster and easier to just write some code instead of fighting against a GUI. But my goal was to make sure that nearly every line of code you write is actually <i>for your integration</i>, not authorization boilerplate.<p>Two years and two pivots after I went through YC, I&#x27;m excited to share Xkit: the tool I wanted when I was building native integrations.<p>Xkit is really two things: 1) An end-user experience for viewing and connecting 3rd party apps, and 2) An API for retrieving always-fresh access tokens.<p>To make the first work, we establish a session with your user by piggy-backing on your existing authentication method (e.g. you send us their current JWT, and we validate it). From there, we can handle the OAuth dance: CSRF&#x2F;state tokens, scope handling, callbacks, etc. For the end-user UI, we have a pre-built integration catalog to give your users an interface to browse your integrations, connect new ones, and repair broken ones. In fact, our integrations page (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkit.co&#x2F;integrations\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkit.co&#x2F;integrations</a>) is just our pre-built catalog rendered directly on our Webflow site. If you want more control over the experience you can do that too: our xkit.js library has all the tools for you to quickly build your own catalog without having to dig into OAuth.<p>For the API, just call it with the ID of the user and the name of the service, and we return a non-expired access token. You can call it from any backend process: a cloud function&#x2F;lambda, a microservice, or a monolithic server. This makes your integration code a lot simpler: one API call using one API key rather than storing, encrypting, and refreshing tokens. You can even get access tokens on the front-end if you have a valid user session, so if you&#x27;re building a front-end only app you no longer have to even think about whether a specific provider implements PKCE (looking at you, Atlassian).<p>We already work with over 25 of the most popular SaaS apps (Intercom and Zendesk added just last week!) and setting each one up typically just involves plugging in your OAuth credentials.<p>Imagine you had a team at your company that were experts in all the weird (sometimes undocumented) ways that various providers extend the OAuth spec, and they built an internal service that does all that stuff The Right Way™, lets you move it out of your core applications, and still gives PM and Design flexibility on the integration experience. That&#x27;s Xkit.<p>You can get a free dev account (up to 10 users) to try it out here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.xkit.co&#x2F;sign-up\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.xkit.co&#x2F;sign-up</a>, and if you send me an email (trey@) telling me that you came from this post, I&#x27;ll give you 50% off your first year of the Startup or Pro plans.

I&#x27;m a university student just finishing up an ML research internship with a government contractor and I am desperate for advice. Most career advice I see is geared towards maximizing comp, which is definitely nice and all, but I find I relate better with what I imagine are the hackers of old, with their slightly irrational passion,  creativity, and taste for the eccentric. Working for the government was an awesome experience; it is the closest I have gotten to what I imagine bell labs was like.<p>I&#x27;m wondering, though, what am I missing? Working for a startup sounds like so much fun, especially since I love wearing many hats and the idea of constantly learning about unrelated foci. In addition, it seems like FAANG companies advertise something similar by allowing employees to choose their work. However, I also see many posts about startups&#x27; financial downsides.

Rally is a video application that makes it easy to hop between breakout conversations. Users can see and hear other conversations around them, as if they were in a shared space.<p>We started Rally because we needed to host a virtual birthday party, and existing solutions suck for larger groups. At the same time, we noticed bars and restaurants closing, and wanted to build a platform that emulated these physical spaces. With that in mind, we added venues, rooms, and tables. A venue (like a bar or banquet hall) can consist of multiple rooms (like a patio, DJ lounge etc). Each room can fit 35 people, and people can form tables (groups) in a room organically. Tables could have up to 9 people, and can be joined with a simple click. Users can create multiple rooms, allowing for events of all sizes, and we are working quickly to expand the capacity of each room.<p>What’s magical about this is how much more it feels like a real party, as opposed to feeling like a meeting. Instead of being stuck in a giant gallery view or siloed into breakout rooms, you are free to switch between tables and rooms as you like. Instead of everyone being on mute, you can choose to vibe off of the audible laughter and chatter from neighbouring tables in the room. You can also create private tables for more personal conversations and take the stage to present to everyone around you.<p>Since launching, people have used our platform for happy hours, team socials, hackathons, brainstorming sessions, conference networking, trade shows, virtual parties, and community gatherings. We know a lot of people are using Zoom breakout rooms for these types of events. Those work fine for board meetings, training, structured workshops and interviews. We think our platform is more valuable when you want less structure and a more social element. Simply put, if you want spontaneity, our platform works. If you want formal structure, use the other tools.<p>Rally is a web app, with video being streamed using WebRTC - so no plugin installation is required. It works best on Desktop Chrome. We are also working on a mobile version - coming soon.<p>I am really excited to share our startup with the Hacker News community. I have tried and failed at building a number of companies, and reading a lot of the content here has helped recharge my batteries and helped me keep going.<p>We are free for anyone to use until the end of August. We are still testing out different use cases and seeing where demand for our product is the strongest. I recognize the space is competitive, and would appreciate your feedback on our product. We’d be grateful if you tried it out for yourself, or joined us for one of our happy hours today or this week.  We’d be super grateful if you’d be willing to try it out with a group of 6 or more people, maybe with your work team, and letting us know what you think!<p>Start your own room by visiting <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rally.video\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rally.video</a><p>Attend a happy hour by signing up here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eventbrite.ca&#x2F;e&#x2F;happy-hour-at-rally-bar-tickets-116186802855\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eventbrite.ca&#x2F;e&#x2F;happy-hour-at-rally-bar-tickets-...</a>","time":1597069198,"title":"Launch HN: Rally.Video (YC S20) – Dynamic video platform for social groups","type":"story"},{"by":"sleepyshift","descendants":162,"id":24109565,"kids":[24109887,24113384,24110226,24109728,24110243,24110985,24113733,24109912,24109874,24109804,24109756,24109660,24110271,24113559,24109979,24110876,24110782,24112595,24109943,24113688,24109784,24136357],"score":164,"time":1597069467,"title":"Boeing 747s receive software updates over floppy disks","type":"story","url":"https://www.theregister.com/2020/08/10/boeing_747_floppy_drive_updates_walkthrough/"},{"by":"rafiki6","descendants":3,"id":24109506,"kids":[24109900,24109690],"score":1,"text":"I&#x27;m an early 30s SWE with a MSc Data Science recently completed.

However, the conversation became a version of Who&#x27;s On First when we tried to understand what the issue was and what we needed to change. We just got quoted the rule section. When we gave examples of a dozen other apps with similar features, and in the store, we were told “Our app store is a private store.” In other words, our rules and we apply them as we want. We even asked to just tell us what to change and we’ll change it, but were told, “Oh, we can’t tell you that.”<p>So around we go again.

this site is that it is too easy to get down-voted if people disagree or you are wrong. The assumption is, the up-votes from agreement will cancel out the down-votes from disagreement, but there is still negative Brownian drift.

Someone who gets a bad product on Amazon is more likely to leave a negative review than leave a positive review if they are satisfied. There are so many times where people may want to comment on something but fear getting a barrage of down-votes.

HN,<p>This is Cesar Talledo and Rodny Molina, co-founders of Nestybox (www.nestybox.com).<p>Nestybox has developed a new container runtime that sits under Docker&#x2F;containerd (it&#x27;s a new type of runc) and enables containers to act as virtual-servers capable of running software such as systemd, Docker, and Kubernetes, easily and with proper isolation.<p>The motivation came from noticing that containers are great at running microservices but struggle to run system-level software in them such as those mentioned above. That is, in order to run such software in a container, we needed unsecure privileged containers with complex images, custom entrypoints, volume mounts, etc., or alternatively a heavier virtual machine. This did not seem right.<p>We studied the problem and noticed that the container abstraction was not complete enough, meaning that inside the container a root process lacked capabilities to perform certain low-level operations, the namespacing of procfs and sysfs had a few holes, there are limitations for running overlayfs-on-overlayfs, and more.<p>To solve this, we decided to create a new container runtime that would set up the container in such a way that it could run system software easily and without resorting to privileged containers. That is, a user should be able to do &quot;docker run -it some-image&quot; and get a container inside of which she can run systemd, dockerd, or even K8s without problem (much as if it were a virtual machine).<p>After lots of long days, we came up with Sysbox. It&#x27;s a new type of &quot;runc&quot; and sits below OCI-based container managers (e.g., Docker&#x2F;containerd). You typically don&#x27;t interact with Sysbox directly, but rather use Docker (or similar) to launch the containers. Sysbox was forked from the excellent OCI runc in early 2019 and has undergone significant changes since then. It uses OS virtualization techniques such as always enabling the Linux user namespace, uid shifting via shiftfs, partial virtualization of procfs and sysfs, selective syscall trapping in user-space, setting up special mounts into the container, and more. It&#x27;s written in Go.<p>Here is a video: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asciinema.org&#x2F;a&#x2F;kkTmOxl8DhEZiM2fLZNFlYzbo?speed=1.75\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asciinema.org&#x2F;a&#x2F;kkTmOxl8DhEZiM2fLZNFlYzbo?speed=1.75</a><p>Today we are happy to announce that we are open-sourcing Sysbox (Apache 2.0). You can find it at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nestybox&#x2F;sysbox\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nestybox&#x2F;sysbox</a> . We welcome users and contributors, as it has plenty of room to grow and improve. There are plenty of docs in the repo describing how to use it and how it works.<p>We think Sysbox is a very useful tool to expand the use cases for containers and provides an alternative to virtual machines in many scenarios, particularly for dev environments, testing, CI&#x2F;CD, and even running legacy apps in containers.<p>In order to pay the bills, Nestybox (the company we founded) will sell a version of Sysbox called Sysbox Enterprise Edition (Sysbox-EE). We are using an open-core model, such that Sysbox-EE is based on the open-source Sysbox and adds a layer of proprietary enterprise level features.

My name is Gleb. I&#x27;m here with my co-founder Alex to tell you \nabout our company Datafold (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datafold.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datafold.com</a>). Datafold lets you diff\nlarge datasets for fast and powerful regression testing. We support\ndatabases such as PostgreSQL, Snowflake, BigQuery, and Redshift.<p>One of the biggest pain points in developing ETL pipelines – \nchains of jobs that move, clean, merge and aggregate analytical data – \nhas been regression testing: verifying how a change in source code (mostly,\nSQL) affects the produced data.<p>Early in my career, as an on-call data engineer at Lyft, I\naccidentally introduced a breaking code change while attempting to\nship a hotfix at 4AM to a SQL job that computed tables for core\nbusiness analytics. A seemingly small change in filtering logic ended\nup corrupting data for all downstream pipelines and breaking\ndashboards for the entire company. Apart from being a silly mistake,\nthis highlighted the lack of proper tooling for testing changes. If\nthere had been a way to quickly compare the data computed by\nproduction code vs. the hotfix branch, I would have immediately\nspotted the alarming divergence and avoided merging the breaking\nchange.<p>Without a diffing tool, the typical options for regression testing\nare: (1) Data “unit tests” (e.g. check primary key uniqueness, ensure\nvalues are within interval, etc.) – these are helpful, but costly \ninvestment. Frameworks such as dbt make it easier, but it’s\noften still prohibitively hard to verify all assumptions in a large\ntable. (2) Write custom SQL queries to compare data produced by the\nprod and dev versions of the source code (e.g. compare counts, match\nprimary keys). This can easily take up 100+ lines of SQL and hours of\nunsatisfying work, which no one really wants to do. (3) &quot;Fuck It, Ship\nIt&quot; is always an option but too risky nowadays as analytical data not\nonly powers dashboards but also production ML models.<p>As this problem is common in data engineering, some large\norganizations have built and open-sourced their solutions – for\nexample, BigDiffy by Spotify. However, most of these tools are\nCLI-based and produce results in a plain-text format which is hard to\ncomprehend when you are dealing with complex data.<p>To fit existing workflows of our users, we’ve built a web interface\nwith interactive charts showing both diff summary statistics (e.g. %\nof different values by column) and value-level side-by-side comparison\n(git diff style). But since the mission of the tool is to save\nengineers as much time as possible, we also opened an API for\nautomation through Airflow or other orchestrators, and built a Github\nworkflow that runs diff on every pull request with changes to ETL\ncode. Since billion-row-scale datasets are not uncommon nowadays,\nthere is an optional sampling feature that helps keep compute costs\nlow and get results within a few minutes no matter how large the\ndataset is.<p>We&#x27;ve found Datafold to be a good fit for the following workflows: (1)\nDeveloping data transformations – before an ETL job is shipped to\nproduction, it undergoes multiple iterations. Often it’s important to\nsee how data changes between every iteration, and particularly useful\nif you have 1M+ rows and 100+ columns where “SELECT *” becomes\nuseless. (2) Code review &amp; testing: large organizations have hundreds\nof people committing to ETL codebases. Understanding the impact of\neven a modest SQL diff is daunting. Datafold can produce a data diff\nfor every commit in minutes so changes are well understood. (3) Data\ntransfer validation: moving large volumes of data between databases is\nerror-prone, especially if done via change data capture (CDC): a\nsingle lost event can affect the resulting dataset in a way that is\ntricky to debug. We allow comparing datasets across different\ndatabases, e.g. PostgreSQL &amp; Snowflake.<p>We&#x27;ve set up a sandbox at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.datafold.com&#x2F;hackernews\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.datafold.com&#x2F;hackernews</a> so you can see\nhow diffing works. Shoot us an email (hn@datafold.com) to set up a trial and use it with\nyour own data.<p>We are passionate about improving tooling for data engineers and would\nlove to hear about your experience with developing data pipelines and\nensuring data quality.

background: I am currently working on a startup, and there are 3 of us. We&#x27;re in the UK. We&#x27;ve been at this for about 3 months now.<p>I&#x27;m technical (coding etc), the other two are more business focused. They are planning the product out, I&#x27;m building it for them (it&#x27;s a dashboard basically, showing charts and graphs, fairly standard stuff from my perspective).<p>Division of shares is 20% (me), 40% for each of the other founders (Mr X, and Mr Y).<p>The startup is Mr X&#x27;s idea. He convinced myself and Mr Y to leave our very nice jobs and work on this full time. Mr X told us he would be doing this as well, but he has not. He is heavily involved with a number of other startups (I think 4 others).<p>Myself and Mr Y are banging our heads against the wall. We get Mr X on a call for an hour each day, which he is often late for as his other calls run over. Sometimes he is late to other calls as our call runs over.<p>Things that need to be done by Mr X just aren&#x27;t getting done, it&#x27;s me and Mr Y doing most of the work at the moment.<p>From my perspective, I think the idea is good, the industry is interesting to learn about, and I&#x27;m happy to sit and build out a dashboard, but it won&#x27;t work without Mr X&#x27;s full input. He&#x27;s a very smart guy, and very knowledgable about this industry, but he&#x27;s just not pulling his weight.<p>We are pre funding. Myself and Mr Y are currently relying on our savings, Mr X I think gets income from his other projects. I think we will be able to raise money, Mr X has a good track record in regard to funding.<p>We have tried:<p>* Asking Mr X to give up equity until he is on board full time. He would look into it...<p>* Straight up saying on calls, &quot;we need you to stop working on your other projects and focus on this. we quit our jobs for this&quot;. Lot&#x27;s of &quot;yes that&#x27;s the plan&quot; etc<p>* Threatening to walk away if things don&#x27;t change. Mr X gets very upset, promises to fix things...<p>So, what the hell do we do?

Carefully scaling rollouts to ever larger groups of customers is the safest deployment strategy, but can take weeks. Even for elite DevOps organizations up to 15% of changes to production can result in degraded service [1] [2].<p>We met as undergrads at Georgia Tech and come from a DevOps and operations background so we’ve seen this first hand. Each of us has over 15 years of experience building high-reliability systems, starting in the early days with satellite earth station monitoring. As interns we once wrote a bug that caused a 32 meter antenna to try to point down through the earth, almost flattening the building we were in. It was a great environment to learn about engineering reliability. We leveraged this experience to tackle monitoring Java app servers, SOA, SaaS observability and cloud data warehouses. What if we could use a form of observability data to automatically test the reliability of new deployments before they hit production? That’s the idea that got us started on Speedscale.<p>Most test automation tools record browser interactions or use AI to generate a set of UI tests. Speedscale works differently in that it captures API calls at the source using a Kubernetes sidecar [3] or a reverse proxy. We can see all the traffic going in and out of each service, not just the UI. We feed the traffic through an analyzer process that detects calls to external services and emulates a realistic request and response -- even authentication systems like OAUTH =).  Unlike guessing how users call your service, Speedscale automation reflects reality because we collected data from your live system. We call each interaction model a Scenario and Speedscale generates them without human effort leading to an easily maintained full-coverage CI test suite.<p>Scenarios can run on demand or in your build pipeline because Speedscale inserts your container into an ephemeral environment where we stress it with different performance, regression, and chaos scenarios. If it breaks, you can decide the alerting threshold. Speedscale is especially effective in ensuring compliance with subtle Service Level Objective (SLO) conditions like performance regression [4].<p>We&#x27;re not public yet but would be happy to give you a demo if you contact us at hello@speedscale.com. Also, we are doing alpha customer deployments to refine our feature set and protocol support - if you have this problem or have tried to solve it in the past we would love to get your feedback. Eventually we’ll end up selling the service via a subscription model but the details are still TBD. For the moment we’re mainly focused on making the product more useful and collecting feedback.

Like many of you, I&#x27;m an incredibly curious person and enjoy thinking about things from a critical lens and new points of view.<p>I run a newsletter called Thinking About Things that consists of an email every other day with a link to an article about something interesting, in a myriad of different topics. Its goal is to allow people to think about things in ways they hadn&#x27;t before. You can see the website [0] and a sample of previous articles [1] for more info. I don&#x27;t make any money off of this newsletter - I do it for the thrill of sharing and contributing new ideas with hundreds of other people. They are generally articles by lesser-known bloggers who are very interesting to read.<p>Readers of HN are exactly the target audience of this newsletter, people who care and are excited about new ideas. If you do sign up, I&#x27;d very much love to hear comments and feedback - you can reach me by replying to the emails.<p>If this sounds like something you&#x27;d enjoy, you can sign up here [2].

PERSONAL OPINION COMING THROUGH!!!!<p>... Single inheritance<p>Imagine you are hired in a company but they have this rule that nobody can walk more than 3 steps in one direction so you have to rotate 90 degrees, also you can&#x27;t cross the path you have travelled already. Now everyone comes up with contrived and ridiculous strategies to get to the restroom, cafetaria, and kitchen. That&#x27;s what design patterns are, at least lot of them.<p>They are simply strategies to mitigate the limitations of Static typing. For example Factory Pattern, Facade, Decorator, Adapter, ...<p>Now definitely not the case for ALL design patterns but I do think many are. It&#x27;s kinda sad when you entire program is simply a fight against types.<p>Coming from Ruby and Javascript land this seems very stupid.<p>I don&#x27;t need to make 10 abstract classes, 10 interfaces and overload, underload, sideload (lol) same functions.<p>The main pain point seem to be you have only one chain of inheritance.<p>What we do these days for JS seems to be the simplest solution. Import whatever functionality you need, run the function, and be done with it. No point in defining entire world in terms of single inheritance. Simply compose what you need.<p>It&#x27;s my opinion OOP with Static typing results in very contrived code that is half solving the technical problem and half fighting its limitations. Oh but that autocomplete.<p>I used typescript. I didn&#x27;t care much for abstract blabalba. But I really liked being able to define input and output in strict terms.

today updated the iMac (Pro).

Thus, I will give describe my situation. The company I work for gave me a 13&quot; MBP that has deceng juice to get my work done (mainly writing docx and LaTeX, using SSH for remote access to Linux servers and workstations). And I am also alowed to use it for private purposes, so I also use it for my side-projects (Python and Xcode projects mainly). Now comes the catch. I&#x27;m also musician using Logic. And here the MBP struggles having only 4 Cores. So, my plan was to buy an decent iMac and use it for the next 6+ years. I wanted to buy the i9 CPU and 512GB SSD and upgrade the RAM myself. And after all the years, the iMac would be upgradable (to some degree). But these options are now gone, I think. macOS will certainly not be supported for 6+ years (assuming a similar timeline as during the last transition). So if I buy one now, in the near future I will have a really expensive Linux worstation.<p>And there is also the question if (i)Macs with Apple Silicon will be upgradeable. CPUs surely not, but I am afraid RAM and storage won&#x27;t be upgradable neither.<p>So, what is you take on this problem? Would you buy or not?

I was playing around with some video conferencing software and was very impressed by how far it had come in recent years. With not much else to do, I started brainstorming about what could one day be possible with better conferencing technology.<p>An obvious use case seemed be education. I thought perhaps the best teacher for any niche topic might not actually be someone in the same city or state as you, but, instead, could be someone across the globe. Better video conferencing could lead to more accessible as well as more affordable education.<p>The thought was powerful enough that I decided to quit my job at Facebook to start working on Virtually the next month. My main mission was to enable infrastructure for live online education. The very first iteration of the product allowed for content creators to monetize their time by selling 1-on-1 appointments. I don&#x27;t know if it was the product or the execution, but it didn&#x27;t gain much traction. I was lucky to be invited to interview at YCombinator for the summer 2019 batch but didn&#x27;t make it further in the process.<p>I started to explore other applications of the same technology. One place where it seemed a live component could have added more value was in the world of online courses. In 2019, almost all online courses were pre-recorded. There were a select few experimenting with the live format (Building a Second Brain for example) and it seemed like these courses were receiving significantly higher levels of engagement than traditional online courses. When I dug a bit deeper, I discovered that building live online courses was inherently difficult. Either you were a venture-backed startup and could afford to hire engineers to build out custom technology or you had to &quot;duct-tape&quot; Zoom, PayPal, Calendly, and a dozen different tools together. I pivoted the product to help make this easier.<p>Fast-forward to today- my team and I are working to build Virtually, a React web app (powered by Next.js) that allows individual to build live online courses with built-in support for conferencing, payment processing, and student management.<p>Current course hosting platforms (Teachable, Kajabi, Thinktific, etc.) primarily focus on pre-recorded content. We decided to focus on live online classes as our research showed that live classes generally have higher completion rates. In addition, we hypothesized that live learning would help drive higher content retention through virtual meet-ups, office hours, mastermind groups, etc.<p>We primarily use <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;daily.co&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;daily.co&#x2F;</a> for video conferencing but allow users to substitute Zoom or any other conferencing link. We also integrate with Google Calendar to make it easier to schedule live sessions.<p>One notable feature is our &quot;Live Room&quot; which is an always-on conferencing room that is embedded within your Virtually classroom.  With the tool, you&#x27;re able to manage multiple concurrent live classes at the same the same time each with its own &quot;Live Room.&quot;<p>If you or someone you know is trying to build a live online training program, we&#x27;d love to talk to you.

However, I feel lost about what I want to do with my life. I used to be passionate about CS but lost it after high school, but chose to keep going with it because it is lucrative and I am good at it. I interned in software development last summer and my experience confirmed my suspicion that I dislike CS and would find it really unpleasant to work a 9 to 5 job where my main task is programming.<p>I have resented CS and saw it as something I just had to do, and so have not done any research in college. I really only have 1 internship under my belt, but did not feel like I made a huge contribution where I was. My true passion languages, specifically Chinese (high level) and Japanese (basic conversations), and I want to try living in Japan (I am from the US).<p>I love languages, so I have considered studying NLP or machine translation, but honestly am not sure if that will lead to a job I still dislike given I do not like CS. I am looking into applying to grad school to have a competitive edge in a specialized CS field. The applications are this fall, and I feel like I do not have much to on my resume other than 1 internship, good grades, and a good GRE score.<p>I was thinking about applying to work at a company in Japan, like Microsoft Japan, etc. and work there for 1 or 2 years to get the experience of living there while doing things I could put on a resume to grad school, and find something I am interested in along the way. I do not know what my chances are of getting such a job there is, especially now with COVID.<p>My question is how should I go about finding a career path I will enjoy but also provide for me? Am I rushing into grad school? Should I work in Japan for 1 or 2 years (my favorite option), should I work for a company in the US, or should I do post-bach research?<p>Is anything I am saying even worth trying, or am I on the completely wrong path?<p>Thank you so much!","time":1596497740,"title":"Ask HN: How do I find a career path?","type":"story"},{"by":"arsenkay","descendants":4,"id":24044725,"kids":[24044853,24045470],"score":4,"time":1596497414,"title":"6 Reasons Why You Should Stop Using Google Analytics on Your Web Site Now","type":"story","url":"https://privateanalytix.com/2020/08/03/6-reasons-why-you-should-stop-using-google-analytics-on-your-web-site-now/"},{"by":"tropheusduboisi","descendants":14,"id":24044626,"kids":[24045266,24045713,24044884],"score":22,"time":1596496606,"title":"UC Berkeley boosts Latino admissions by 40% in one year","type":"story","url":"https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/07/16/uc-berkeleys-push-for-more-diversity-shows-in-its-newly-admitted-class/"},{"by":"dougdonohoe","descendants":4,"id":24044584,"kids":[24045032,24046079],"score":17,"time":1596496297,"title":"New York Times ordered 59M publishing assets on a laptop using Go","type":"story","url":"https://open.nytimes.com/publishing-assets-we-had-a-few-c3a844e98bac"},{"by":"cjdrake","descendants":2,"id":24044569,"kids":[24046122,24046194,24046232],"score":40,"time":1596496170,"title":"My Life Pouring Concrete","type":"story","url":"https://quillette.com/2020/08/02/my-life-pouring-concrete/"},{"by":"simonebrunozzi","descendants":386,"id":24044409,"kids":[24044758,24044820,24044797,24044921,24044805,24044825,24045585,24044952,24044799,24044736,24044733,24044838,24044765,24044741,24045708,24044767,24045056,24044893,24045435,24048206,24078530,24044811,24045325,24046675,24045714,24047208,24051474,24046989,24045558,24045567,24045079,24044988,24045695,24046054,24044718,24044831,24045780,24044751,24045502,24045958,24044729,24044823,24044779,24046343,24044869,24045539,24045312,24045392,24044631,24045624,24045237,24045451,24045136],"score":405,"time":1596495009,"title":"Physical attractiveness bias in the legal system (2017)","type":"story","url":"https://www.thelawproject.com.au/insights/attractiveness-bias-in-the-legal-system"},{"by":"korono","descendants":2,"id":24044307,"kids":[24044308,24045208],"score":11,"time":1596494230,"title":"Introudction to Ansible Playbooks","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@michaeljonaitis/an-introduction-to-ansible-playbooks-dfbc0f3ad71b"},{"by":"aaron695","descendants":2,"id":24044347,"kids":[24044985,24045171],"score":9,"time":1596494524,"title":"The Air Force’s Latest GPS Alternative: Earth’s Magnetic Fields","type":"story","url":"https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2020/07/air-forces-latest-gps-alternative-earths-magnetic-fields/167387/"},{"by":"pseudolus","descendants":8,"id":24044165,"kids":[24044528,24046425],"score":12,"time":1596493312,"title":"Painkillers such as aspirin 'do more harm than good' for chronic pain","type":"story","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/aug/03/painkillers-such-as-aspirin-do-more-harm-than-good-for-chronic-pain"},{"by":"mrzool","descendants":16,"id":24044162,"kids":[24047505,24046408,24048170,24048189,24079841,24046381,24046840],"score":44,"time":1596493280,"title":"Baby boomers show concerning decline in cognitive functioning","type":"story","url":"https://news.osu.edu/baby-boomers-show-concerning-decline-in-cognitive-functioning/"},{"by":"luu","descendants":7,"id":24044188,"kids":[24057899,24056103,24056457,24057239,24057067],"score":21,"time":1596493483,"title":"Best lenses for sunstars","type":"story","url":"https://phillipreeve.net/blog/best-lenses-for-sunstars/"},{"by":"quickthrower2","descendants":5,"id":24044128,"kids":[24050181,24048937,24048974],"score":19,"time":1596493069,"title":"Browse the Web with Your Voice","type":"story","url":"https://voice.mozilla.org/firefox-voice/"},{"by":"JeremyMorgan","descendants":88,"id":24044043,"kids":[24047531,24049160,24045463,24046388,24047000,24045702,24049218,24046898,24069656,24047401,24045627,24048997],"score":96,"time":1596492513,"title":"Go vs. Rust: Writing a CLI Tool","type":"story","url":"https://cuchi.me/posts/go-vs-rust"},{"by":"pinkrobotics","descendants":14,"id":24044039,"kids":[24044239,24050070,24047713,24069822,24047911,24044471,24044066],"score":10,"text":"Howdy HN,<p>My name is Tyler, I&#x27;m a robotics entrepreneur and I just started a Kickstarter that is going to fail (see www.PinkRobotics.ca). I won&#x27;t blame it, anyone else or even myself for it failing. Could I do a lot better? Obviously. Will it make the difference? Probably not. Nevertheless, I still think the world needs my campaign to succeed; but there is also little I can do to make that happen.<p>So, I seek the often sound and level headed advice of HK et al.:<p>My story:\nI have a BSc in CS, where I focused on AI stuff, and an MSc where I published about applying AI stuff to HPC stuff. I went to a space university program and learned about space stuff. Then, I did seven years of a PhD where I tried to be ambitious but it didn&#x27;t work out, so I quietly left without succeeding anymore. Then I did a year long solo motorcycle trip around Mexico, starting and ending in Canada. After, I started a robotics company to address climate change with technological solutions. I applied to YC and UBC startup programs to use large drones and other robots to help fight the locally pressing issue of wildfires. Neither organization was interested, for several understandable reasons including: I am alone, no likelihood of a short term high yield return and the societal benefit of my project wasn&#x27;t considered. So, I &quot;gave up&quot; and applied to a dozen jobs in my area. Only to not receive any replies at all, from anyone, not even rejections. Likely a blessing though, as I have no faith in my ability to pass a technical interview at this point in my &quot;career&quot;. So I worked for a friend doing tradeswork to the pay the bills, until covid hit and I went on gov&#x27;t support.

Strings is a tool for writers and product teams to search and edit your app’s copy without learning how to code. Developers save time not having to edit copy while retaining control over their code. When writers edit copy, Strings automatically generates a pull request for engineering approval in Git.<p>While working at our prior companies, we always felt it was painful to get a simple copy change done:\n- A task is created in eg Jira.\n- A PM then looks at the tasks and prioritizes it.\n- An engineering lead looks at it and estimates it.\n- At last, the sprint starts and an engineer picks up the task for the copy edit. She looks at the edit request and maybe jumps into the design tool to look at the screen in question. Then she goes to find the right string file in the right repo and find the correct copy string to edit, copying or retyping the updated content.<p>A copy change ends up involving many people, handovers, context switches, processes and may take weeks to get to your users. It creates so much organizational waste and friction that many copy improvements die a slow death. Content bugs and typos live on, inconsistency hurts the brand and the user experience suffers as a result.<p>Having developers changing copy is a terrible use of engineering time.<p>It’s busy work and requires context switches that distracts from harder problems. Strings sits on top of your code repository allowing writers, designers and product managers to browse and edit in-app copy. Its purpose is to remove the friction and handover steps required to edit copy in a controlled environment where developers retain the final approval.<p>Strings only take a few minutes to set up<p>Strings doesn’t require any complicated implementation. Developers install the Strings GitHub app and link their string files.

We let anyone create custom software powered by data from Airtable or Google Sheets, with a nice UI, auth and rich permissions. Think Internal Tools, Custom CRMs, and Customer Portals.<p>We&#x27;ve been working for ages on building something that lets non-technical people create software without code. We spent about 2 years building a really powerful and complicated drag-and-drop no-code app builder. It was really awesome, it could create social networks, SaaS, marketplaces – the works. The only problem was: nobody could use it unless they were already a developer! It turned out that even though you weren&#x27;t technically writing any code… you were still actually programming, still thinking like a developer. Just with a really inefficient set of no-code tools.<p>We (eventually!) realised that non-devs were already building systems anyway; but instead of code they were using spreadsheets.<p>Spreadsheets are basically the world&#x27;s most used database&#x2F;IDE. They&#x27;re great for modelling and managing data. But, if you&#x27;ve ever used someone else&#x27;s sheet you&#x27;ll know that they&#x27;re not the best way to interact with the data. Giving someone access to your spreadsheet is pretty much like giving someone access to your SQL database – they won&#x27;t understand it, they might see more than they should, and they might break the whole thing.<p>Stacker is basically an app layer on top of spreadsheet. We let you set up a nice UI, add user login, and limit who can see&#x2F;do what using permissions. We also handle abstracting away the limitations of the APIs of Airtable&#x2F;Google Sheets so that the whole thing stays performant.<p>The main two cases where people find Stacker useful are:<p>1. they want to create internal tools that are easier to use&#x2F;understand<p>2. they want to allow customers&#x2F;partners access to some of the data in their sheet without giving the whole thing<p>We&#x27;ve been really excited that most of our early users have been non-technical people who hadn&#x27;t ever thought they could create software for their business. People have been creating marketplaces, CRMs, resources centres, order-tracking portals, ERPs… lots of stuff. We&#x27;re a monthly SaaS model starting at $39pcm – we handle all the hosting, infrastructure, and even SSL certs etc.<p>Right now we support Airtable and Google Sheets, but we&#x27;d like to expand out to include other data sources like SQL databases, APIs and even MS Excel(!).<p>Underneath the hood we&#x27;ve got a bunch of technology from our original web app builder – a python backend that creates on-the-fly endpoints depending on the user&#x27;s data model, and react frontend that can flexibly layout the app. Then on top of that, we&#x27;ve got a service that analyses the schema from your sheet and automatically creates your initial Stacker app.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear what use cases you can think of for this, either internal or external, and what you&#x27;d like to see it do in the future!

We are planning on hiring a developer to build the webapp but personally I would have qualms with not having strong knowledge of both the webapp stack as well as the deployment, so I am currently on planning on learning some basic devops so I can oversee deployments and infrastructure as we slowly scale.<p>I have a few questions that I would really appreciate anyone&#x27;s insight into:<p>(a) Would it be a mistake to outsource the development of our webapp for a long period of time (say, ~6 months) without anyone on our team acting in a CTO role? I will be continuing to develop the backend core of our product in Python, but I know nothing about web development and have no desire to learn.<p>(b) Can anyone recommend good resources for someone looking to handle the devops of their product? Is this too ambitious of a task for someone with no experience in such things?
