And, usually, has done it quite well.<p>This happened to me while starting on Bike Gear Database - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bikegeardatabase.com (aka BGDB). I convinced myself I had stumbled onto a unique value prop for the bike industry. I started building out the stack and MVP like a madman. About a month in, a friend told me about the wonderful site called 99spokes which was everything that I had in my head for BGDB, and more.<p>At work, I was learning how to assess the value of websites using various SEO tools. A search at Ahrefs showed me that 99spokes had ranked for almost 75,000 keywords and were generating about 64k organic visitors a month.<p>I was crushed. How do you compete against that sort of traction? I ended up stopping work on BGDB because of it.\nA month or so later, I met a new friend named Alex, that had raised two companies from zero to acquisition. He understood BGDBs value. When I showed him 99spokes in Ahrefs he said, &quot;this is a very good thing&quot;.<p>The moment he said it, my entire mind clicked! Of course, it was a good thing! This meant that the idea was validated and there was a business in it. Also, there was only one other company working on the problem. This got me very excited and I got back to work. I am super thankful for Alex helping me see that.\nNow the question is - how do I scale to compete? Is there a possibility for us to even work together? Etc etc. Momentum is picking up and I am having a ton of fun making BGDB.<p>How about you? Have you ever let discovering a competitor stop you?

Just anywhere where I can more or less walk and look without anything requiring my attention.<p>- Doing sports feels very good afterwards, sometimes for days if the activity was intense enough. Running or walking might be the easiest thing to start, the latter does not even require comfortable clothes. Just go out and walk. Bodyweight exercises can also be intense and do not necessarily require any weights or machines. There are exercises that require no more than a yoga mat or a carpet to train on. Cheap and effective, imo. Check the web for details.<p>- Sauna (if you have access to one)<p>- Spending time for oneself if domestic bliss is lacking (running or walking is great as does not require one to justify why one would like to be for oneself).<p>- (Offline) reading is great, it really helps me focus on something and to silence other thoughts. This doesn&#x27;t work with every book for me and I usually need to read into a few to find a good one.<p>- Anything that makes you feel in control to boost your (perceived) self-efficacy.

Whether it’s embedded telemetry inside applications or the OS, to not being able to launch an app on MacOS if Apple’s servers are having problems. Facebook’s SDK can kill entire applications, demonstrating they possess a “kill switch” and your every mouse click, button press, typed word is being logged somewhere (and, most likely, uploaded to a server).<p>Previously, this would have been called ‘spyware’, these days, it’s just common practice. Every website includes some tracker, or requests to several third parties, and if you want to try and be a bit anonymous then the web breaks as you disable JS or block cookies. Essentially, the deal is, you give us data and we will invite you to the party.<p>And, on other platforms, you have no insight into <i>what</i> your device is doing, whom it’s communicating with, and <i>what</i> is being said. Your phone or computer is constantly having conversations you can’t hear; they use the same technologies we rely on for security (TLS) which ensures we are unable to understand and control data flowing in and out of our devices. Exactly as designed.<p>Communities like Hackernews and Reddit are constantly promoting such discussions and many debates are had as words are exchanged, only for those same words to be monetized and used in ever more sophisticated systems that are causing real human suffering across the world. Data can be used in many ways, and, it seems recently, the focus has been on how algorithms are targeted towards people, and the influences they have (consider the recent US election, and the content algorithms promote based on their “interests”, or how content can be targeted towards &#x27;depressed&#x27; individuals).<p>Social platforms now control conversation, as they (thanks to the recent administration) are engaged in a battle for what is and isn’t acceptable speech. Youtube has to decide what content stays and goes, and the EU wants to push for content to be removed within an hour; new systems are made to achieve that goal whilst collateral damage is caused by overly cautious and erroneous bots that try to make the decision automatically. Your thought provoking video is no longer welcome and &#x27;you&#x27; are cancelled as the horde of angry internet bees are destined to ensure you never so much as think of posting another video again. A few suicides later and the buzz of the media&#x27;s intense focus casts the disarray into the spotlight, your mind has already been set, you want no part in the play.<p>As a human, using a computer, you’re being watched. If you say something offensive, or that the state dislikes, you will be discovered and actions taken accordingly. Your web history is stored, your friends and social graph is mapped and ranked according to the people closest to you.<p>And all of this for…What? Clearly there is an element of control and power, an ability to carefully monitor trends and whether there is growing discord. Real world policy decisions are driven by analytics and data, such as whether certain courses of action are popular and reactions to them (especially during Coronavirus).<p>I recently purchased an upgraded desktop, now I am wondering what for. Most people’s exposure of the “internet” is social platforms, and if they visit “websites” it’s only via a search; even Google wants to discourage further discovery as they try to answer your queries within the page itself.<p>Sadly, I don’t see a continuing need to have more powerful processor when there is so little to explore; anything that might be interesting or useful is probably taken down by the DMCA or censored as someone, somewhere, dislikes whatever you’ve made and asserts their authority to expunge it from humanity.<p>And what are we left with? Can’t even use an application to archive youtube content because, yet again, someone dislikes that concept.<p>Computers are not ours, the Internet is just for logging humanities affairs and computers are more hostile today than at any other point in history.<p>Am I wrong?","time":1605357375,"title":"Ask HN: Are computers

Or is spoken language just too complicated for us to understand in fully?","time":1605326896,"title":"Ask HN: What is the most Pythonic spoken language?","type":"story"},{"by":"fkramink","descendants":5,"id":25090215,"kids":[25090622,25090517],"score":21,"time":1605326813,"title":"A GAN to generate dithers minimising frame difference for a slow movie player","type":"story","url":"http://matpalm.com/blog/dithernet_vsmp/"},{"by":"simonw","descendants":57,"id":25090218,"kids":[25090446,25090222,25090986,25093146,25090888,25095367,25090675,25091675,25092323,25090762,25090607,25090476,25092547,25090848,25101972,25091364,25090839,25090731,25090464,25093275,25090740],"score":419,"time":1605326835,"title":"Personal Data Warehouses: Reclaiming Your Data","type":"story","url":"https://simonwillison.net/2020/Nov/14/personal-data-warehouses/"},{"by":"simonpure","descendants":39,"id":25090176,"kids":[25090424,25090513,25091551,25093864,25093221,25093162,25092666,25092281,25090988,25090709,25091335,25091184],"score":199,"time":1605326336,"title":"Logseq – privacy-first, open-source knowledge sharing and management platform","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/logseq/logseq"},{"by":"desertraven","descendants":7,"id":25090146,"kids":[25090281,25090193,25090293],"score":2,"text":"By qualified I mean you don’t currently have the skills needed, but think you can develop them in tandem with the project.","time":1605325786,"title":"Ask HN: Do you ever take on projects you’re not qualified for?","type":"story"},{"by":"gilad","descendants":3,"id":25090112,"kids":[25090238,25095766],"score":27,"time":1605325022,"title":"A Visual Guide to Regular Expression","type":"story","url":"https://amitness.com/regex/"},{"by":"johntfella","descendants":1,"id":25090089,"kids":[25090090,25090098],"score":6,"time":1605324687,"title":"Michaeljburry Twitter thread on the need for raw election data","type":"story","url":"https://twitter.com/michaeljburry/status/1327343055192559616"},{"by":"renwoshin","descendants":6,"id":25089943,"kids":[25090524,25090507,25093243],"score":17,"time":1605322976,"title":"Show HN: Write a software patent in under 20 hours with no experience","type":"story","url":"https://zerotopatent.teachable.com/p/how-to-write-a-software-patent-in-under-20-hours-with-0-experience"},{"by":"snvzz","descendants":5,"id":25089996,"kids":[25090206,25090708,25090181],"score":19,"time":1605323569,"title":"Macs Are a Privacy Nightmare","type":"story","url":"https://www.osnews.com/story/132577/macs-are-a-privacy-nightmare/"},{"by":"pier25","descendants":69,"id":25089933,"kids":[25091096,25090163,25090237,25093723,25090333,25091103,25090850,25090235,25091018,25090267,25090159,25090414,25091026],"score":123,"time":1605322850,"title":"macOS 11 (Big Sur) Compatibility News","type":"story","url":"https://support.native-instruments.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013515618-macOS-11-Big-Sur-Compatibility-News"},{"by":"sean_pedersen","descendants":6,"id":25089693,"kids":[25089932,25089778,25089696],"score":1,"text":"Nuclear power has many advantages but the few disadvantages are severe. One of the major ones is leftover nuclear waste of nuclear power plants. It is highly toxic and stays radioactive for thousands of years, leaving a pandora box of nuclear death for future humans to deal with. We urgently need to clean up after our nuclear shit trail.<p>Currently we bury it somewhere and hope it will not escape any time soon. This is rather naive. Give it enough time and it will leak into our environment. So how can we improve? Shooting the nuclear waste straight into space is a compelling option, either on a stable orbit leaving our solar system or directly into the sun.<p>Current rocket technology is not gonna do it. So let’s try something else: Make a big bullet containing our nuclear waste. Accompanied with a giant cannon that is fueled by water steam produced by nuclear power. Build up high enough pressure to accelerate the bullet to earth&#x27;s escape velocity.<p>How to build the capable cannon? Dig a cylindrical hole down into earth, add a sufficient amount of pressure chambers along the cannon barrel. The shooting mechanism: Release pressure of the chambers from the bottom to the top sequentially, accelerating the waste bullet to the needed escape velocity. Before all that, calculate where to dig the hole according to the needed trajectory. There it is: A nuclear powered nuclear waste dispensing cannon.<p>Biggest potential hurdle: This nuclear waste dispenser design only works out if it can dispense more waste than is produced in order to operate it. Figuring that out is key to success and is left as an exercise for the curious reader.<p>Biggest potential failure: The nuclear waste bullet does not reach escape velocity and comes right back at spaceship earth. Mitigation: Simulate several failures without real nuclear waste but the same bullet case design and a realistic non-toxic replacement material for the waste.","time":1605319653,"title":"A Nuclear Powered Nuclear Waste Dispenser","type":"story"},{"by":"jonathancai11","descendants":3,"id":25089681,"kids":[25089875,25089899,25089765],"score":3,"text":"Recently took Monica Lent&#x27;s Blogging for Devs 7 day email course.\n(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bloggingfordevs.com&#x2F;)<p>Thought the content was great but the delivery format (straight to email inbox) made it extremely effective.<p>It made me wonder, why aren&#x27;t there more email courses out there?<p>It seems like many e-books and online courses would be far more engaging&#x2F;effective&#x2F;valuable as email courses.","time":1605319478,"title":"Ask HN: Thoughts on Email Courses?","type":"story"},{"by":"SkinTaco","dead":true,"id":25089626,"kids":[25089973,25090656,25089751,25090527,25090346],"score":4,"text":"TikTok&#x27;s package is com.zhiliaoapp.musically.

One is to use things like printf or kprintf, to print the current state of a program.<p>The other is to use some of the many debuggers that are around, and inspect the state of the running program, along the call stack.<p>I think this is, to some degree, probably often a kind of personality-related preference. Personally, I like to use  printf, because it matches well with what I call &quot;the scientific method of debugging&quot;:<p>1. I have an idea what a program should do<p>2. I observe something that is different - that is, my mental model of what the program does diverges at some point from reality<p>3. I try to make a more refined mental model of what <i>might</i> be happening<p>4. I test that mental model by inserting print commands at very specific points in the code<p>5. I observe what happens. based on that, I possibly modify the code, and go back to number 2.<p>For me, this has turned out to work surprisingly well in a number of domain, such as concurrent real-time systems, complex signal processing, and more. (The nice thing abpout printf in concurrent systems is that it serializes events, which helps).<p>Other people, I see, prefer to use a debugger. My hypothesis is now that this is due to a combination of both personality as well as concrete tasks where a debugger might be suited better.<p>So, what I am interested in is your observations of specific cases and circumstances when one methodology might work better than the other.

I suspect this will convey and reinforce a good tone for our culture.<p>I said that some companies, like a certain FAANG, do the coding tests for <i>everyone</i>, perhaps partly because they&#x27;re huge enough to want objective metrics and standardization, and maybe in some cases also as an institutionalized power move.  And they <i>can</i> do it, because they&#x27;re otherwise attractive enough to many candidates, and can also afford to alienate some candidates.<p>Early startups are different: There&#x27;s an opportunity to get a feel for each candidate, and to discuss among the team.  And that we should be able to get a sufficient qualitative feel isn&#x27;t unreasonable: it&#x27;s just as fair for the candidate to wonder how competent the team they&#x27;re considering joining, yet we don&#x27;t let the candidate give us coding tests.

launched the MVP of my startup today after two weeks of non-stop work.<p>Right now, Disco is an artist discovery platform where artists can submit their Spotify tracks for users to listen to through a Tinder-like UI, swiping right on the ones they like.<p>The vision is far grander, of course, and involves fostering greater artist &lt;-&gt; fan connection while also providing a sustainable source of revenue for artists.<p>The music industry in its current state is too impersonal and not sustainable for all but the biggest artists. The solution to both problems is artist &lt;-&gt; fan connection&#x2F;engagement, where an artist&#x27;s fans can interact directly with the artist and actually connect with them rather than cheer them on from far away. I believe loyal fans will be willing to financially support their favorite artists in exchange for that level of connection.<p>Disco is aiming to build the platform to enable that. I focused the MVP on discovery in order to focus on artists who are just starting their career. I&#x27;m excited to conduct lots of interviews to really understand the problems they face.<p>More info on the future of Disco is here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;info.disco.so<p>The actual app is here:

My margin has roughly been 40-50% on each project so far.<p>Those of you who&#x27;ve been in this business for 2+ years now, I&#x27;m curious how it&#x27;s worked for you and what advice you would have for yourself starting out or for me. My goal is to build a healthy income (200k+) for myself. I&#x27;m not looking to build a $multi-million consulting practice but it&#x27;d be great to get to a million or high six-figures in billings.<p>How did you grow from a few one-off clients to a healthy pipeline of new business? How does one outgrow this phase where business only comes from your network?<p>How long did it take you to cross $1M in billings&#x2F;yr?<p>What&#x27;s the typical client you work with? early stage? mid-sized&#x2F;large companies? founders? are you focused on a niche?<p>I understand what I&#x27;m offering is a commodity service but I try to focus on my USP of <i>bay-area based strong technical leader&#x2F;fmr founder who you can trust with owning product development</i>. This doesn&#x27;t scale though - I can&#x27;t be doing 8 projects. The easier path to the money I want to make would be to just freelance at a high rate but I am looking to grow this as a business, not as a solo practice.<p>Can you share your learnings?","time":1605029755,"title":"Ask HN: Do you run a dev shop/consultancy?

At the same time, there&#x27;s an assumption (that I agree with) that personal attention from a good teacher is a major contributor to the education of a typical student. So What if we removed that constraint?<p>Let&#x27;s then assume that we had unlimited funds, and could hire the best possible educational expert on a subject, perhaps the one who is best suited to write the textbook and lesson plans, to instead teach a single student directly, without any time or resource limits. What would the ideal course of study look like then?<p>Expanding upon this, here&#x27;s my proposed research question: &quot;If a curious, capable and motivated student has unlimited access to a kind, knowledgeable and motivated teacher, how should the relationship between the be structured to optimize the educational benefit?&quot;.<p>In particular, I&#x27;m interested in time allocation - how much time should the student spend studying per day? How much of that time should be spent with the teacher, how much on their own, how much with peers (with or without the teacher)? How much of the time with the teacher should be spent on the student listening to &#x2F; watching the instructor, how much of that should be spent on the student asking questions, how much on the instructor watching the student tackle tasks and providing limited guidance?

I first spent a lot of time digging through stuff to figure out what I should do (pull request? submit an issue? something else?). A pull request seemed to be the right answer, but I was hesitant to do that for various reasons -- partly because in my mind that&#x27;s for updating <i>code</i> -- and when I have asked around, no one has ever told me &quot;Oh, you can get involved as a non-coder by submitting a pull request to correct a typo.&quot;<p>When non-coders say things like &quot;Who do I talk with?&quot; or talk about cultural barriers, people try to be nice and assure us &quot;We aren&#x27;t all hateful to non-coders. Come join our email list for this thing!&quot; And it&#x27;s the wrong answer.<p>The correct answer is &quot;None of that matters. You can submit a pull request if you find a typo or other small issue and that&#x27;s the best way for a non-coder to get involved. It&#x27;s small. There&#x27;s no one to talk to. There&#x27;s no email list to join. Just submit the pull request. They will either approve it and merge it with the master or they won&#x27;t and no one will bite your head off about it.

In emacs, I wrote a keyboard macro to update the 10s column (i.e. 10 0s, then 10 1s, up to 10 9s) because who needs to type 100 numbers and 200 arrow keys?<p>In Linux this keyboard macro updates 100 lines and runs as fast as a single keystroke.<p>In WSL it takes MINUTES to run. And when it completes, the next keystroke takes minutes. In frustration I started doing the same task by hand. It worked fine until I had about 1000 lines at which point I could watch the screen updates lag so badly I had to wait for the machine. The performance continued to degrade. Apparently they are updating the whole files worth of screen on every keystroke. At 2000 lines I could go for coffee while it updated my last 10 keystrokes.<p>Normally I would consider this a bug.

Because of that, much of what I do feels empty and does not give me pleasure.<p>I&#x27;m 26 and I&#x27;m finishing my Master&#x27;s Degree, researching NLP, but it feels like there are not many jobs which I could work as a researcher where I live. I also don&#x27;t feel prepared to move to another country to join a big company (I want to work at MS someday lol).<p>All of that makes me feel like what I am doing is for nothing and that it has no meaning.

been on the market for a new job since April following a Covid-19 layoff, and I’m really struggling to deal with the way things are right now. I&#x27;m a non-traditional developer who just reached the low end of mid-level and I just can’t seem to “win”.<p>I’ll get an interview with a company that seems to have a relatively simple product and reportedly “easy” interview process according to Glassdoor, and I’ll get slammed with difficult leetcode questions that don’t seem to get any easier the more I read and practice. Other times, I’ll somehow get an interview with a company that has a complicated product, so I’ll be researching the technology they use and trying to prepare myself for whatever leetcode humiliation I have to suffer, only to drop the ball on a really easy non-leetcode problem. I just came off of this for a contract position that was really exciting but I messed up the absolute easiest rule about interfaces while looking for compiler errors that cost me.<p>Still other companies have HackerRank knockoffs like CodeSignal that don’t support relatively recent versions of languages, making trivial tasks like database access or HTTP GET requests either unnecessarily complex or completely impossible in an interview scenario. Normal code that I&#x27;ve implemented, seen on the job, or otherwise seen on the internet just doesn&#x27;t work for these platforms.<p>I get ghosted a lot after the HR stage seems to go well. A decently-known US company went so far as to reach out to me on StackOverflow, connect me with a recruiter, set up a date for <i>just</i> a chat, and then suddenly fill the position and end the conversation.<p>How does anyone without a network of people they can ask for jobs deal with this? I don&#x27;t think I can take much more of this, nothing so far seems to help. Whenever I try to ask questions or get advice I just get college students and new grads giving me &quot;good vibes&quot; or inapplicable advice they peeled off of CSCQ&#x2F;dev.to and it&#x27;s driving me nuts.","time":1604602777,"title":"Ask HN: How do you stay sane during a floundering job search?","type":"story"},{"by":"knidarkness","descendants":3,"id":25000838,"kids":[25001241,25001110],"score":4,"text":"It&#x27;s almost Friday evening and I was thinking a bit. Now we are approaching the space exploration era (hopefully) again. With SpaceX ambitious plans for reaching Mars as soon as 2024 (even lets say 2028 with all the delays) a new challenge will come.<p>Radio signals take about 3-5 seconds for a round trip between Earth and Moon. Much less for ISS. But with Mars it will be a matter of 6-44 minutes with a fairly &quot;bad signal&quot;. And communications with other human beings (and of course getting access to the vast amount of knowledge) is fairly crucial for a modern human.<p>So, what do you think will be a future of a &quot;long-delay&quot; communications? &quot;Old-school&quot; minimal bandwidth protocols? Using a pre-compiled local knowledge bases? Data compressing algorithms with huge dictionaries? Hope for entangled particles use for communication?<p>And how it can change our experience of communications as well?","time":1604602520,"title":"Ask HN: What is the interplanetary communication future?","type":"story"},{"by":"martinskou","descendants":2,"id":25000680,"kids":[25000810,25000681],"score":3,"time":1604601473,"title":"A $5 Programmable Tiny Webserver the Size of a Jump Drive","type":"story","url":"https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5284328/A-5-Programmable-Webserver-The-Size-of-a-Jump-Driv"},{"by":"jbegley","descendants":349,"id":25000559,"kids":[25000860,25000660,25000707,25000080,25000277,25000931,25005853,25000686,25001988,25000619,25003978,25000113,25000809,25001425,25001404,25001106,25000743,25000970,25000623,25003177,25003646,25000650,25024477,25002293,25000649,25000925,25000848],"score":347,"time":1604600527,"title":"U.S. Feds Seized Nearly $1B in Bitcoin from Wallet Linked to Silk Road","type":"story","url":"https://www.vice.com/en/article/akdgz8/us-feds-seize-1-billion-in-bitcoin-from-wallet-linked-to-silk-road"},{"by":"avastel","descendants":119,"id":25000514,"kids":[25003416,25000780,25001161,25001233,25001712,25004085,25000803,25001262,25002649,25003770,25000644,25006052,25000778,25000814],"score":285,"time":1604600142,"title":"Facebook was used as a proxy by web scraping bots","type":"story","url":"https://datadome.co/bot-detection/how-facebook-was-used-as-a-proxy-by-web-scraping-bots/"},{"by":"johnnyballgame","descendants":2,"id":25000445,"kids":[25000671,25000460],"score":2,"time":1604599613,"title":"How is Visual Basic still ranked #6 programming language in 2020?","type":"story","url":"https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/"},{"by":"MrBuddyCasino","dead":true,"id":25000254,"kids":[25000431,25000520],"score":4,"time":1604598516,"title":"Confessions of a voter fraud: I was a master at fixing mail-in ballots","type":"story","url":"https://nypost.com/2020/08/29/political-insider-explains-voter-fraud-with-mail-in-ballots/"},{"by":"joeyespo","descendants":18,"id":25000279,"kids":[25005014,25004058,25005107,25003802,25004751],"score":42,"time":1604598611,"title":"The Canadian Mental Health Association has endorsed basic income","type":"story","url":"https://cmha.ca/news/the-universal-basic-income-an-idea-whose-time-has-come"}]
