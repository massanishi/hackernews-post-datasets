HN,<p>I am PhD student graduating soon and I am looking for career opportunities. I am having trouble with the job hunt though.<p>A little bit about me... I am not software engineer, but I do lots of programming in C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;OOP. I have done some advanced things, wrote many lines of code, and completed many projects. The catch is that I do all of my programming with the help of the interwebs.<p>I also work with the TCP&#x2F;IP abstraction. My research is in the networking field where I try to improve communication streams. I test protocols, modify them, design them, implement them, whatever I need to do. I usually do this using C&#x2F;C++.<p>I have an interest in security and cryptography. I took a few courses at school and I follow some online courses and forums. I implemented some crypto things for fun, such as AES-128 ECB, from scratch. I also worked on blockchain projects that required crypto knowledge and implementation of related methods. I implement my security&#x2F;crypto projects in C&#x2F;C++ as well.<p>The problem is that I am doing these job interviews where they ask me about implementing something for a BST or something similar.

object locally for offline use, but then also have that synced to the cloud for backup and to enable other features like sending emails and notifications containing users&#x27; content.<p>There are obviously plenty of straight-forward options to handle the local persistence (CoreData, SQLlite, Realm, etc.), and I&#x27;m happy to use any of them, but there seems to be no great option for persisting&#x2F;syncing the local stuff on the cloud.  Each of the options I&#x27;ve come across has significant drawbacks:<p>Realm Platform - prohibitively expensive (&gt; $2000&#x2F;year) if you want to access the server data to do anything other than communicate with a Realm client, also migrations are a pain<p>iCloud + CoreData - people might not have iCloud space or iCloud enabled<p>Google Cloud Firestore - in beta, some people experiencing issues with locally created objects not getting persisted, locked in to platform<p>Google Firebase Realtime - seems like this is effectively on the way to getting deprecated in favor of Firestore<p>Rolling my own solution where I write a background process to sync the client&#x27;s data with my Rails server - lots of complex code, prone to bugs<p>Any opinions on this problem or things I should consider?  Would be greatly appreciated!","time":1548305326,"title":"Ask HN: Best architecture for offline-first, cloud-synced mobile app?","type":"story"},{"by":"elamje","descendants":20,"id":18986005,"kids":[18989149,18987115,18990967,18986152,18988160,18986449],"score":10,"text":"Aside from the basic federal and state budget, such as costs of running government operations, would it be possible to allow voters to choose where their tax dollars go?<p>If so, what are the pros and cons compared to the current system in the US?<p>Concept:\nOnce the essential government costs are budgeted, the remaining portion will be allocated by voters based on their share of tax contribution.","time":1548304567,"title":"What are the pros and cons of elective government budget?(voters decide budget)","type":"story"},{"by":"dang","descendants":3,"id":18985974,"kids":[18990290,18989748],"score":20,"time":1548304084,"title":"Saussure: The accidental father of structuralism","type":"story","url":"https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/ferdinand-de-saussure-accidental-father-structuralism/"},{"by":"bane","descendants":50,"id":18985967,"kids":[18986452,18986578,18986454,18986543,18986438,18986639,18986671,18986512,18986253,18986603,18986462,19001895,18986410,18986271,18986647,18986488,18986726,18987506],"score":50,"time":1548303994,"title":"Palantir CEO rips Silicon Valley, accuses it of selling out America","type":"story","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/23/palantir-ceo-rips-silicon-valley-peers-for-sowing-seeds-of-division.html"},{"by":"Kortaggio","descendants":2,"id":18986070,"kids":[18986354,18986473],"score":11,"time":1548305353,"title":"List of topics characterized as pseudoscience","type":"story","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_topics_characterized_as_pseudoscience"},{"by":"scrumskeptic","descendants":30,"id":18985942,"kids":[18986805,18987215,18986820,18986840,18997807,18994386,18986466,18988637,18986777,18987043,18987669,18986411,18987553,18989204,18986758,18986585,18994849],"score":42,"text":"I’ve read the Michael O.

Workshops are limited in space, with reservation required.<p>Evening performances will be heavily based upon the algorave format, in which the dancefloor is accompanied by a look behind the veil, with several artists projecting a livestream of their code on screen. Performers will play energetic sets back to back, with minimal switch-over time.<p>Performers:\nMark Fell, W00dy, Renick Bell, Kindohm, Algobabez, Kit Clayton, TVO,\nShatter Pattern, William Fields, Spednar, Sebastian Camens, Digital\nSelves, Spatial, Vou, Wobbly, Charlie Roberts<p>hit me up with any questions, but hope to see of you there!","time":1548278891,"title":"Show HN: Algorithmic Art Assembly, San Francisco March 22-23rd 2019","type":"story"},{"by":"leothekim","descendants":1,"id":18983158,"kids":[18983214,18994375],"score":9,"time":1548278807,"title":"Jack Dorsey says Mark Zuckerberg served him a goat he apparently killed himself","type":"story","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-jack-dorsey-cold-goat-dinner-2019-1"},{"by":"chmaynard","descendants":134,"id":18983072,"kids":[18983920,18984777,18984164,18987829,18983598,18984652,18986228,18983373,18986291,18983202,18984614,18983973,18985047,18985355,18987831,18988022,18988436,18986786,18992846,18992833],"score":299,"time":1548278313,"title":"Queueing theory: The science of waiting in line","type":"story","url":"https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2019/01/23/queueing/"},{"by":"vahidfazelrezai","descendants":10,"id":18983040,"kids":[18984221,18984493,18983398],"score":40,"time":1548278102,"title":"Running Fast SQL on DynamoDB Tables","type":"story","url":"https://rockset.com/blog/running-fast-sql-on-dynamodb-tables/"},{"by":"curtis","descendants":164,"id":18983036,"kids":[18983572,18983399,18983233,18983197,18983221,18983822,18983217,18983162,18983360,18983604,18983594,18983892,18983242,18983865,18983365,18983795,18983559,18983301,18985001,18983218,18983660,18983766,18983358,18984020,18983275,18983733,18984006,18983498,18983166,18983446,19033844,18984618,18983277,18983288,18984500,18983817,18983339,18987445,18985975,18983535,18984431],"score":222,"time":1548278083,"title":"Customer Service Agents Can See What You're Typing in Real Time","type":"story","url":"https://gizmodo.com/be-warned-customer-service-agents-can-see-what-youre-t-1830688119"},{"by":"arduinomancer","descendants":58,"id":18982846,"kids":[18983335,18983100,18984494,18983684,18983714,18983925,18984285,18982999,18984144,18983147,18985209,18983211,18984002,18985781,18983891,18985767,18982979,18996825,19009766,18984965],"score":40,"text":"A big one for me is otherwise smart people who immediately start bashing&#x2F;complaining about a language&#x2F;framework that they just learned or aren&#x27;t familiar with.

I’m Rohan Pavuluri, co-founder of Upsolve (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upsolve.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upsolve.org&#x2F;</a>), a nonprofit in YC’s W19 batch. We provide software for low-income people in America that makes filing for bankruptcy less painful and expensive, just like what TurboTax did for filing taxes. Bankruptcy is a lifeline for low-income people in the United States who fall into debt from job loss, medical emergencies, and payday lenders. It allows them to get a fresh start. Unfortunately, it’s impossible for most people to file for bankruptcy because they cannot afford $2,000 for a bankruptcy lawyer. Our average user erases ~$40,000 in debt.<p>I started Upsolve when I was a law school research assistant in college. We were testing out the effectiveness of legal self-help packets for people who could not afford attorneys. I set out to turn these paper packets into a digital product. My co-founder Jonathan Petts spent ten years doing pro bono bankruptcies in his spare time as a corporate attorney. This is where he saw people turned down by brick and mortar legal nonprofits because demand for attorneys far exceeded supply. A judge introduced us in 2016 when she saw we were working on the same idea.<p>Here’s how it works. A user comes to our website and takes a screener to see if they’re a good fit for our service. If they are, they answer a series of questions about their personal finances, upload their tax returns&#x2F;pay stubs, and take a pre-bankruptcy education course. Our software then generates their forms, and one of our in-house attorneys reviews their forms for accuracy and completeness. If there are any issues, we follow up. When the forms are ready to file, we send them to the user. We track the user’s court notices so that we can fix any issues that may arise after filing. In 2018, we erased over $16,000,000 in debt for 400+ users.<p>We believe that 20M Americans would benefit from filing for bankruptcy. We currently allow our users to donate what they think is fair to us after they complete the process. While we’re mostly funded by foundations and the federal government now, we hope to be sustainable through donations that we receive from our users in the future. Regulations around bankruptcy only permit attorneys providing full-representation to charge clients.<p>We’re looking for any feedback you have on our product or how to reach new users.<p>User stories:

Again, not because of his differing views (we can agree to disagree), but because he is so unnecessarily vocal about them, which might deter future employees who take offense.<p>Any experiences or advice you can share?","time":1548110887,"title":"Ask HN: Co-found with someone very vocal about his politically incorrect views?","type":"story"},{"by":"whoisnnamdi","descendants":50,"id":18964361,"kids":[18964608,18965504,18964952,18964853,18964435,18966352,18964581,18964860,18964947,18967587,18967340,18965683],"score":207,"time":1548110850,"title":"Quinn 0.2.0: QUIC protocol implementation in Rust","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/djc/quinn/releases/tag/0.2.0"},{"by":"kousun12","descendants":17,"id":18964288,"kids":[18965298,18964705,18964632,18964441,18964785,18967266,18965136,18967643],"score":42,"time":1548110147,"title":"Show HN: FBP editor for music/vfx with [three, tone, tensorflow].js nodes","type":"story","url":"https://kousun12.github.io/eternal/"},{"by":"riyakhanna1983","descendants":9,"id":18964089,"kids":[18964367,18966401,18970386,18967363,18964395,18964614],"score":12,"time":1548108579,"title":"Ask HN: How do you assess the quality of open-source projects?","type":"story"},{"by":"mcdermott","descendants":5,"id":18964080,"kids":[18972901,18975382,18977747,18973923,18964606],"score":27,"time":1548108522,"title":"Speeding up Python with Nim","type":"story","url":"https://robert-mcdermott.gitlab.io/posts/speeding-up-python-with-nim/"},{"by":"ctrlaltdev","descendants":3,"id":18964088,"kids":[18964090,18966807],"score":15,"time":1548108576,"title":"Show HN: List of IPs making illegal auth attempts and users used doing so","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/ctrlaltdev/illegal-auth-attempts/"},{"by":"jonbaer","descendants":25,"id":18964007,"kids":[18965397,18966426,18966407,18965616,18966083,18966938,18964656,18966168,18965040,18966365,18966802,18964820],"score":121,"time":1548108039,"title":"Binder – Turn a Git repo into a collection of interactive notebooks","type":"story","url":"https://mybinder.org/"},{"by":"ZhuanXia","descendants":82,"id":18963811,"kids":[18963997,18963992,18964228,18964303,18967157,18963961,18963982,18963987,18967566,18967810,18964191,18963993,18963999],"score":125,"time":1548106415,"title":"When Jeff Bezos decided not to become a physicist [video]","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFnV6EM-wzY"},{"by":"crispinb","descendants":82,"id":18963722,"kids":[18964862,18964736,18965453,18965857,18964601,18965687,18964828,18964565,18964589,18967372,18966090,18964798],"score":119,"time":1548105549,"title":"Greenland’s Melting Ice Nears a ‘Tipping Point’","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/climate/greenland-ice.html"},{"by":"purplefruit","descendants":51,"id":18963649,"kids":[18963786,18963848,18964879,18964345,18965307,18974554,18966030,18966021,18968249,18963797,18964450,18968279],"score":78,"time":1548105054,"title":"How shutting out men from the conversation is an obstacle to change","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@sfard/me-n-too-b371a573d9ff"},{"by":"onetimemanytime","descendants":99,"id":18963574,"kids":[18964242,18964115,18964418,18963920,18964399,18964077,18963877,18964618,18963978,18963891,18964264,18964175,18964730,18965228,18964358,18964464,18964030,18964311,18964379,18964382,18964561],"score":78,"time":1548104512,"title":"Paradox of tolerance","type":"story","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance"},{"by":"oblib","descendants":8,"id":18963256,"kids":[18970935,18965889,18965108,18964911,18967190],"score":31,"time":1548101897,"title":"Evolutionary Advantages of an Addictive Personality","type":"story","url":"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-evolutionary-advantages-of-an-addictive-personality/"},{"by":"BossingAround","descendants":37,"id":18963154,"kids":[18963720,18963239,18963431,18963661,18963856,18964815,18965556,18963965,18963702,18963881,18963638,18964059],"score":49,"time":1548101149,"title":"Is It Time to Call the Butterfly Switch Keyboard an Engineering Failure?","type":"story","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/aiad2j/is_it_time_to_call_the_butterfly_switch_keyboard/"},{"by":"jason_slack","descendants":3,"id":18963028,"kids":[18993894,19037699],"score":2,"text":"I have a text processing project (and I asked a few questions about this here already).

I am so excited by the progress that I want to try and market this.<p>I did some market research (I&#x27;d rather still be vague, so as not to embarrass myself yet).  I have discovered there are basically 3-4 products that compete in this space and they are so niche that they each charge between $500 and $5000 a month for a license per user or by site.  Pricey stuff.<p>I basically have no cost in this yet other than whatever AWS is going to bill me and some of my own time.  I am considering something like charging $5 a month per user just to get a bunch of users onboard and traction established.  I don&#x27;t want to get in the habit of other freemium companies because I don&#x27;t ever want to cross that chasm.<p>To be fair I think I am looking at a segment of the market that has far more users of what I am making that these other groups are not addressing.

However, we&#x27;re big believers in having access to service and data that tell you more about YOU with no strings attached.<p>The thread from yesterday sparked an idea: what if we offered targeted genome sequencing direct to consumers?<p>The value props:<p>- We provide targeted gene sequencing on certain focus areas (cancer, inherited diseases, etc.) targeting 100&#x27;s of genes at a time<p>- We do true genome sequencing instead of genotyping. So instead of just going for certain SNPs, we do the full gene<p>- We provide deep coverage (eg. 200x) so that you get quality data<p>- We destroy your data once you confirm you receive it and never resell it or use it in aggregates (with a way to validate &amp; verify this to consumers)<p>- Price point would likely be around $100-$150 per test with around 1 month turnaround time<p>- You would get the raw data but no analysis<p>What I&#x27;m curious about is whether or not this would be something people would be interested in. In essence, we&#x27;d be giving you raw data for you to interpret on your own and do what you please with some light support&#x2F;direction from us on how to visualize the data.

am hoping you can help me out. I need a program like Delphi (Embarcadero) or App Builder (davidesperalta) in order to make v2 of my MVP.<p>I am currently checking the aforementioned out, am on the lookout for others.<p>My background in regards to this: I&#x27;m not a programmer, although I did learn programming many years ago, doing a few different languages, so I am not completely illiterate:<p>1. BASIC (Speccy, inputting programs from mags like C+VG amongst other things)<p>2. Turbo Pascal<p>3. Borland Delphi (I prefer something like this, object orientated stuff)<p>4. Bit of JS and Java<p>Required functionality of MVP v2, which is to be a desktop based up, no internet connection required:<p>1. Input data (numbers, strings) either in fields, or dropdowns<p>2. Store (local database)<p>3. Process (simple mathematical and statistical stuff, join strings and numbers, put inputted strings and numbers in to use-able dropdowns). It needs to also do pivot table type stuff, I assume a query to a database can do that, not sur. Basically what one can do in Excel.<p>4. Output in fields and graphs (pie, bar, radar)<p>My OS: Windows 10<p>Why an MVP v2: my idea, my startup, I have to take it as far as I can on my own. I do have some developers who want to work with me on this, but that&#x27;s not the point. I can de-risk this further, and just because someone wants to work with me, doesn&#x27;t mean I change my stance. Basically a person has to pay their dues in my book, including me. Of course, things might have moved on a bit too much for me.<p>Anyway, I just want something as simple as possible that I can use to create a desktop app, as quickly and as dirtily as possible.<p>Do you know of any such programs that can enable me to do this?<p>Cheers, Ace.","time":1547885390,"title":"Ask HN: Desktop Based Local App Builder (Like Delphi Hopefully)","type":"story"},{"by":"mbgaxyz","descendants":9,"id":18945763,"kids":[18946062,18945982,18945781,18946117],"score":8,"time":1547881833,"title":"Google VP told employees to stop using the word “family” after staff complaints","type":"story","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6605539/Google-staff-complained-word-FAMILY-offensive-homophobic-referring-children.html"},{"by":"juniusfree","descendants":80,"id":18945739,"kids":[18946493,18946542,18946471,18946581,18946389,18946386,18946565,18946574,18946277,18947178,18947155,18946433,18947845,18947589,18948555,18946495,18947060,18946746,18947735,18946592,18946278,18947662,18948288,18949857,18946246,18946355,18946585],"score":206,"time":1547881283,"title":"Who is horse_js?","type":"story","url":"https://whoishorsejs.com/"},{"by":"mathnmusic","descendants":5,"id":18945705,"kids":[18945733,18946657,18948051],"score":6,"text":"It so happens that I need serverless crontab + docker containers + programmatical access to container logs + per-second billing.

I typed the code I received.

Didn&#x27;t ask for credentials or email address. This seriously needs to be revised. At minimum Yahoo! should ask me to type the email address or the first and last name before sending me an SMS which contains an access code.

It&#x27;s a way for me to pursue a project I&#x27;ve been wanting to work on for a while, and also gives us a chance to give back to the community. We&#x27;re getting ready to release the &quot;alpha&quot; version within two weeks from today.<p>jobblast is a &quot;minimal&quot; job board for developers. My goal is to investigate job boards and the hiring process, in general, and create a tool that is truly beneficial to the developers looking for work as well as the companies that will hire them. All job posts are reviewed, by me, and they are free. There&#x27;s no cost to anyone and there are no ads.<p>The question for you is...<p>Are you hiring? Is the company you work for hiring developers? Feel free to check us out and get in touch. If you&#x27;d like to stay up to date with the project, you can subscribe to the newsletter with the link below. If you are hiring and would like to give us a try, you just need to shoot us an email (look below) and we will go from there! When we launch, your job posts will be the first that everyone will see.<p>I welcome any and all feedback. If you have questions for me, ask away! You can always get in touch at the email below, as well. I&#x27;m excited to see where this goes.<p>Some other questions worth considering...<p>1.) What struggles do you consistently have while searching for candidates for a developer position?<p>2.) What features would benefit you as a job seeker or hiring organization?<p>3.) Do you expect there to be a &quot;catch&quot; with a completely free job board?<p>4.)

The most important piece of code I&#x27;ve written was a rudimentary 2d tile engine in QB64 for an RPG I never finished. It&#x27;s memorable and important to me because of what writing it did for my confidence as a developer. At the time, writing a tile engine &quot;from scratch&quot;, in my mind, would make me a &quot;professional&quot;.<p>I had been following a Game Development YouTube series called &quot;Adventures In Game Development&quot;. I wanted to be a game developer! It was my dream! I was a novice developer when I took on that challenge. After a few articles and discussions with some people in various IRC channels, I began.<p>A few hours later, I saw a map appear that I had hardcoded which contained 0&#x27;s, 1&#x27;s. When I saw the square patch of grass with water in the middle (my clever map design), I thought I could accomplish anything. It was one of those moments that changed my life.<p>I&#x27;m not kidding when I say I had wanted to write a tile engine for a year, at least, before I was actually able to do it. I was probably around 14 years old, at the time.<p>I hope you enjoyed reading my answer to this question and I look forward to reading yours!<p><i>EDIT</i><p>I found the link to one of the articles I read when writing the tile engine.<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.petesqbsite.com&#x2F;sections&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;rpg_tut2.txt<p><i>EDIT 2</i><p>Another important piece of code I&#x27;ve written was the prototype for this game.<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hdfgame.com&#x2F;<p>I helped with the commercial version a bit but it was awesome to see my prototype turn into the first commercial game that I helped release.

We are focusing our efforts to support, motivate, and drive not only learning and career success for our students, but also to provide a world-class online learning experience.<p>Because the Udacity app has not significantly advanced students&#x27; ability to achieve their learning and career goals, moving forward we will not support many of these product upgrades on the mobile app and will sunset the mobile app as of January 9, 2019.

It&#x27;s been a time suck dealing with this company and their banking partners, I would recommend other founders who value their time to avoid this service. I&#x27;ve created an LLC in Delaware before using certain other googleable companies and it&#x27;s gone completely smoothly, so this isn&#x27;t my first rodeo.<p>First problem, Stripe will create a new, separate Stripe account for you to use with Atlas. So if you already had some transactions (hope you do if you&#x27;re forming a company) then you&#x27;re going to need to migrate them. For my company, they just created another account with exactly the same name and just one capitalization difference, pretty confusing. Migration is likely automatic with a cool company like Stripe, right? Nope, they only can migrate your customers -- everything else, subscriptions, coupons, tx data you need to write a script and DIY! Have fun wasting an afternoon updating all your API keys and re-testing too.<p>Side note, if you had special things like the Stripe startup school discount applied to your account, you&#x27;ll lose it on Atlas. Unless you open up another support ticket with Stripe and wait for a couple weeks.<p>Second problem, if you form a c-corp Stripe will create an account through SVB (Silicon Valley Bank) for you. You can go ahead and read the reviews on that bank yourself, but the biggest annoyance for me was a $25&#x2F;mo account maintenance fee. OK, not atypical for a business bank, but most banks don&#x27;t have a $25k+ min. balance for that fee! I do care about $300&#x2F;year for my company when I specifically payed for Stripe Atlas thinking it would be more convenient and save me money.<p>Third problem, want to switch to Azlo bank so that at least you don&#x27;t have to pay monthly fees? That&#x27;s great except Azlo will tell you that you need to talk to Stripe to do that, and <i>surprise</i> Stripe will tell you that...  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;mikob&#x2F;3cd3d141c60596ee50c0ab2603b5bdb9\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;mikob&#x2F;3cd3d141c60596ee50c0ab2603b5bd...</a>","time":1547085343,"title":"Tell HN: I Hugely Regret Using Stripe Atlas","type":"story"},{"by":"uji","descendants":282,"id":18870855,"kids":[18871483,18871456,18871345,18871538,18871574,18871459,18871352,18872445,18871550,18874444,18874933,18871612,18871499,18871520,18874351,18872381,18872812,18872605,18871771,18871381,18873792,18871576,18876915,18871543,18873358,18872577,18872620,18875261,18874632,18871965,18872413,18875826,18871404,18871337,18871347,18871638,18871446],"score":332,"time":1547084954,"title":"AWS gives open source the middle finger?","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/09/aws-gives-open-source-the-middle-finger"},{"by":"danso","descendants":75,"id":18870768,"kids":[18871069,18871095,18871591,18871059,18871799,18871043,18871106,18876947,18871051,18871107],"score":131,"time":1547084027,"title":"Oft-quoted paper on spread of fake news is retracted","type":"story","url":"https://retractionwatch.com/2019/01/09/oft-quoted-paper-on-spread-of-fake-news-turns-out-to-befake-news/"},{"by":"rohit33","descendants":4,"id":18870782,"kids":[18871141,18871198,18871022],"score":7,"time":1547084159,"title":"Will Microsoft Break the Internet?","type":"story","url":"https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/will-microsoft-break-internet.html"},{"by":"quickthrower2","descendants":188,"id":18870796,"kids":[18871344,18873827,18872210,18871762,18872460,18872286,18871360,18872256,18872155,18871836,18891757,18874687,18874230,18871166,18871162],"score":263,"time":1547084290,"title":"IBM releases Elm-powered app","type":"story","url":"https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/ibm-releases-elm-powered-app/2364"},{"by":"rococode","descendants":11,"id":18870745,"kids":[18872220,18872371,18871143,18872448,18873661,18871881,18871521,18871134,18871056,18872919],"score":8,"time":1547083690,"title":"Ask HN: Salary/equity aside, what would your ideal job offer consist of?","type":"story"},{"by":"prostoalex","descendants":43,"id":18870408,"kids":[18892324,18892602,18892577,18892007,18892363,18891618,18894091],"score":58,"time":1547079429,"title":"Truckers Reap New Riches","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-09/big-and-bulky-e-commerce-opens-new-road-to-riches-for-truckers"},{"by":"Bang2Bay","descendants":2,"id":18870406,"kids":[18870600,18870502],"score":3,"time":1547079413,"title":"No more 75kwh S or X from tesla","type":"story","url":"https://electrek.co/2019/01/09/tesla-discontinuing-75-kwh-battery-pack-model-s-model-x/"},{"by":"jedwhite","descendants":2,"id":18870400,"kids":[18870489,18876398],"score":3,"time":1547079345,"title":"Wireless Charging Tech Lets Drones Stay Aloft Indefinitely","type":"story","url":"https://futurism.com/drone-charging-mid-flight/"},{"by":"TsukiZombina","descendants":12,"id":18870399,"kids":[18871887,18871894,18870848,18872855,18870827,18871406,18873967,18870938,18874153],"score":141,"time":1547079334,"title":"Fun with compute shaders and fluid dynamics","type":"story","url":"https://blog.kummerlaender.eu/article/fun_with_compute_shaders_and_fluid_dynamics/"},{"by":"mattkenefick","descendants":3,"id":18870248,"kids":[18870261,18871315],"score":1,"time":1547077862,"title":"Merging two ini/env keyval files and remove duplicate keys using awk","type":"story","url":"https://gist.github.com/mattkenefick/6ff3d3b4b17c1e9f43d0908cf830bbd2"},{"by":"rmavis","descendants":68,"id":18870201,"kids":[18871071,18872117,18870718,18871310,18871952,18872240,18870689,18872334,18871906,18870926,18873999,18871727,18874122,18872469,18870658,18870857,18873474],"score":171,"time":1547077480,"title":"Using Web Technologies to Print a Book","type":"story","url":"http://richardmavis.info/using-web-technologies-to-print-a-book"},{"by":"zwendkos","descendants":19,"id":18870045,"kids":[18870845,18872771,18889950,18871687,18871401,18878210,18870135,18872749,18870364,18870232,18870193,18871062,18870731,18871303,18870390,18871878,18891749,18872076],"score":22,"text":"I&#x27;ll start: Teenage Engineering OP-1 Portable Synthesizer.

Firefox used to be my go to browser until a few years ago when the problems started appearing. On my old laptop with 2nd Gen i7 processor and 4gb RAM, I used to have more than 100 tabs open in all windows combined and Firefox could handle them without a hiccup(granted many sites were not that heavy 3-4 years ago but still compared to Chrome Firefox was miles better). Chrome always had a problem handling a lot of tabs(would show problems even at 30-40 tabs). But now I generally use a much powerful laptop(6th gen i7, 16gb ram, 980m graphics card) and Firefox&#x27;s performance is just terrible. The element inspector is a joke compared to Chrome and completely unusable. While I can go from one element to another in Chrome very easily, in Firefox the jump is very slow and choppy and until a few versions ago, highlighting the nodes in the element inspector would not even work everytime. Now even when I have 10 tabs open in Firefox, it briefly shows a spinning wheel when I go back to a previous tab. Chrome&#x27;s performance is much better now compared to Firefox. So, I am wondering if its because of the Rust powered Servo browser engine that derailed the performance of Firefox? I know Hacker News loves Rust dearly but lets be honest it has its share of warts and bugs. Will we ever get to see the once great Firefox in its full glory again? In hindsight, does the Firefox dev team regret using Rust instead of C++ for their browser engine?","time":1547017132,"title":"Is Firefox under performing because of its Rust powered engine, Servo?","type":"story"},{"by":"ganadiniakshay","descendants":120,"id":18862790,"kids":[18863579,18863231,18863343,18863566,18864206,18863687,18865073,18863750,18863623,18865452,18863932,18863482,18863475,18863754,18863521,18864184,18865742,18869439,18864244,18863383,18863756,18865473,18863574,18863353,18864018,18865426,18863336,18865335,18863809,18863939,18866084,18865350,18865301,18866308,18863529,18865900,18863804,18865286,18863646,18865183,18863803,18868804,18864038,18871007,18863450,18863424,18863626,18863355,18864263,18865580,18864106,18863639,18863943,18864623,18863408,18868011,18863818,18866052,18866276,18864161,18862797,18863502,18863760,18865440,18863714,18863949,18865056,18864510,18871781,18863828,18865660,18863934,18868188,18865631,18864922,18865302],"score":179,"text":"I started coding when I was 11 years old and I am 26 now so thats about 15 years.<p>All through this I have always enjoyed coding which is why I chose to study CS at college and then have been working as a dev post college.

HN!<p>We&#x27;re James and Angel, the founders of CSPA (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cspa.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cspa.io</a>).<p>The Computer Science Proficiency Assessment (CSPA) is a standardized assessment for software engineers.  We find software engineers to take our exam, and then share the assessment results with employers, who can then hire these candidates for free.<p>James was the founder of Crunchyroll and oversaw product and engineering.  Angel also worked at Crunchyroll.  We decided to start CSPA because:<p>1. There are many self-taught programmers out there who are really really good, but don&#x27;t get a fair chance because they don’t have a degree.  We want to give these people an equal opportunity to pursue their career.  That&#x27;s why there are no eligibility requirements to take the CSPA.  You can come from any background, and if you get a high CSPA score, you’ll stand out.<p>2. As hiring managers at Crunchyroll, it was challenging to find great software developers.  We wanted a service that <i>quantitatively</i> compares job applicants in an <i>unbiased</i> way, and ALSO did that assessment for us.  In short, we wanted candidates to come to us pre-assessed.  It would have saved us and the applicant a TON of time.<p>3. As software engineers, we hated applying for jobs.  We did the same phone screens, the same coding challenges, and same whiteboard exercises over and over again, company after company.  It&#x27;s a huge waste of time.  There has to be a better way.  Why couldn&#x27;t we just do it once, and then reuse the results at every company we apply to?  Keep it DRY, right?<p>If you want to take the CSPA, you can register here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cspa.io&#x2F;winter-2018&#x2F;register\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cspa.io&#x2F;winter-2018&#x2F;register</a>.  The first 100 people to sign up can use code &quot;LAUNCHHN&quot; to waive the exam fee.<p>If you&#x27;re an employer looking to hire a pre-assessed candidate, sign up here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cspa.io&#x2F;add-employer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cspa.io&#x2F;add-employer</a>.

a Chinese researcher named He Jiankui has created the world’s first CRISPR-Cas9 babies through his secret, self-funded research. The creation of the first genetically edited babies is like the opening of Pandora’s Box, which provokes uncertain and uncontrollable ethical concerns and social issues that could ultimately alter the future human world.\n\tGenome editing is no doubt an advanced technology with wonderful prospects. A well-known example is the malaria-resistant mosquito which had been predicted to have enormous impacts on human health. Similar experiments have been conducted on other animals samples to find out solutions to diseases and to develop medicines for the sake of improving modern biomedicine. However, the research done by He Jiankui was considered illegal and unethical. First of all, the experiment had not been reported to any public hospitals or medical ethics committees. Secondly, He Jiankui had violated the medical informed consent law. Lastly, he performed adoslucation and genome editing and planted the human embryos inside the female participants’ wombs. The nature of this experiment was no different from human experimentation, which has highly been considered morally wrong by any means. \nThere are also social issues caused by He Jiankui’s research. The biological and social effects on the girls are quite unpredictable. There could be other potential diseases caused by the immature technique of genome editing. \nAll in all, researches like He Jiankui’s should be banned. The twins were born to have a distinct identity than normal people and to be more difficult to get the society’s acceptance. The long term effects on them are waited to be verified by time. Further researches need to be done rigorously for advancing the future application of the technique to lower the possible risk and to guarantee the benefits.","time":1546780931,"title":"Final Project – First Gene-Edited Babies","type":"story"},{"by":"lproven","descendants":70,"id":18838124,"kids":[18838691,18840129,18838852,18839287,18838497,18838843,18861295,18838781,18878739,18839524,18841058,18838951,18838870,18839229,18839126,18839743,18838948,18839035],"score":89,"time":1546780008,"title":"C programmers with Mac experience wanted for revival of Eudora eMail client","type":"story","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/ad27vg/help_wanted_c_programmers_with_mac_experience/"},{"by":"kristerv","descendants":240,"id":18838115,"kids":[18838662,18839204,18839008,18838525,18838724,18838891,18838508,18838527,18838449,18838643,18838562,18838448,18839698,18838688,18839837,18839529,18838815,18839181,18838434,18840431,18839237,18839118,18838552,18844164,18838841,18838410,18838819,18838480,18839737,18839971,18839024,18838492,18841579,18838789,18838754,18841373,18839841,18838834,18840658,18838505,18945237,18838889,18838938,18838441,18839758,18840829,18839952,18838415,18838428,18838634,18839735,18838735],"score":317,"time":1546779758,"title":"Would you still pick Elixir in 2019?","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elixir/issues/102"},{"by":"rajnathani","descendants":4,"id":18838076,"kids":[18844512,18848658,18844936],"score":24,"time":1546779044,"title":"Training a Neural Network to Fall","type":"story","url":"https://semiengineering.com/training-a-neural-network-to-fall"},{"by":"meagher","descendants":111,"id":18838127,"kids":[18839596,18839834,18839015,18841617,18839477,18839880,18840488,18839248,18839484,18840582,18841041,18840666,18839520,18842533,18839795,18841586,18839396,18840463,18839342,18839296,18841511,18839470,18838997,18860373,18839579,18841860,18839727,18839458,18839722,18840243,18842064,18840467],"score":380,"time":1546780066,"title":"Build your own Mint","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/yyx990803/build-your-own-mint"},{"by":"adithvictor","descendants":5,"id":18838044,"kids":[18839690,18839498,18839962,18840514,18839242,18838837],"score":51,"time":1546778477,"title":"Show HN: Founder Stuff – A webpage for founders","type":"story","url":"https://founderstuff.xyz"},{"by":"keiferski","descendants":2,"id":18837954,"kids":[18838096,18838379],"score":3,"text":"A cafe?

We have angel funding and seed funding and are working our way towards proving our product is profitable for the next round.  I was brought aboard by the other half of the development team, the subject of this post, who recommended me to the founder&#x2F;CEO.<p>During my first few 3 months of being hired, we re-wrote the entire application to meet the requirements that the previous developers couldn&#x27;t meet due to them being junior and inexperienced (who were later fired).  When I say &quot;we&quot;, I really mean &quot;I&quot;.  This is where the problems lie.  The other developer on the team has productivity issues.  He has the title of &quot;principal engineer&quot; but he his full time duties are development oriented.  And he cannot perform.  When tasked with debugging software issues, he cannot solve them on his own.  When tasked with developing new components, he cannot make decisions or create them on his own.  He&#x27;s been in the business for many years, and I worked with him at our last job together, where he was let go for productivity reasons.  He is a smart individual, but he cannot produce, and he cannot &quot;play jazz&quot; to solve software problems.<p>On top of this, his personal life is a chaotic mess, and he is constantly clocking in late and signing off very early to babysit his young children.  Even if he could solve the issues he is tasked with, his personal life is so burdened with responsibility that he cannot put in the hours or focus required to complete the tasks.  His days are frequently interrupted by needing to pick up his kids or drop them off, or whatever else he needs to do.  These were the exact issues at our last startup job as well.<p>I, on the other hand, work my ass off.  I pull long hours all week.  I&#x27;ve always been productivity-oriented and have a high engineering standard for excellence.  I build big systems fast with great test coverage, and they meet requirements.  I don&#x27;t need anyone to hold my hand to step into a debugger or provision machines in our infrastructure.  I&#x27;m busting my ass to pull his weight along with mine.  I schedule work, prune our stories, assign what needs to be done, and then do my part in solving it.<p>I&#x27;m beginning to form a toxic opinion about this coworker.  I&#x27;m feeling very resentful towards him that he gets cut so much slack for his personal responsibilities.  I&#x27;m resentful that he can be pretending to work all week but have nothing to show for it at the end of the week except excuses about why he had trouble.  He&#x27;s not putting in what the founder and I are.  But he technically outranks me, so I cannot &quot;sit him down&quot; in the way someone with more authority could.  I could sit down with him as a peer, but he is known for snapping at people (even the founder) who question his productivity.  And I don&#x27;t think the discussion would have any positive outcome anyways.  His issues are systemic.<p>The founder knows all about this, and I&#x27;ve made it very clear to him how I feel.  He knows that I&#x27;ve written the vast majority of the systems and solved the vast majority of the issues we&#x27;ve encountered.  He knows we cannot rely on the underperforming employee for anything serious.  However, he won&#x27;t act because of how it looks to the outside.  It will look like he doesn&#x27;t know how to find good people.  It will look like internally we chaotic if we let him go, and that will hurt our chances of raising more funding.  I told him very recently though that it&#x27;s reaching a breaking point for me, and I cannot work with him any longer.<p>I need advice on how to proceed.  I am willing to walk away from the job if the founder won&#x27;t fire the other employee.  But I don&#x27;t want to be that guy that is like &quot;it&#x27;s either me or him.&quot;  I just want the founder to act on what we&#x27;ve agreed the situation to be.  He needs to fire this guy.  He costs money and drags down productivity by slowing the rest of us down.  And he kills morale.  How do I convince the founder that he can massage the staff change into something more palatable?  I know he doesn&#x27;t want to lose me...he&#x27;s made that abundantly clear.  But I also don&#x27;t want to be the one to put a gun to his head to make a choice.  But i&#x27;m at my wits end at dealing with this guy.","time":1546724944,"title":"Ask HN: Startup coworker underperforming","type":"story"},{"by":"dimensi0nal","descendants":44,"id":18834467,"kids":[18834905,18837039,18834924,18836982,18834537,18835140,18839869],"score":176,"time":1546724648,"title":"Someone is trying to steal archive.is's domain","type":"story","url":"https://twitter.com/archiveis/status/1081276424781287427"},{"by":"henning","descendants":48,"id":18834107,"kids":[18837379,18834699,18836642,18834559,18834416,18836769,18836877,18834367,18834470],"score":201,"time":1546720905,"title":"Rust at speed – building a fast concurrent database [video]","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s19G6n0UjsM"},{"by":"korisnicko_ime","descendants":25,"id":18833968,"kids":[18834661,18834579,18834617,18834793,18834633,18835160,18834029,18834967,18834684,18836925,18834729,18834258,18839152,18834646],"score":20,"text":"I don&#x27;t mean it in a get-rich-quick scheme sort of way.

You can use Sanos as a small kernel for embedded server applications written in C or as a JeOS (Just enough Operating System). Sanos has a fairly standard POSIX based API and an ANSI Standard C library.<p>The kernel was developed as part of an experiment on investigating the feasibility of running java server applications without a traditional operating system only using a simple kernel. A win32 layer allowed the Windows version of a standard HotSpot JVM to run under Sanos, essentially providing a JavaOS platform for server applications.<p>While Sanos is self-contained in the sense that it can build itself, it can be cross-compiled under either Windows using Microsoft Visual C, or under Linux using GCC. Sanos applications can either be built under Windows using MSVC or under Sanos itself using the Sanos SDK.<p>WWW: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jbox.dk&#x2F;sanos&#x2F;index.htm\nSource: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ringgaard&#x2F;sanos","time":1546659996,"title":"Sanos Operating System Kernel","type":"story","url":"http://www.jbox.dk/sanos/index.htm"},{"by":"justaguyhere","descendants":48,"id":18829691,"kids":[18829806,18830838,18831774,18831760,18831226,18831599,18831197,18830805,18831228,18831993,18829727,18830777,18835494,18831946,18833818,18831894,18832027,18836734,18833884,18831380,18831778,18833347,18831162],"score":160,"text":"Other than upwork, are there other sites that I can get started with?

What ends up happening is we go extended amounts of time without an overlap in free time and then miss out on dates, time with friends, etc.<p>We both love our work so quitting isn&#x27;t exactly helpful.<p>Some things we&#x27;ve tried:<p>Shared Google Calendar: This works well but we never <i></i>actually<i></i> update. Its tedious too. And we don&#x27;t like sharing exactly what we&#x27;re doing with our friends to coordinate schedules with.

Slash leaving it in our cars, it being outdated because of a change.<p>Text - We text each other schedule updates and text other friends with similar work&#x2F;life schedules a lot.

We haven&#x27;t tried that but I don&#x27;t generally see my less tech family&#x2F;friends using that.<p>This isn&#x27;t some existential crisis but we&#x27;ve really struggled to continually find time (and plan things out in advance when we have overlapping time) and others have to deal with this as well.<p>So any help would be appreciated.

like many companies we don&#x27;t have a great deal of documentation for our systems and no culture of creating decent documentation, all we have is a few scattered word documents in sharepoint which are fairly useless. Lately I&#x27;ve got an opportunity to improve things however and I&#x27;m trying to find the right system to produce complex documentation in a variety of formats (word doc, web, maybe others), I&#x27;ve mainly been looking at plain text based ones because they interact well with tools like graphviz for technical drawings and easy insertion of code samples. So far I&#x27;ve tried:<p>Latex: Probably the most powerful&#x2F;flexible but only really good at producing PDFs. Horrible error messages, no doc output and bad copy paste support (code snippets) are the biggest downsides that made me look at other options.<p>Markdown: Simple and ubiquitous, can output to just about any format, but a lack of support for many things like a glossary and ToC.<p>Texinfo: looks promising but I haven&#x27;t put any research into it yet so I&#x27;m not aware of downsides. Single page html output would be good for converting to doc and the GNU documentation is very nice, a seemingly sane table format.<p>Word&#x2F;Sharepoint: Horrible to work with, probably somewhat responsible for our lack of documentation.<p>Doxygen: I&#x27;ve used it in the past but it seems to be mostly geared toward API&#x2F;inline documentation, most of what I&#x27;m writing is higher level than that, but integrating with the code could be nice. It also seems to rely on authors to supply their own structure. Probably worth investigating further and living in the source repository is a positive.<p>At the moment it looks like Texinfo and Doxygen are the two to investigate, but I&#x27;d like to hear the opinion of HN members on them and to let me know of any other options.","time":1546483910,"title":"Ask HN: Best Documentation System?","type":"story"},{"by":"nitinreddy88","descendants":2,"id":18812410,"kids":[18812543,18812452],"score":7,"time":1546483688,"title":"Apple says cheap battery replacements hurt iPhone sales","type":"story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/2/18165866/apple-iphone-sales-cheap-battery-replacement"},{"by":"Snawoot","descendants":2,"id":18812263,"kids":[18812657,18812297],"score":4,"time":1546481704,"title":"Patch for Nvidia drivers unlocking NVENC sessions limit","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/keylase/nvidia-patch"},{"by":"absamer","descendants":6,"id":18812174,"kids":[18812201,18815770,18812200],"score":7,"text":"Guys - I need to understand if there is any kind of &quot;blind date&quot; meetups where technical cofounders can be met?

In particular, I&#x27;d love to know what bigger trends like the rise of serverless, the ascendance things like node.js and GO, and the reimagining of mobile web design might mean for an intro curriculum.","time":1546460699,"title":"Updating an “Intro to Web Design” Course","type":"story"},{"by":"mbrundle","descendants":143,"id":18809772,"kids":[18809822,18815665,18810115,18810868,18810095,18809971,18810060,18810203,18810980,18810073,18810118,18810558,18810253,18811805,18810361,18816714,18811726,18811143,18811594,18811836,18811290,18812772,18811461,18809932],"score":697,"time":1546460304,"title":"New Horizons’ first hi-res imagery of Ultima Thule","type":"story","url":"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/News-Center/News-Article.php?page=20190102"},{"by":"str33t_punk","descendants":2,"id":18809747,"kids":[18809794,18809999],"score":1,"text":"I have been working for a large internet corporation for the last year and, despite coding more often, I feel like I have lost touch of what is present and new in academia.<p>During my masters, my professor would provide me with stacks of papers to read in order stay on top of the current trends in Distributed Systems research.

I recently built and deployed my personal website, using self taught full stack technologies, something I&#x27;m thoroughly proud of. Languages I would use mostly are the regular web technologies and frameworks(JS, Vue, React etc), Python as the main language I would use and Bash (eh) for maintaining a project I&#x27;m working on. I have dabbled in Java before and I&#x27;m making it my 2019 goal to learn C++. I&#x27;m also trying to get a summer internship with one of the big tech companies here. While also trying to do all this, I&#x27;m also working a full time job (20-30hr&#x2F;week) in a retail position for the last 3 months (is my first job) Despite all this, I feel my priorities are all mixed up, or I&#x27;m unintentionally slowing myself down in some area. 2019 is here and I want it to go down a different path. Thing is I&#x27;ve heard a couple final year students doing my course say they&#x27;ve been looked down upon as having lackluster technical ability compared to full CS students, which worries me as I enjoy programming but want to set up my own business at some point in the next 2 years. Just looking for some advice on how to move forward with everything, maybe I have a little too much on my plate?","time":1546341340,"title":"Ask HN: What were you doing around the age of 18 – 20?","type":"story"},{"by":"hongchao","descendants":107,"id":18799643,"kids":[18800325,18802047,18801897,18800200,18800196,18800192,18802862,18799974,18800034,18800045,18799981,18799985],"score":98,"time":1546338083,"title":"Living and working in Sweden as engineers","type":"story","url":"http://hongchao.me/living-and-working-in-sweden-as-engineers/"},{"by":"mpweiher","descendants":24,"id":18799600,"kids":[18807739,18805295,18808652,18804867,18808746,18804927,18804797,18808975,18808002,18807083,18804871,18808543],"score":119,"time":1546336760,"title":"PANE: Programming with visible data","type":"story","url":"http://joshuahhh.com/projects/pane/"},{"by":"gricardo99","descendants":62,"id":18799541,"kids":[18800586,18799702,18800578,18800423,18800596,18799992,18799641,18801558,18799689],"score":183,"time":1546334837,"title":"A fifth of Earth’s geologic history might have vanished because of glaciers","type":"story","url":"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2018/12/part-earths-crust-went-missing-glaciers-may-be-why-geology/"},{"by":"monort","descendants":100,"id":18799550,"kids":[18805176,18805140,18807531,18805407,18807191,18808035,18805626,18805669,18805454,18807913,18845388,18805132,18807954,18806462,18806673,18808924,18805747,18805882,18805355,18805473],"score":72,"time":1546335317,"title":"The blind mind: No sensory visual imagery in aphantasia","type":"story","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29175093"},{"by":"bladecatcher","descendants":21,"id":18799522,"kids":[18802552,18801553,18801743,18811715,18801234,18804263,18800945,18802764,18801164],"score":53,"time":1546334089,"title":"How Well Do We Understand Probabilities in Medicine?

His proposition is that by January 1 2020:\n1. The top 6 US companies (Uber, Palantir, Airbnb, Dropbox, Pinterest, and SpaceX) which at the time were worth just over $100B, will be worth at least $200B.\n2.

The YC Winter 2015 batch - worth at the time around $0—will be worth at least $3B.<p>One person, Boston-based VC Michael de la Maza, agreed to bet $100,000 against Altman, with the loser agreeing to donate the money to a charity of the winner’s choice.<p>One year to the deadline, what’s the status?<p>I checked the known public valuation of the mentioned companies, using news sources and company announcements.

I live in a rural&#x2F;country suburb of Houston TX about 40 Miles from downtown Houston.<p>Currently, we have their &quot;double play&quot; service which is the following:\n1) 1Gbps cable modem.(I can get pretty close to that most of the time.) Currently that is the maximum available in my area.\n2) pretty much every channel they offer that isn&#x27;t an international, porn or other niche channel. We have a large family of 7, so there are 5 cable boxes.<p>That runs me around 180 per month in USD. Personally, I would like to cut the cord on cable, but its not really a huge savings to be had, and the spouse isn&#x27;t ready to do that yet... I have managed to reduce costs somewhat by using roku boxes and purchasing my own cable modem. If there were other choices in my area, I can assume that would bring down costs. I don&#x27;t know that I have any other complaints though. Comcast has generally been hated since their inception, and I do feel like things have improved somewhat.","time":1546225003,"title":"Ask HN: ISP Survey","type":"story"},{"by":"jedwhite","descendants":3,"id":18792691,"kids":[18792854,18793024,18793078],"score":2,"time":1546223920,"title":"Netflix movie 'Black Mirror: Bandersnatch' to change the way we watch TV – again","type":"story","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/netflix-movie-black-mirror-bandersnatch-wants-change-way-we-watch-ncna952951"},{"by":"sahin-boydas","descendants":2,"id":18792591,"kids":[18792596,18792728],"score":3,"time":1546222188,"title":"NYC cops will fly a drone over the New Year’s Eve celebration at Times Square","type":"story","url":"https://www.apnews.com/0130ee16062c46c49a7244e721a4fca4"},{"by":"cjmb","descendants":140,"id":18792515,"kids":[18792934,18792673,18792883,18794600,18792824,18792860,18794715,18792546,18792884,18794464,18793898,18792999,18793648,18793630,18792841,18794350,18794103],"score":292,"time":1546220748,"title":"The Uncharity of College: The Big Business Nobody Understands","type":"story","url":"https://www.conradbastable.com/essays/the-uncharity-of-college-the-big-business-nobody-understands"},{"by":"neom","descendants":4,"id":18792497,"kids":[18792558,18814814,18792621,18804630],"score":6,"text":"I was looking over job postings tonight and saw &quot;Strong analytical skills in the area of scalar wave theory, partial differential equations, perturbation theory, nonlinear analysis techniques in wave propagation for acoustics and optics.&quot; with &quot; Knowledgable&#x2F;Experience on statistical mechanics, quantum theory as applied to gases.&quot; - I was curious as to how this engineering might be applied to future consumer technologies?","time":1546220350,"title":"Ask HN: Why would a company like Apple hire a scalar wave researcher?","type":"story"},{"by":"DoreenMichele","descendants":10,"id":18792389,"kids":[18794931,18797048,18795259,18794884],"score":178,"time":1546218800,"title":"Nancy Grace Roman, 'Mother of Hubble' Space Telescope, Has Died","type":"story","url":"https://www.npr.org/2018/12/30/680994535/nancy-grace-roman-mother-of-hubble-space-telescope-has-died"},{"by":"danabramov","descendants":79,"id":18792373,"kids":[18792972,18794338,18793225,18793087,18793017,18793626,18793498,18828741,18793508,18793584,18794597,18793706,18796327,18794678,18794427,18794002],"score":468,"time":1546218597,"title":"The Elements of UI Engineering","type":"story","url":"https://overreacted.io/the-elements-of-ui-engineering/"},{"by":"elsewhen","descendants":11,"id":18792313,"kids":[18794462,18794112,18793764,18794798],"score":33,"time":1546217896,"title":"Where in the World Is Larry Page?","type":"story","url":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/where-in-the-world-is-larry-page-11546199677"},{"by":"jelliclesfarm","descendants":15,"id":18792248,"kids":[18792361,18792358,18792378,18792370,18792438,18794370,18792412],"score":13,"time":1546217027,"title":"How Google Maps calculates the shortest distance","type":"story","url":"https://mathsection.com/how-google-maps-calculates-the-shortest-route/?cookie-state-change=1546194774335"},{"by":"rocky1138","descendants":3,"id":18792227,"kids":[18792496,18792491],"score":5,"time":1546216750,"title":"Why Louisiana Stays Poor","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWTic9btP38"},{"by":"tlrobinson","descendants":130,"id":18792174,"kids":[18802299,18792547,18802714,18802643,18802920,18804052,18803521,18803098,18804471,18804131,18802599,18802254,18805804,18802842,18802961,18805080,18804463,18802698,18802803,18803184,18802445,18802156,18807197,18804570],"score":172,"time":1546215980,"title":"Russian Cosmonauts Say That the Hole in the Soyuz Was Drilled from the Inside","type":"story","url":"https://www.universetoday.com/140996/russian-cosmonaut-says-that-the-hole-in-the-iss-was-drilled-from-the-inside/"},{"by":"ihucos","descendants":18,"id":18792164,"kids":[18792736,18792740,18793054,18792587,18794106,18794100,18792595],"score":20,"time":1546215821,"title":"Show HN: Avenv – A more isolated virtualenv","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/ihucos/avenv"},{"by":"wallflower","descendants":202,"id":18792029,"kids":[18792268,18792337,18792517,18792292,18792960,18792343,18792184,18792306,18792415,18792359,18792857,18792393,18793168,18792435,18792760,18792285,18792815,18793141,18795300,18794031,18792357,18794249,18792889,18792344,18793840,18794875,18792560,18792277,18793356,18794559,18793063,18794829,18792747],"score":148,"time":1546213347,"title":"Button offers instant gratification for those plagued by airplane noise","type":"story","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/button-offers-instant-gratification-for-those-plagued-by-airplane-noise/2018/12/29/c1035d32-02e1-11e9-b5df-5d3874f1ac36_story.html"},{"by":"bluelaguna","descendants":7,"id":18791867,"kids":[18792030,18792066,18791872],"score":1,"text":"Apparently, I can&#x27;t post a .live domain.

Yet, I&#x27;ve never made a close, loyal friendship, only casual friendships.<p>Before, I&#x27;ve been looking forward to college so I can study my interests.

But also, the non-wordy appendix is the kind of quick reference that I like to use (don&#x27;t have to reread through paragraphs just to get to the point).<p>So imagine you were to spend four years of ALL your free time on a project. Also, you are not rich or particularly intelligent. If it were a math website that thousands of people used and actually found helpful ...that wouldn&#x27;t be too bad (imo). But if you spend all that time and no one finds it useful then I&#x27;m afraid that&#x27;s a little bigger than just a failed project. That&#x27;s more like a failed interpretation of the world around you. That&#x27;s more like, well, going down the rabbit hole. No one wants to be the fool who spent 4 years on a math website that never caught on.<p>Whenever I google a math topic I expect to get a mix of pdf worksheets (with or without answers), 10 minute youtube videos (with or without answers), and horrendously formatted math websites. Yes, there is brilliant.org but they seem to be a typical business (social media, popup login screen, click-bait questions) and less focused on providing an easy and open reference. Plus their appendix isn&#x27;t responsive and is too wordy.<p>So I think the site can still fill a niche.

The contract I signed has me receiving a percent of whatever hourly rate the firm I contract though bills that particular client. Six months into the gig, the firm asks if I would be willing to change from a percentage to a flat rate. I know that the rate they bill varies, considerably greater for short term contracts, so I said no and explained my reasoning. There was a little hemming and hawing, but they dropped the request.<p>Well, they brought it up again this month. Again, I said no. They said they could have one of their full time people do the work. I said that was fine.

I&#x27;ve given my data over to Google for two decades.  Suffice to say, Google knows more about me than anyone or anything.  All of my email is hosted by gmail and has been for a long time.<p>I&#x27;ve been making final preparations for suicide in the past few weeks: Gave away my net worth, cut ties with peers, wrote my suicide note (also indexed by Google), and so on.  I inked and submitted the formal documents required to donate my wealth last week (no income or assets remaining), and sent a gmail informing recipients of the substantial donation, and that I will be falling off the grid.<p>I&#x27;ve been googling for &#x2F; obtaining items needed to successfully complete a peaceful self-termination.  One thing I forgot to consider was adult diapers.  A few days ago, after I had written my google-indexed suicide note and after completing the wealth transfer (confirmed via gmail), Google showed me an ad for adult diapers, which is an ad unlike any I&#x27;d ever seen before that.  I wasn&#x27;t searching specifically for items related to completing a peaceful self-termination at that precise moment but did search for fireman&#x27;s masks a week prior.  The gmail-confirmed wealth transfer was completed 48 hours before seeing the ad.<p>As it turns out, I do in fact need to obtain such diapers and had forgotten to consider obtaining them.  Thus, Google was spot-on the mark in recommending them to me for a highly relevant purpose (to complete self-termination).  Since Google almost certainly has algorithms to determine probability of suicide, is it possible that Google determined that adult diapers were a relevant item to advertise to me after concluding that my suicide was imminent?<p>This isn&#x27;t a coded cry for help, etc.  Thanks for respecting my privacy and addressing the inquiry about Google objectively.

It’s important that you do not create any new orders during this time. Once we have an update we will notify you. Please note that once an order has been canceled, we are unable to reinstate it. (...) Alternatively, you can order through one of our retail partners. Details on this option can be found by clicking here.&quot;<p>So I did try a &#x27;retail partner&#x27; with the same result - order cancelled.<p>Then 2 days later (today) &quot;Thank you for your patience while we reviewed the situation. Our apologies for the delayed response. We have re-reviewed the cancellation and determined it was done by our system unintentionally. We would like to request that you please create a new order and message us back with the order number. Once we have the new order number, we will review it to ensure there aren&#x27;t any issues.&quot;<p>Needless to say, I will not order from Oculus as it will never arrive on time for Christmas.<p>The same credit card, phone number and address worked just fine for getting a laptop from Microsoft, but not for getting an Oculus from a Oculus &#x27;partner&#x27; that had it in stock.<p>So I&#x27;m really wondering what happened, and if Facebook is using its database to flag orders as the only unusual thing about me is that I do not maintain a Facebook profile.<p>I really wonder if that&#x27;s what caused the issue? It is too easy to blame their &#x27;system&#x27; without telling why.<p>So I&#x27;m asking here: did anyone else experience similar problems when ordering from Oculus?<p>They haven&#x27;t told me why the order was &#x27;unintentionally&#x27; cancelled, and I doubt they ever will.

I&#x27;m 31, technical, and working at a Prestigious Tech Company (PTC). Live in NYC. An engineer most of my career, and in the last few years, some BD too. I&#x27;ve started companies before : once when I was 24 (solo) and once when I was 27 (cofounder). Both profitable, and the latter growing fast w&#x2F; a recently closed series B. I left that company very early because of a life tragedy, but have regretted it ever since.<p>Last ~4 years at Prestigious Tech Company (PTC) have been mixed. Great to have stability, to travel and to work with smart people. But near impossible to get truly motivated.<p>For much of the past year I&#x27;ve been quietly building, and have a new MVP that I have very strong conviction in. Felt motivated again. Believe the business is decently validated via talking to and onboarding some early users.<p>I&#x27;d like to raise some funding and run with this, BUT:<p>a) PTC may IPO in ~2020 which makes staying almost certainly the safer financial decision.<p>b) The &#x27;society&#x27; at PTC is awesome. Having a place to go &#x2F; big group of smart and ethical people to hang out with. I recall some of the loneliness&#x2F;unhappiness of my first solo business.<p>c) Most importantly: I don&#x27;t have a non-technical cofounder. I&#x27;m under-networked. Used to see that as a positive attribute (ha) - now it&#x27;s just frustrating. Despite being mildly tech-twitter-famous I don&#x27;t have many real connections w&#x2F; cofounder types in my life. Worried that when it comes to raise my inability to have attracted a cofounder will be a negative signal. Founding with a relative stranger may also be a relatively negative signal &#x2F; bad idea.<p>HN: What would you do in my shoes? Is my failure to have built this network over the years a sign that I shouldn&#x27;t pursue this?

and &quot;pleasure&quot; in a way that pays the bills without making serious compromises.<p>Realistically, what are the best options for coming as close to this ideal as possible?","time":1545364877,"title":"Ask HN: How little work can you get away with and still have the basics?","type":"story"},{"by":"wizdumb","descendants":61,"id":18731322,"kids":[18731325,18736778,18731902,18736907,18736489,18736758,18738336,18736926,18736215,18735976,18741572,18736987,18738488],"score":134,"time":1545364691,"title":"Experiment: Recoil vs. Muzzle Velocity","type":"story","url":"https://blog.ammolytics.com/2018-12-12/experiment-recoil-vs-muzzle-velocity.html"},{"by":"duck","descendants":3,"id":18731277,"kids":[18731335,18731521],"score":3,"time":1545363935,"title":"Tontine","type":"story","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tontine"},{"by":"hsikka","descendants":4,"id":18731267,"kids":[18731353,18731286],"score":5,"time":1545363744,"title":"15 Moonshots in AI and Bio to work on in 2019","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@HarshSikka/15-ideas-and-moonshots-to-work-on-in-2019-a6967f739cce"},{"by":"sahin-boydas","descendants":164,"id":18730933,"kids":[18731697,18731471,18732443,18731548,18731189,18732477,18732079,18733653,18731693,18731475,18735397,18730945,18733513,18731653,18731588,18731426,18731410,18731761,18731593,18735209,18731511,18731777,18739518,18731472,18731737,18738600,18731348,18737169,18732098],"score":536,"time":1545357808,"title":"Changes to U.S. federal authorities relating to production and marketing of hemp","type":"story","url":"https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm628988.htm"},{"by":"samrohn","descendants":30,"id":18730938,"kids":[18731522,18731507,18731850,18734704,18747251,18731420,18734092,18732198],"score":294,"time":1545357927,"title":"Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures Using Python","type":"story","url":"http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html"},{"by":"k1m","descendants":6,"id":18730829,"kids":[18731255,18731246],"score":49,"time":1545356186,"title":"Twitter Locks WikiLeaks and Multiple WikiLeaks Staff Accounts","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@caityjohnstone/twitter-locks-wikileaks-and-multiple-wikileaks-staff-accounts-c9deb33e0592"},{"by":"tareqak","descendants":124,"id":18730778,"kids":[18731587,18732414,18734031,18731775,18732144,18734036,18732906,18731647,18731541,18731676,18733416,18732260,18733152,18732810,18732205,18732292,18731770,18734322,18732552,18731721,18732625,18732758,18731714,18732488,18732390],"score":133,"time":1545355600,"title":"Facebook Is Developing a Cryptocurrency for WhatsApp Transfers, Sources Say","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-21/facebook-is-said-to-develop-stablecoin-for-whatsapp-transfers"},{"by":"x43b","descendants":23,"id":18730784,"kids":[18730959,18730999,18731024,18732691,18740588,18730956,18731022],"score":32,"time":1545355662,"title":"Idiots with drones have shut down the UK’s second largest airport","type":"story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/20/18149819/london-gatwick-airport-drone-shutdown-reports"},{"by":"Eschatologist","descendants":129,"id":18730749,"kids":[18731312,18731273,18731131,18731347,18731065,18731176,18733695,18731002,18732564,18731135,18732667,18734268,18732424,18731477,18732367,18733432,18731400,18734485,18734991,18731052,18732062,18733210,18731894,18731056,18731531,18731506,18731349],"score":236,"time":1545355175,"title":"At Blind, a security lapse revealed private complaints from tech employees","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/20/blind-anonymous-app-data-exposure/"},{"by":"wolfgke","descendants":84,"id":18730687,"kids":[18734191,18734144,18731702,18733975,18732936,18733841,18734320,18733154,18733957,18731699],"score":66,"time":1545354235,"title":"Central Banks Have Few Options to Deal With Another Crisis","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-12-15/central-banks-have-few-options-to-deal-with-another-crisis"},{"by":"mlthoughts2018","descendants":187,"id":18730588,"kids":[18731167,18730865,18730888,18731504,18730875,18730855,18732025,18733218,18730968,18731942,18731468,18731261,18730936,18733233,18730904,18730854,18731100,18731927,18731337,18734160,18735757,18731443,18731411,18731023],"score":193,"time":1545352896,"title":"Great Pacific garbage patch cleanup fails to collect plastic","type":"story","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/20/great-pacific-garbage-patch-20m-cleanup-fails-to-collect-plastic"},{"by":"JessicaTG","descendants":30,"id":18730468,"kids":[18731340,18731388,18732462,18732277,18730629,18732757,18732567,18734228,18731264,18731786,18736243,18734428,18730641,18731663,18731372,18733334,18731670,18738829,18732157],"score":28,"text":"Hi HN!<p>So recently I applied for a software engineering role at a startup. A week and a bit ago I had an interview where they and I chatted for a bit and got to know each other a little, which I thought went swimmingly. Yesterday however, was my technical screen. I was confident but nervous beforehand, but when it started that&#x27;s when my mind froze, I couldn&#x27;t think at all and I was just a bumbling mess. It was by no means a difficult problem and almost immediately afterwards and when the pressure was gone the solution became obvious to me, but by then I knew it was too late to change anything.<p>Stuff like this happens to me all the time. Not every time I&#x27;m being judged in person, but every time I&#x27;m being judged where I need to think and I _need_ to succeed and I&#x27;m not in a position of power. I just get so much anxiety and my mind completely shuts down. It has caused me to fail things I shouldn&#x27;t have. Not only technical interviews, but e.g. my first driving test I just freaked out and so couldn&#x27;t pass it. Examinations at school I am fine as I don&#x27;t have another person in front of me judging me.<p>The software engineering job I am currently at is a consultancy agency, but probably the only reason why I was offered it a few years ago was because I didn&#x27;t have to do a technical interview. If I had, I probably would have failed that too.<p>I couldn&#x27;t sleep at all last night, the night after the interview. And the email I was dreading I received this morning. As soon as I saw the rejection I just burst out crying uncontrollably. It took me an hour to regain my composure to send a reply email thanking them for their time and wishing them success. I broke down not so much because I failed, but because of _why_ I failed. Even now, hours after the fact, I am still quite shaken.<p>I was wondering if you or others in this community have experienced something similar, and what steps you have taken to remedy it?<p>Thank you all so much in advance!<p>Jess :-)","time":1545351504,"title":"Ask HN: Getting over interview anxiety?","type":"story"},{"by":"xtacy","descendants":8,"id":18730436,"kids":[18731959,18730985],"score":58,"time":1545351150,"title":"Mathematics in the 20th Century (2002) [pdf]","type":"story","url":"http://www.math.tamu.edu/~rojas/atiyah20thcentury.pdf"},{"by":"pplonski86","descendants":3,"id":18730380,"kids":[18730434,18734405],"score":14,"time":1545350532,"title":"Quotient Types for Programmers","type":"story","url":"https://www.hedonisticlearning.com/posts/quotient-types-for-programmers.html"},{"by":"dennis_jeeves","descendants":2,"id":18730347,"kids":[18730635,18730624,18731161],"score":1,"text":"I work for a firm with under 20 employees and I have the option to opt out of health care insurance provided by the firm if needed.<p>My employer offered insurance premium for the year 2019 works out to be around $5000 for an individual, which I thought was outrageous.

I am building Oliv to take a stand.<p>I am a software engineer turned manager. I am guilty of enthusiastically introducing Slack in my previous organization, only to realize how it killed the pockets of focus time that my engineers need to be productive. Once you introduce Slack in an organization, all communication becomes synchronous, even if only 10% of it needs to be, and Slack’s notifications start controlling everybody’s attention.<p>Oliv is a slackbot that manages your Slack status &amp; Do Not Disturb based on your calendar. Oliv also auto responds and takes messages for you &#x2F; escalates as needed when you are unavailable for a longer period of time.<p>Here’s how my team and I use Oliv today to create focus and manage expectations around communication:<p>1. We make it a habit to schedule couple of 2h “focus time” blocks for every day on every engineer’s calendar. During that time, Oliv sets Do Not Disturb, updates the status to “is heads down” and takes messages to show later when the focus time ends.<p>2. For me, when I am in meetings, Oliv updates my status to “in meetings till 4p”, etc. so that my team knows I won’t be able to respond immediately.<p>3. During vacations, Oliv sets our status to “On vacation till Dec 31”, etc. and takes messages on our behalf.

My team and I created Flockjay to make tech accessible for people from underrepresented communities. We&#x27;re doing this by targeting a branch of the industry that itself has been neglected in this age of engineering bootcamps: a $0-upfront online sales academy that gives underserved jobseekers the tools and training they need to break into tech.<p>Startups are building formal sales processes earlier in their life cycles. Many struggle with predictably hiring top talent for sales. Skilled sales reps are critical for growing startups, as they accelerate revenue (4-5x their compensation) while understanding what customers want. Top performers are hard to find because they often come from non-traditional backgrounds. They are conscientious, curious, and emotionally intelligent, and have honed their skills through experience and mentorship.<p>As an industry, we focus most of our energy on teaching people to code. Yet, in a recent poll of 250 US college and university officials, not one school offered coursework in tools like Salesforce. Meanwhile, the best sales reps are amongst the highest earners in tech. Providing this training can create economic opportunity that changes lives.<p>I have witnessed the power of education and access in my own life. As a son of non-white immigrants, I grew up with a narrow view of opportunity. Then, 22 years ago, my parents crossed the street and asked our neighbors why their kids’ bus went one way, and mine went another. I applied for a scholarship to their private school, and my entire worldview changed.<p>After college, I taught financial literacy in inner-city Chicago and NY. Many of my students felt overlooked in tech job searches despite being qualified. They didn’t speak the tech language, rarely had an industry connection, and lacked fluency in business software. If they did land the dream job, there was often a steep learning curve with little training or support.<p>We built Flockjay to bridge this skills gap. Over 12 weeks part-time, students receive expert coaching, interview with top companies, and join a community of mentors. Our hired graduates make 2x or more their current income, while making real impact at breakout tech companies. They develop life-long skills for any professional transition.<p>Our team has 10+ years of domain expertise, and with help from world-class professionals (Facebook, Flexport, Google, etc.) we’ve developed a fully-immersive curriculum that uses cutting-edge tools (Summary: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flockjay.com&#x2F;applicants\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flockjay.com&#x2F;applicants</a>). Our students pay nothing until hired, after which we take 10% of their first year income.<p>We are working with groups representing different races, genders, sexual orientations, socioeconomic&#x2F;educational backgrounds, geographic locations, and ages to attract high potential applicants. You can read more about our view of diversity here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flockjay.com&#x2F;diversity\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flockjay.com&#x2F;diversity</a>.<p>We are from places like Mississippi and Ghana, and we are building a radical company to reflect the change we want to see in the world. What we’ve learned so far is there is no single story of success. We want to hear your experiences, ideas, feedback, and stories about breaking into tech. They have been the most meaningful part of our work.","time":1545329358,"title":"Launch HN: Flockjay (YC W19) – $0-upfront tech sales academy for diverse

think there is a hidden reason behind that the media has been raging against Facebook and Zuckerberg for the last couple of years. I guess the Russia collusion and data collection scandals are pure pretexts for the real reason which is that Facebook changed its feed algorithm 3 or 4 years ago so that Facebook pages became simply dead. Views and interactions have became very low even for pages with millions of likes and followers. An ordinary Facebook post that could simply get 10,000 likes in 2014 can&#x27;t even get 100 likes now. Even with lots of money paid to Facebook to promote posts, you still can&#x27;t get half the exposure you got 3 or 4 years ago for free. Facebook made many changes so that users stay in Facebook as long as possible including making it harder to view YouTube videos inside Facebook and blatantly allowing stealing videos from YouTube. And unlike most other social media outlets, Facebook doesn&#x27;t reward influencers and popular pages for doing a good job. It&#x27;s like everybody knew that Zuckerberg got greedy and wanted every cent for himself only. And now publishers and media outlets are seeing the opportunity to punish Zuckerberg for his greed. I also think Facebook&#x27;s feed algorithm change is the real reason why Reddit became even more popular in the last 3 years for example.","time":1545320974,"title":"Ask HN: Is this the real reason of the crusade against Facebook and Zuckerberg?","type":"story"},{"by":"koops","descendants":176,"id":18725971,"kids":[18726715,18727284,18727618,18726311,18726274,18728405,18731965,18727183,18727208,18727295,18728927,18727590,18731757,18728170,18726280,18734512,18727412],"score":211,"time":1545321458,"title":"Rising Waters Are Drowning Amtrak's Northeast Corridor","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-amtrak-sea-level/"},{"by":"alanfranzoni","descendants":34,"id":18725824,"kids":[18728324,18732137,18726894,18727025,18726983,18726906,18727261,18726769,18726686,18727160],"score":69,"time":1545320664,"title":"Imperfect Forward Secrecy: How Diffie-Hellman Fails in Practice","type":"story","url":"https://jhalderm.com/pub/papers/weakdh-cacm19.pdf"},{"by":"tjmehta","descendants":2,"id":18725768,"kids":[18754349,18727327],"score":3,"time":1545320303,"title":"Show HN: JavaScript utils to easily get and set deep keypaths","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/tjmehta/keypather"},{"by":"howard941","descendants":23,"id":18725857,"kids":[18728924,18728709,18727367,18727281,18727567,18730719,18726831,18727294],"score":75,"time":1545320851,"title":"Why Is America So Angry?

Getting information from recorded phone calls and meetings is time-intensive, costly, and imprecise. Our speech recognition API allows businesses to reliably translate high-value unstructured audio into accurate, parsable data.<p>Deepgram started when my cofounder Noah Shutty and I had just finished looking for dark matter (while in a particle physics lab at University of Michigan). Noah had the idea to start recording all audio from his life, 24&#x2F;7. After gathering hundreds of hours of recordings, we wanted to search inside this fresh dataset, but realized there wasn’t a good way to find specific moments. So, we built a tool utilizing the same AI techniques we used for finding dark matter particle events, and it ended up working pretty well. A few months later, we made a single page demo to show off “searching through sound” and posted to HN. Pretty soon we were in the winter batch of YC in 2016 (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;09&#x2F;27&#x2F;launching-a-google-for-sound-deepgram-raises-1-8-million&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;09&#x2F;27&#x2F;launching-a-google-for-sou...</a>).<p>I’d say we didn’t know what we were getting ourselves into. Speech is a really big problem with a huge market, but it’s also a tough nut to crack. For decades, companies have been unable to get real learnings from their massive amounts of recorded audio (some companies record more than 1,000,000 minutes of call center calls every single day). They have a few reasons why they record the audio — some for compliance, some for training, and some for market research. The questions they’re trying to answer are usually as simple as:<p><pre><code>  - “What is the topic of the call?” \n  - “Is this call compliant?” (did I say: my company name, my name, and “this call may be recorded”)\n  - “Are people getting their problems solved quickly?” \n  - “Do my agents need training?” \n  - “What are our customers talking about? Competitors? Our latest marketing campaign?”\n\n</code></pre>\nIt’s the most intimate view you can get on your customers, but the problem is so large and difficult to solve that companies pushed it into the corner over the past couple decades, only trying to mitigate the bleeding. Current tools only transcribe with around 50-60% accuracy on real-world, noisy, accented, industry-specific audio (don’t believe the ‘human level accuracy’ hype). When companies start solving problems using speech data, they first want transcription that’s accurate. After accuracy, comes scale — another big problem. Speech processing is computationally expensive and slow. Imagine trying to get into an iterative problem solving loop when you have to wait 24 hours to get your transcripts back.<p>So we’ve set our sights on building <i>the</i> speech company. Competition from companies like Google, Amazon, and Nuance is real, but none of these approach speech recognition like we do. We&#x27;ve rebuilt the entire speech processing stack, replacing heuristics and stats based speech processing with fully end-to-end deep learning (we use CNNs and RNNs). Using GPUs, we train speech models to learn customer’s unique vocabularies, accents, product names, and acoustic environments. This can be the difference between correctly capturing “wasn’t delivered” and “was in the liver.” We’ve focused on speed since we think that’s very important for exploration and scale. Our API returns hour-long transcripts interactively in seconds. It’s a tool many businesses wish they had.<p>So far we’ve released tools that:<p><pre><code>  - transcribe speech with timestamps\n  - support real-time streaming\n  - have multi-channel support\n  - understand multiple languages (in beta now)\n  - allow you to deeply search for keywords and phrases\n  - transcribe to phonemes\n  - get more accurate with use\n</code></pre>\nSome of those are better mousetraps of things you’re familiar with and some are completely new levers to pull in your audio data. We’ve built the core on English but now we’re releasing the tools for all of the Americas. (aside: You can transfer learn speech and it works well!)<p>Accuracy will continue to improve for transcription, but I think we can do more. It&#x27;s such a large problem, and we really want to make a dent in “solving speech”. That means asking, truly: “What can a human do?“<p>People can, with little context, jump into a conversation and determine:<p><pre><code>  - What are the words? When are they said? Who said what?\n  - Is this person young&#x2F;old? Male&#x2F;Female? Exhausted&#x2F;energetic?\n  - Where is there confusion?\n  - What language are they speaking? What’s the speaker’s accent?\n  - What’s the topic of the conversation? Small talk or real? Is it going well?\n</code></pre>\nSome of those things are being worked on now: additional language support, language and accent detection, sentiment analysis, auto-summarization, topic modeling, and more.<p>We’d love to hear your feedback and ideas.","time":1545156407,"title":"Launch HN: Deepgram (YC W16) – Scalable Speech API for Businesses","type":"story"},{"by":"carimura","descendants":1,"id":18708838,"kids":[18708904,18708979],"score":12,"time":1545156254,"title":"The Inevitability of Serverless","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@carimura/the-inevitability-of-serverless-5680d5c88d33"},{"by":"jterwill","descendants":2,"id":18708824,"kids":[18711051,18710373],"score":54,"time":1545156183,"title":"Spiking attractor networks","type":"story","url":"http://jackterwilliger.com/attractor-networks/"},{"by":"runesoerensen","descendants":46,"id":18708861,"kids":[18710296,18717602,18720025,18713056],"score":136,"time":1545156330,"title":"Envoy Proxy at Reddit","type":"story","url":"https://redditblog.com/2018/12/18/envoy-proxy-at-reddit/"},{"by":"mbgaxyz","descendants":2,"id":18708729,"kids":[18709395,18709410],"score":9,"time":1545155604,"title":"Bitcoin Cash Litigation “Response to Complaint” Countdown Timer","type":"story","url":"https://www.bitcoincashlitigation.com/"},{"by":"mijustin","descendants":3,"id":18708594,"kids":[18708694,18708706],"score":11,"time":1545154803,"title":"Quit asking about my pain points","type":"story","url":"https://studiofellow.com/articles/pain-points/"},{"by":"jseliger","descendants":67,"id":18708437,"kids":[18709528,18708889,18708973,18708963,18709367,18709478,18711154,18710388,18709222,18709343,18709249,18709703,18708928],"score":39,"time":1545153966,"title":"New York's Low Apartment Turnover Hinders Affordability","type":"story","url":"https://www.citylab.com/perspective/2018/12/affordable-housing-rent-regulation-turnover/578227/"},{"by":"codezero","descendants":10,"id":18708416,"kids":[18714587,18717601,18715411,18713007,18715106],"score":66,"time":1545153868,"title":"Hello, JIT World: The Joy of Simple JITs (2012)","type":"story","url":"http://blog.reverberate.org/2012/12/hello-jit-world-joy-of-simple-jits.html"},{"by":"codezero","descendants":7,"id":18708366,"kids":[18708405,18714435,18711938,18711930,18711896],"score":15,"time":1545153623,"title":"The Cult of the Bound Variable: ICFP Programming Contest (2006) [pdf]","type":"story","url":"http://boundvariable.org/press/tr-06-163.pdf"},{"by":"pseudolus","descendants":327,"id":18708356,"kids":[18709784,18708546,18708488,18708976,18709761,18708714,18711325,18709275,18709800,18708615,18709969,18709789,18710057,18710118,18709424,18711903,18710490,18710607,18709816,18709674,18711541,18710694,18708501,18710679,18712004,18710879,18708513,18708987],"score":192,"time":1545153593,"title":"Blue Apron becomes a penny stock, trading under $1 for the first time","type":"story","url":"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/blue-apron-stock-price-tumbles-below-1-first-time-2018-12-1027818501"},{"by":"Varcht","descendants":14,"id":18708360,"kids":[18710974,18708395,18711329,18709840],"score":41,"time":1545153601,"title":"Enabling Faster, More Capable Robots with Real-Time Motion Planning","type":"story","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-software/enabling-faster-more-capable-robots-with-real-time-motion-planning"},{"by":"shshhdhs","descendants":130,"id":18708221,"kids":[18709444,18709156,18709472,18709368,18711487,18709180,18709038,18709718,18709671,18709361,18709736,18711107,18715873,18710895,18709864,18711571,18709162,18709888],"score":135,"time":1545152884,"title":"Novogratz's Crypto Trading Desk Lost $136M in Nine Months","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-28/novogratz-s-crypto-trading-desk-lost-136-million-in-nine-months"},{"by":"CoreSet","descendants":9,"id":18708119,"kids":[18708347,18710380,18713880,18712320],"score":28,"text":"In September I released a small book about programming and security.

If that is truly the intended use, then I think this use differs substantially from the agree&#x2F;like and disagree&#x2F;dislike semantics that other sites use such that it merits some documentation.<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsfaq.html","time":1545083237,"title":"Ask HN: What intention are upvotes and downvotes meant to signal on HN?","type":"story"},{"by":"agronaut","descendants":60,"id":18702619,"kids":[18703542,18703006,18704945,18703288,18703565,18703593,18703337,18703272,18704906,18708738,18703310,18703009],"score":474,"time":1545083917,"title":"Neural Networks as Ordinary Differential Equations","type":"story","url":"https://rkevingibson.github.io/blog/neural-networks-as-ordinary-differential-equations/"},{"by":"icedchai","descendants":87,"id":18702495,"kids":[18702897,18703486,18703500,18703063,18715120,18703119,18703031,18702986,18703079,18703185,18702868,18702952,18703924,18703320,18702829,18703335,18713707,18703253,18702929,18703248,18703074,18707342,18703327,18703390,18703005],"score":66,"time":1545083042,"title":"Why REST Sucks","type":"story","url":"http://vmrcre.org/web/scribe/home/-/blogs/why-rest-sucks"},{"by":"newzucanuze","descendants":8,"id":18702405,"kids":[18711825,18702678,18702853,18704329,18707556,18705680,18702793],"score":14,"text":"Hello fellow freelancers of HN. One thing that I always struggle with is estimates&#x2F;quotes for large unwieldy projects. In particular, there are 2 opposing forces:<p>Force 1: Even for very well-defined projects, it&#x27;s extremely difficult to accurately predict how long a large project will take. Not to mention all the minor additions and adjustments that will be made along the way. It seems like giving a hard quote is next to impossible and the way to go is an estimate for hourly work.<p>Force 2: Charging hourly. I typically avoid charging hourly, instead giving quotes based on my internal rate of $100&#x2F;hr. Although charging hourly can be preferable, see issue 1, I feel that most clients would balk at such an hourly rate and would prefer to pay some offshore developers $30&#x2F;hr and hope for the best. On the other hand, if I quote $10,000 for a job that&#x27;s expected to take 100 hours, they will generally feel the quote is fair.<p>How do you go about quoting&#x2F;estimating large projects?","time":1545082375,"title":"Ask HN: Freelancers quoting large jobs","type":"story"},{"by":"gitgud","descendants":40,"id":18702370,"kids":[18702766,18703129,18703301,18705184,18708230,18715978,18702949,18703234,18703630,18706853,18702706,18705613,18718022,18715168,18704110,18702694,18705353,18705451,18702864,18719174,18711406],"score":38,"text":"How do you deal with the fact that you can never learn even a tiny fraction of what the world has to offer?<p>I&#x27;m either paralysed with decision  of what to spend time on or frantically trying to read as much as I can....","time":1545082091,"title":"Ask HN: How can I be happy, knowing I can never learn or read everything online?","type":"story"},{"by":"heydenberk","descendants":3,"id":18702199,"kids":[18706034,18705420],"score":8,"time":1545080567,"title":"Finite state machines as data structures (2015)","type":"story","url":"https://blog.burntsushi.net/transducers/#finite-state-machines-as-data-structures"},{"by":"taytus","descendants":97,"id":18702158,"kids":[18702413,18702496,18702627,18702830,18702710,18702441,18702598,18702647,18704787,18703101,18702613,18702691,18702478,18702484,18702468,18702446],"score":64,"time":1545080238,"title":"Bitcoin Was a Bubble and It Popped","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-12-11/yep-bitcoin-was-a-bubble-and-it-popped"},{"by":"StreamBright","descendants":30,"id":18702178,"kids":[18703132,18702731,18705005,18704554,18707771,18703551,18758466,18702814,18703155],"score":152,"time":1545080441,"title":"Lessons Learned Implementing Common Lisp with LLVM [video]","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbdXeRBbgDM"},{"by":"zarkov99","descendants":16,"id":18702110,"kids":[18704696,18702230],"score":26,"time":1545079979,"title":"Sam Harris deletes patreon account after platform boots conservatives","type":"story","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-harris-deletes-patreon-account-after-platform-boots-conservatives-2018-12"},{"by":"MagicPropmaker","dead":true,"id":18702004,"kids":[18702075,18702025],"score":2,"time":1545079416,"title":"Dr. Elon and Mr. Musk: Life Inside Tesla's Production Hell","type":"story","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-tesla-life-inside-gigafactory/#wired"},{"by":"realdlee","descendants":8,"id":18701991,"kids":[18702464,18702800,18702799],"score":16,"time":1545079325,"title":"SF to developer who tore down landmark house: Rebuild it exactly as it was","type":"story","url":"https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/City-requires-property-owner-who-demolished-13467909.php"},{"by":"krn","descendants":4,"id":18701880,"kids":[18704858,18702331,18702339],"score":9,"time":1545078548,"title":"Putin says rap music should be state guided","type":"story","url":"https://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2018/12/17/vladimir-putin-rap-music-guided-state-pleitgen-sot-vpx.cnn"},{"by":"brunoluiz","descendants":12,"id":18701916,"kids":[18704603,18704618,18702346,18703298,18705258,18702340],"score":105,"time":1545078918,"title":"BloomRPC: GUI Client for GRPC Services","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/uw-labs/bloomrpc"},{"by":"shadowfaxRodeo","descendants":165,"id":18701772,"kids":[18701928,18705229,18701932,18702040,18702077,18701977,18702128,18701856,18701929,18701930,18702051,18701951,18702056,18701984,18702127,18702180,18701926,18701927,18702094,18705669,18704800,18701937,18702177,18701924,18701965,18702409,18702344,18702095,18705694,18705628,18702278,18701983,18702135,18702038,18701936,18701922,18701935,18701915,18702152,18701988,18702179,18701933,18701925,18704019,18701993,18702251,18702046],"score":247,"time":1545077652,"title":"Show HN: Fancy fonts you can use almost anywhere","type":"story","url":"https://beautifuldingbats.com/hey-howd-you-do-that"},{"by":"apollinaire","descendants":25,"id":18701701,"kids":[18706093,18705975,18706950,18705904,18706520,18705455,18710813,18705710],"score":56,"time":1545077100,"title":"Damn It All: The Penguin Book of Hell","type":"story","url":"https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2018/12/20/damn-it-all-book-of-hell/"},{"by":"tareqak","descendants":145,"id":18701601,"kids":[18703356,18703485,18703333,18706099,18701803,18703772,18706578,18703358,18706104,18701946,18704096,18703084,18703026,18704417],"score":188,"time":1545076464,"title":"NAACP returns Facebook donation, calls for boycott on Tuesday","type":"story","url":"https://www.axios.com/naacp-returns-facebook-donation-calls-for-boycott-c60ef129-457d-4847-80e3-1d7fdb5764dc.html"},{"by":"frnkshin","descendants":3,"id":18701554,"kids":[18705434,18705497,18701808],"score":1,"text":"This might be irrelevant to HN, but...<p>I recently got a gift code worth $150 on Amazon.com.<p>Are there anything that&#x27;s absolutely necessary to spend this on Amazon?

guys,<p>I&#x27;m a mid-twenties software engineer who plays a lot of video games in my spare time. Games of choice are mostly FPS titles (e.g. Overwatch, CS:GO) and I tend to be competitive when I play. In case it&#x27;s relevant, I also have a particularly vicious case of ADHD.<p>The nature of the games I play make a headset effectively mandatory, as sound cues are particularly important. That being the case, I&#x27;ve noticed that, for some reason that I can&#x27;t pin down, I tend to perform better overall in-game when I&#x27;m not wearing a headset. Specifically, when I don&#x27;t wear a headset, I:<p>- Auto-pilot less (I think more about my objectives, how I want to execute, and what I&#x27;m doing in general)\n- Tense up less during &quot;stressful situations&quot; (I&#x27;m generally overall calmer)\n- Seem to aim&#x2F;track targets better (likely a result of the above; my mouse arm is more relaxed)\n- Am overall more focused\n- Simply win more games<p>As a result, I frequently opt to put my headset around my neck and simply turn up the volume, however this is far from ideal.<p>Why would just wearing a headset impact my performance? Is this a known problem?<p>At first I thought it was a comfort thing, and tried other headsets to no avail. I&#x27;m now leaning towards it being psychological (sound makes the experience more immersive, the increased immersion makes the &quot;virtually stressful&quot; situations actually stressful, and the increased stress impedes my higher-level thinking), however that&#x27;s just baseless intuition on my part.<p>I&#x27;d really appreciate any insights any of you have. :)","time":1545017387,"title":"Ask HN: Why do I perform better in video games when I don't wear a headset?","type":"story"},{"by":"entelechy","descendants":2,"id":18696718,"kids":[18697709,18697719,18697020],"score":3,"text":"What should I do if my government doesn&#x27;t handle my data in accordance to GDPR?<p>Furthermore, when is it possible to exercise &quot;the right to be forgotten&quot;?","time":1545017117,"title":"Ask HN: What to do if a Government is not GDPR compliant?","type":"story"},{"by":"Element_","descendants":93,"id":18696664,"kids":[18697094,18697420,18697545,18697662,18697575,18697315,18696967,18697174,18697448,18697293,18697340],"score":74,"time":1545016209,"title":"Netflix’s Movie Blitz Takes Aim at Hollywood’s Heart","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/16/business/media/netflix-movies-hollywood.html"},{"by":"acob","descendants":5,"id":18696661,"kids":[18696695,18696685,18696843,18696820,18698964,18696761],"score":2,"time":1545016134,"title":"Ask HN: You $10,000 to Invest into 1 CryptoCurrency, What would it be?","type":"story"},{"by":"bcantrill","descendants":87,"id":18696649,"kids":[18697350,18698681,18697076,18698636,18697298,18697360,18699106,18697739,18699414,18699996,18697880,18697078,18697358,18698768,18697505,18697333],"score":205,"time":1545015905,"title":"A EULA in FOSS clothing?","type":"story","url":"http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/2018/12/16/a-eula-in-foss-clothing/"},{"by":"chirau","descendants":2,"id":18697054,"kids":[18698363,18697175],"score":3,"text":"I have a few niche markets where I think there is an opportunity for entrepreneurs to create Bloombergs, Capital IQs, FactSets or even CrunchBase or CB Insights like offerings.<p>I just have no idea what is involved in such a business.

It may seem that society has come a long way to preserving and protecting the human race. Yet, after less than fifteen thousand years as a civilization, we are just as much at risk of extinction.<p>In the twenty-first century, we are force-fed the ideology of the enlightened human. We are taught that with freedom, liberty, and justice — all nicely tied up in the gift of democracy  — humans can create a paradise on Earth, an environment that allows the human spirit to thrive. In this worldview, the human collective prospers when each one of us is given a voice. The human race survives because the collective is responsible for its survival.<p>Unfortunately, this is a lie. Democracy was supposed to save us from the evils of tyranny. It was supposed to ensure our survival by creating stability and equality. Yet, it too is cursed by short-sightedness.<p>This leads to a claim that has already been repeated over and over again: human government has never worked and will never work when it comes to optimizing for long-term survival.<p>In turn, our only fighting chance comes when we choose to fight for the future. And the only way to do that is to remove humans from power.The only practical way to do this is to put computers in charge of our governments.<p>This concept, termed the Singleton, is tainted by hyperbole. If you talk to any expert out there, you will usually be met with one response - put artificial intelligence in charge of our governments, and humanity faces extinction.<p>We believe otherwise.

It has a certain magical quality to it, but I really want it to be enjoyable reading for everyone. I would also like to use it as a platform to explain STEM concepts(I am from the bookshelf encyclopedia generation with giant illustrations). So far, I have little stories (less than 5000 words) that includes ‘human concepts’ like how to a stock taking of a pantry(sorry..I started out as an accountant. That’s what grabbed me first as subject), an enchanted nestery run by a pigeon who puts magical spells on birds nests to illustrate different kinds of nests and eggs of various birds, a Beauty Salon for insects whose markings fade...again, to illustrate markings on ladybugs, butterflies and cleaning bee pollen baskets etc. It’s turning out to be more of a picture book. I would like to introduce subjects that teach something of the natural world and the physics in it. My favourite has always been time and the uni directional arrow of time. I also want to write a story that explains why we are carbon based life forms. About the night skies. Also..photosynthesis, on soil biology, migration, hibernation etc are easy to include in a farm setting.

Should I expect a significant performance hit if I do end up encrypting the drive?<p>Right now I&#x27;m just using the laptop for office work, but I plan on heading back to school in the near term and probably should worry about theft.","time":1544805698,"title":"Ask HN: Do you encrypt your laptop's SSD/hard drive?","type":"story"},{"by":"jeffreyrogers","dead":true,"id":18682047,"kids":[18682682,18682709],"score":12,"time":1544805164,"title":"Donald Trump Is a Good President","type":"story","url":"https://harpers.org/archive/2019/01/donald-trump-is-a-good-president/"},{"by":"ciconia","descendants":3,"id":18681930,"kids":[18689468,18687518,18687405],"score":35,"time":1544804496,"title":"Yanis Varoufakis: My plan for Europe can succeed where Macron and Piketty failed","type":"story","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/13/plan-europe-macron-piketty-green-new-deal-britain"},{"by":"giacaglia","descendants":15,"id":18681847,"kids":[18683898,18683925,18683658,18683445,18684933],"score":176,"time":1544804041,"title":"How AI Training Scales","type":"story","url":"https://blog.openai.com/science-of-ai/"},{"by":"chrisseldo","descendants":260,"id":18681772,"kids":[18682962,18684188,18681968,18682203,18683812,18683048,18682135,18685917,18681976,18683549,18682210,18684179,18685325,18682104,18682332,18683443,18681862,18682694,18686666,18682533,18684228,18681909,18683826,18683426,18682339,18682605,18689792,18683657,18687573,18682038,18682859,18684361,18682873,18687028,18682525,18682646,18683084,18683228],"score":512,"time":1544803633,"title":"Facebook says new bug allowed apps access to private photos of up to 6.8M users","type":"story","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/12/14/facebook-says-new-bug-allowed-apps-access-private-photos-up-million-users/"},{"by":"Ivoah","descendants":21,"id":18681745,"kids":[18690181,18684557,18689094,18688389,18688597,18691176],"score":113,"time":1544803473,"title":"Incrementally improving the performance of a Python script","type":"story","url":"http://mycode.doesnot.run/2018/04/11/pivot/"},{"by":"jwally","descendants":13,"id":18681757,"kids":[18681959,18687789,18683934,18682002,18687543,18687713,18698022,18682069,18682705,18682764,18683114],"score":9,"text":"I’m going back and forth with my father in law about whether or not free will exists (beats talking about politics) and I stumbled into an idea and was curious if it made sense.<p>I’m supposing that all events are the result of a train of consequences (determinism) or are completely random (quantum stuff).

I think i need something a bit more rigid, like a set of tasks and examples for that on how to do it.<p>Is there any tool, process, formal way, that can help me through this?\nI don&#x27;t mind paying for some product or course if it really adds some value. :)<p>Anything? :) Thanks &lt;3","time":1544545039,"title":"Ask HN: Being afraid and not knowing how to start building a startup concept","type":"story"},{"by":"kalendos","descendants":4,"id":18656227,"kids":[18656552,18664820,18663912],"score":12,"time":1544544384,"title":"Announcing GitLab Serverless","type":"story","url":"https://about.gitlab.com/2018/12/11/introducing-gitlab-serverless/"},{"by":"colinprince","descendants":19,"id":18656130,"kids":[18656594,18656448,18659057,18658454],"score":71,"time":1544543749,"title":"Ex-Canadian Diplomat Michael Kovrig Detained in China","type":"story","url":"https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/kovrig-detained-china-tuesday-1.4940725"},{"by":"lebronlee","descendants":4,"id":18656158,"kids":[18656192,18656185,18656323],"score":2,"text":"We are doing similar work.

Maybe Chinese Keynesian &quot;animal spirit&quot; exceeds that of the West-- greater raw, supply-side entrepreneurial drive, leading to faster experiments and better products.<p>3. Maybe China has more competition, and hyper-competition (competition within similar strategies) than the West, yielding greater competitive pressures driving product innovation.<p>4. The a16z article describes Chinese product innovations that are often network-based. Maybe Chinese society is more communal, yielding greater opportunity for network-based products.<p>5. Maybe Chinese consumers exhibit greater product switching behavior; they are more willing to try a new product vs. settling with a current choice. They are less satisfied with &quot;good enough&quot;, leading to greater product innovation due to retention pressure. In the West, young people exhibit greater product switching behavior, and this trait declines with age. Maybe China has more young people than the West, as opposed to greater intrinsic switching behavior.<p>6. Maybe the greater sophistication&#x2F;diversity of Chinese products is baseline macroeconomics: paraphrasing Adam Smith, &quot;specialization is limited by the extent of the trade network&quot;. Larger trade networks have better stuff of the same type, cheaper stuff of the same type, and new types of stuff. Maybe China&#x27;s domestic market is so large that their products are naturally of greater variance, including the variance of sophistication and revenue diversity.","time":1544479222,"title":"Ask HN: [from a16z article] Why are Chinese business models more sophisticated?","type":"story"},{"by":"buf","descendants":16,"id":18651689,"kids":[18652490,18651749,18653885,18652683,18652666,18652340,18653463,18660150,18665656,18652132,18654657],"score":24,"text":"Long time Rails&#x2F;Django&#x2F;Express user here.

One group developed code using TDD while the other a waterfall-like approach. Both groups developed a small Java program. We found that the TDD developers produced higher quality code, which passed 18% more functional black box test cases.

That means &gt; 50% of the time, said entities use TDD for some code base. And I would like this to be somewhat verifiable and well documented - not just some person on Quora saying &quot;Some How Yes !!! All major products are following TDD, And if few are not following then they are probably busy to create unit cases&#x2F;integration tests for existing code and want to  adapt TDD in near future as soon as possible !&quot;<p>With TDD I mean:<p>- From Kent Beck: Never write a single line of code unless you have a failing automated test. Eliminate duplication.<p>- From Wikipedia: 1. Add a test, 2. Run all tests and see if the new test fails, 3. Write the code, 4. Run tests, 5.

Somehow they still haven&#x27;t cut me off and they are still serving the static images.<p>I tweeted Cloudinary if there&#x27;s a way to bulk resize images, but no response yet.<p>They will probably pull the plug on me eventually unless I pay $99&#x2F;m for their service, which wouldn&#x27;t make any business sense, considering I&#x27;m not making any money off this site.<p>Anyone else got ideas on how I can potentially monetise to at least pay for my hosting and servers?<p>(I added a &quot;sponsor&quot; button to see if I can get a reaction)","time":1544414839,"title":"How to Monetize Maker Blogs to at least $99/m","type":"story"},{"by":"sytelus","descendants":61,"id":18645109,"kids":[18646232,18646464,18646359,18646472,18648321,18647632,18649037,18648145,18647065,18646429,18648317],"score":188,"time":1544414792,"title":"AlphaFold at CASP13: What just happened?","type":"story","url":"https://moalquraishi.wordpress.com/2018/12/09/alphafold-casp13-what-just-happened/"},{"by":"beltex","descendants":19,"id":18644905,"kids":[18644915,18645957,18646021,18646056,18648216,18648734],"score":82,"time":1544411851,"title":"XNU target config for Raspberry Pi 3 (2016)","type":"story","url":"https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-4903.221.2/pexpert/pexpert/arm64/BCM2837.h.auto.html"},{"by":"alexanderdmitri","descendants":7,"id":18644939,"kids":[18649664,18646978],"score":17,"time":1544412206,"title":"How big philanthropy undermines democracy (2013)","type":"story","url":"https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/plutocrats-at-work-how-big-philanthropy-undermines-democracy"},{"by":"walterbell","descendants":72,"id":18644862,"kids":[18645547,18644958,18646146,18645153,18645652,18645273,18647552,18645148,18645126,18660635],"score":81,"time":1544411050,"title":"South Korean law to punish boosters passes in the National Assembly","type":"story","url":"https://dotesports.com/overwatch/news/south-korean-law-to-punish-boosters-passes-in-the-national-assembly"},{"by":"polm23","descendants":64,"id":18644857,"kids":[18646301,18648665,18647811,18649099,18649039,18649186,18649629,18648740,18651033,18646759,18648984,18647379],"score":132,"time":1544411009,"title":"The -a to -z of Command-Line Options (2003)","type":"story","url":"http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch10s05.html"},{"by":"wglb","descendants":7,"id":18644835,"kids":[18648870,18647962,18647843,18647850,18648070],"score":44,"time":1544410499,"title":"500-Year-Old Body of Man Wearing Thigh-High Boots Found in London Sewer Build","type":"story","url":"https://www.livescience.com/64239-thames-skeleton-with-boots-discovered.html"},{"by":"ph33r","descendants":5,"id":18644735,"kids":[18645578,18650450,18645454,18644973,18654565,18654969],"score":5,"text":"torproject.org has a section called &#x27;Who Uses Tor?&#x27; and lists: Friends and Family, Businesses, Activists, Media, etc.<p>None of my IT colleagues use it, my family certainly doesn&#x27;t use it, and two guys I know who work in the NetSec field don&#x27;t bother with it.

Obviously this is a question for an accountant who knows my situation but this is only a starting point for gathering information to help make my decision, I&#x27;m sure someone on HN has been in a similar situation.<p>Any help&#x2F;advice&#x2F;thoughts are greatly appreciated!<p>Thanks HN.","time":1544198131,"title":"Ask HN: Should I open a business entity to be paid by US company?","type":"story"},{"by":"basicplus2","dead":true,"id":18628422,"kids":[18628839,18628803],"score":10,"time":1544196510,"title":"Doctors Aren’t Sure How This Even Came Out of a Patient","type":"story","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/12/bronchial-blood-clot/577480/"},{"by":"NinjaX","descendants":3,"id":18628293,"kids":[18642354,18628391],"score":7,"time":1544195714,"title":"Ask HN: What are the best courses for online marketing?","type":"story"},{"by":"wofo","descendants":118,"id":18628295,"kids":[18628668,18628421,18633657,18628510,18629848,18628518,18630823,18630129,18628675,18628791,18629782],"score":272,"time":1544195723,"title":"Nginx on Wasmjit","type":"story","url":"https://www.wasmjit.org/blog/nginx-on-wasmjit.html"},{"by":"camtarn","descendants":135,"id":18628325,"kids":[18628931,18628723,18629248,18628655,18628711,18628721,18629519,18630086,18630104,18628709,18629731,18629001,18628700,18628837,18629304,18629070,18628867,18628716],"score":66,"time":1544195938,"title":"Tesla Autopilot and Euro NCAP","type":"story","url":"https://www.autoevolution.com/news/the-trashing-of-tesla-autopilot-by-euro-ncap-129683.html"},{"by":"algorithmsRcool","descendants":8,"id":18628166,"kids":[18675027,18658238,18628330,18628550],"score":24,"time":1544194783,"title":"Ambrosia: Robust Distributed Programming Made Easy and Efficient","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/AMBROSIA"},{"by":"deepaksurti","descendants":361,"id":18628140,"kids":[18629075,18628785,18628547,18629716,18628572,18629996,18628432,18628453,18629821,18632756,18628801,18629721,18631053,18628715,18628495,18628887,18628919,18628427,18629221,18629638,18628576,18628693,18630425,18629719,18628418,18628775,18628923,18628585,18631499,18628452,18628718,18629901,18629208,18633353,18631192,18628728,18628679,18629278,18632800,18628663,18628894,18629859,18631792,18629827,18628605,18629630,18634606,18629905,18629189,18633318,18628490,18629485,18629127,18630103,18634071,18629087,18630072,18629633,18632284,18630565,18629564,18628608,18628634,18629775,18628443],"score":522,"time":1544194601,"title":"They Rejected Us","type":"story","url":"https://rejected.us"},{"by":"Nuance","descendants":103,"id":18628059,"kids":[18631148,18630897,18642411,18629909,18630319,18632164,18635494,18630291,18629499,18632704,18630855,18632476,18629671,18630599],"score":233,"time":1544194045,"title":"Stories of Steve Jobs in Safari Design Reviews (2014)","type":"story","url":"https://donmelton.com/2014/04/10/memories-of-steve/"},{"by":"benwr","descendants":82,"id":18628072,"kids":[18630486,18628089,18630348,18630460,18631160,18629846,18633709,18630514,18634072,18630140,18630935,18633132],"score":115,"time":1544194127,"title":"No, negative masses have not revolutionized cosmology","type":"story","url":"http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2018/12/no-negative-masses-have-not.html"},{"by":"pseudolus","descendants":101,"id":18627683,"kids":[18631267,18631721,18632097,18631853,18631215,18652053,18630849,18633158,18635013,18630989,18630673],"score":248,"time":1544191421,"title":"Viral hepatitis: A silent epidemic killing more people than HIV, malaria or TB","type":"story","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07592-7"},{"by":"break_the_bank","descendants":199,"id":18627530,"kids":[18628681,18628165,18629567,18627784,18628009,18627979,18628046,18628940,18629601,18628938,18628872,18628131,18631574,18628134,18627977,18628531,18629778,18628360,18632876,18628459,18629234,18632993,18628737,18628761,18627783,18637077,18632038,18633501,18631367,18628374,18627975,18629531,18627790,18632082,18628151,18638758,18628377,18629667,18628806,18628240,18628076,18629120,18628124,18628028,18630583,18627893,18635589,18628470,18631719,18632871,18629285,18627835,18627915,18629954,18629507,18633055,18627894,18629807,18629799,18627952,18628953,18627802,18632834,18627756,18629210,18628901,18632381,18628304,18629958,18634238,18629887,18627770,18628099,18638002,18632183,18634828,18628922,18628341,18627916,18629983,18629789,18630157,18629220,18628876,18627759,18627765,18628159],"score":402,"text":"Like a lot of you I have mostly worked in back-end or systems software.

I was paid just slightly more than my time as a junior dev, and usually put projects that had clients that didn&#x27;t interact with the other employees beside myself and the PM. It was very silo&#x27;d in. Pretty much, do the work that their regular employees don&#x27;t have time for.<p>During this time they had already moved into their own dedicated office. There are still a lot of kinks in the armor but at least things feel more organized in the company. Local dev team is still barebones with the management largely directing off-shore workers. And then I started thinking, if this is 3 years of growth I wonder what is the next step to take this business to the next level.<p>Do agencies form some proprietary tech that make them attractive for large co&#x27;s to pick it up and buy them? Is that a general case? I am not thinking of starting a business, but I don&#x27;t see if there&#x27;s, if any, way to properly scale up to a national level. Is the agency model just inherently restricted to scaling? Could they expand their vision and scale up?","time":1544138849,"title":"Ask HN: Are web/marketing agencies inherently difficult to scale?","type":"story"},{"by":"woogiewonka","descendants":6,"id":18623552,"kids":[18623657,18634492,18623828],"score":4,"text":"I&#x27;m looking to organize all of my life&#x27;s information into a single dashboard - things like financial, health, goals and progress information.

I can&#x27;t find a modern device that&#x27;s usable for me.<p>I suspect that some kind of flickering, like temporal dithering, is the root cause. Does anyone know if Android phones are using temporal dithering or some other kind of flicker?<p>I&#x27;m aware of PWM flicker in OLED displays, but that seems to not be my problem, since Galaxy S5 is OLED, and it works great for me. I&#x27;ve been to several doctors (MDs), optometrists, opthamologists and neurologists -- and they&#x27;ve all declared me healthy. Clearly something is different about these newer devices that are causing this issue, since when I return to my Galaxy S5, my symptoms will go away. Certainly, there&#x27;s something different about me, but modern medicine has no answers.

I&#x27;m newer to HN, but I know this is the place to reach out and find the person I&#x27;m looking for. I’m indebted for your help.<p>TL;DR<p>I’m an expert strategist with experience in media tech who’s looking for a technical co-founder to help grow a social enterprise that aims to combat the negative effects of climate change by helping people switch to clean energy sources now... and make making other changes that lessen the effects of climate change easy for people in time. I currently have an MVP but would like to partner with a developer to take it to the next level. If you’re passionate about using your skills to help combat the negative effects of climate change, please PM me.<p>Background<p>I never gave any thought to climate change -- that is before I read the most-read article in the 50-year history of New York Magazine, that basically says the Earth’s good through the end of the century and that&#x27;s it because of climate change -- and watched a series of funny but substantive videos about climate change on Funny or Die on back-to-back days during the Summer of 2016. I have three young kids, and the possibility of the planet&#x27;s having catastrophic problems in their lifetimes meant that... there was no way I was going to sit around and not try to do something about it.<p>Conversion to renewable energy is one area that can lessen the effects of climate change, and while that&#x27;s where I&#x27;ve focused to date and where I&#x27;ve developed a few ways to convert people from standard to renewable energy at scale, my plan is to identify several areas that could lessen the effects of climate change and develop ways to make things easy for individuals to make other important changes. That said, there are significant opportunities to do great work in renewable energy alone.<p>And you can read more at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indiehackers.com&#x2F;forum&#x2F;seeking-tech-co-founder-whos-passionate-about-combatting-climate-change-and-saving-the-planet-aff0c0305a","time":1544034210,"title":"Seeking Technical Co-Founder to Combat Climate Change and Save the Planet","type":"story"},{"by":"rbanffy","descendants":215,"id":18610745,"kids":[18611014,18611055,18613609,18611307,18611127,18611080,18613222,18616347,18614747,18611021,18614669,18612578,18611943,18611286,18611976],"score":166,"time":1544033060,"title":"Seagate Announces 16TB HDD","type":"story","url":"https://nexthive.com/seagate-biggest-hdd-16-tb/"},{"by":"phaser","descendants":4,"id":18610764,"kids":[18610881,18610984],"score":4,"time":1544033136,"title":"Ethereum cryptocollectible game to be launched on Steam","type":"story","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/838240/Darkwinds/?beta=0"},{"by":"rayvy","descendants":8,"id":18610734,"kids":[18611646,18616804,18626455,18611130],"score":13,"text":"I have technical skills (e.g., programming languages, frameworks, platforms, etc), and I have non-technical skills (e.g., product management, leadership, communication, etc).<p>How do I list these skills on my resumé in a poignant, informative, yet to-the-point way?<p>Previously I had just gone with some sort of comma-delimited list, but there has to be a better&#x2F;more creative way than that right?","time":1544032990,"title":"Ask HN: Best way to list skills on my resumé?","type":"story"},{"by":"swoophoop","descendants":2,"id":18610733,"kids":[18612691,18610779],"score":1,"text":"I&#x27;ve been a front end developer for the last 4 years ever since leaving university, working for companies using C#, WPF and Silverlight.

I&#x27;ve ran the obvious measures (changing passwords, locking content etc) and taught them the basics about how the www works and security etc. But not only the hacking continues (even with new passwords and 2FA) but now it is appearing in a new form: they simply clone the profile with public photo and name and starts a new conversation. It is even worse in Instagram since: 1 - they don&#x27;t usually message there so there is no older conversation not appearing 2 - there is not the concept of friends, just followers.<p>I&#x27;ve gone to the police multiple times by now, since they cannot explain to the officers what is happening. Using the bank account provided by the hacker they found some guys, but apparently these guys were hacked too and the hacker(s) is(are) using their account as a proxy.<p>I don&#x27;t know what to do, really.

Even though most of the people seemed nice enough and ready to work at a startup, they failed even the basic coding puzzles.<p>Now, since the first 10 candidates&#x27;s levels were pretty low. I have simplified the coding puzzles to the point that my first question is: &quot;Given &#x27;n&#x27; a natural number, can you write a method that returns the sum of numbers from 1 to n?&quot;. Almost every person out of the next 20 interviews failed this question.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t mind training a junior or taking an intern if he has the foundations covered.

In my mind, I wonder how you can do your job without knowing how to write a &quot;for&quot; loop. The questions just test that the candidate has a good grasp on data structures, they are not at all complicated for someone that actually does coding. I guide them through the puzzles that they get stuck at (mind you, most get stuck at the sum test) with helping questions. If they fail the test, I tell them on what to improve upon if they want to have another go at the interview (no candidates returned for a second interview).<p>I&#x27;m not going to get discouraged and keep searching, but how do I manage the expectations when interviewing in a small city?","time":1543912032,"title":"Ask HN: How to manage expectations in finding talent in a small city?","type":"story"},{"by":"edejong","descendants":1,"id":18597396,"kids":[18597554,18611562],"score":9,"time":1543911388,"title":"First critical Kubernetes security hole discovered","type":"story","url":"https://www.zdnet.com/article/kubernetes-first-major-security-hole-discovered/"},{"by":"pmcpinto","descendants":76,"id":18597305,"kids":[18598227,18598190,18598244,18598336,18599897,18598354,18600132,18606687,18599287,18598924,18598732,18599675,18598716,18602842,18598238,18598563,18603734,18598840,18598647],"score":108,"time":1543910557,"title":"The popularity of the Squatty Potty","type":"story","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/nov/30/bowel-movement-change-the-way-you-poo-squatty-potty-toilet"},{"by":"samclemens","descendants":12,"id":18597146,"kids":[18601752,18602553],"score":51,"time":1543908857,"title":"Built to Last: John McPhee's Way of Seeing","type":"story","url":"https://www.bookforum.com/inprint/025_04/20435"},{"by":"guimonz","descendants":3,"id":18597003,"kids":[18597297,18597183],"score":1,"time":1543906939,"title":"Little things that matter in a software engineering interview","type":"story","url":"https://link.medium.com/Mdp0vxJOmS"},{"by":"qzervaas","descendants":3,"id":18596976,"kids":[18599407,18598240,18598810],"score":15,"time":1543906600,"title":"Anti-encryption bill: Labor and Coalition agree to encryption “compromise”","type":"story","url":"https://www.itnews.com.au/news/labor-and-coalition-agree-to-encryption-compromise-516489"},{"by":"steph-newton","descendants":12,"id":18596945,"kids":[18597882,18598583,18597052,18605626,18597602],"score":20,"time":1543906173,"title":"Ripley: Project management tool for G Suite","type":"story","url":"https://ripleyhq.com/"},{"by":"skellertor","descendants":27,"id":18596988,"kids":[18597985,18598097,18601119,18597255,18597352,18598409,18599583,18598939,18600590,18599087,18600672,18600350,18599383,18597807],"score":98,"time":1543906727,"title":"Yak shaving and fixing","type":"story","url":"https://sophiebits.com/2018/12/03/yak-shaving-fixing.html"},{"by":"deafcalculus","descendants":125,"id":18596841,"kids":[18598912,18599909,18596955,18600154,18604194,18597671,18598232,18599142,18598573,18598427,18603098,18597381,18600264,18597281],"score":309,"time":1543904591,"title":"A Not-Called Function Can Cause a 5X Slowdown","type":"story","url":"https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2018/12/03/a-not-called-function-can-cause-a-5x-slowdown/"},{"by":"prostoalex","descendants":7,"id":18596837,"kids":[18599524,18601833,18597849,18602326],"score":57,"time":1543904539,"title":"Reliable Webhooks Using Serverless Architecture","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/square-corner-blog/reliable-webhooks-using-serverless-architecture-e009a2096732"},{"by":"prostoalex","descendants":104,"id":18596802,"kids":[18605679,18605323,18607435,18607627,18605494,18606665,18605746,18606660,18605366,18619950,18608079,18606865,18605741,18605331,18605290],"score":131,"time":1543904068,"title":"The new word processor wars: A fresh crop of productivity apps","type":"story","url":"https://www.geekwire.com/2018/new-word-processor-wars-fresh-crop-productivity-apps-trying-reinvent-workday/"},{"by":"prostoalex","dead":true,"id":18596797,"kids":[18596986,18596809],"score":1,"time":1543904033,"title":"The Friendship That Made Google Huge","type":"story","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/10/the-friendship-that-made-google-huge/amp"},{"by":"mangesh","descendants":4,"id":18596712,"kids":[18596857,18599568,18607064],"score":4,"time":1543902861,"title":"SHOW HN: Increase your revenue and sales instantly, Fix your website","type":"story","url":"https://www.uxreview.co"},{"by":"oldgradstudent","descendants":43,"id":18596667,"kids":[18597267,18598078,18597576,18598661,18597631,18597832,18597598,18597293,18597696,18602300,18599417,18597276,18597315,18597990,18598237,18599555,18605221,18599336,18597366],"score":70,"time":1543902505,"title":"Amazon Promised Drone Delivery in Five Years Five Years Ago","type":"story","url":"https://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/amazon-promised-drone-delivery-in-five-years-five-ye-1830818625"},{"by":"ttty2","descendants":5,"id":18596463,"kids":[18596652,18596495],"score":12,"text":"In the future, I think we will need to make a full background check like when you apply for a credit card to use any service.

My Salary is quiet decent and i have a lot of fun at work.\nAlthough i like my work, i wouldn&#x27;t work for free or like to work during the weekends, in fact, i would love to work less than 42 hours. I thought Computers and AI would make us work less, but it is quiet the opposite. But that is a different topic.\nI make around 6000 USD and pay around 2000 USD for rent. This is one third of my salary. It annoys me. And there is no way out.<p>Here are some questions that pop up in my mind:<p>1. There is so much money involved in this, why is there no innovation, like building cheap housing on masse?<p>2. Ikea made a fortune by making furniture really cheap. Why is there no &quot;ikea&quot; for housing? What is so difficult about housing that makes it impossible to automate?<p>3. In this day and age: why are people still living in metropolitan areas? The obvious answer is of course: because the jobs are there. But software engineers can work from anywhere? Why not pick a cheap area and build a new city there?\nThe chinese people are building new &quot;mega&quot; cities. It seems : in western part of the world. Creating a new city is not an option. Instead the existing cities grow.

I also use the term collector because while I average holding ~150 domains at any given time (including my prized possession, e.ht), I rarely set them up to be exposed on a potential market. Anyone who has shown interest in a domain did the dirty work of figuring out how to reach out to me.  This has worked out and I&#x27;ve actually sold quite a few to some noteworthy groups. For example, the Mormon church sent a broker after LDSMatch.com, and i was able to have a great ROI on a domain that cost me a handful of years worth of ICANN fees.<p>Fast forward to today. I have a domain that is currently being chased by a Godaddy broker representing a client. It&#x27;s a good domain, consisting of two words and a .com. My intentions before I read about the covers.com sale were to accept the second offer (I typically ignore the first fishing offers), but woke up this morning and changed my email draft.

The dark circle has never left me; in fact, it&#x27;s now been joined by a transparent, shimmering circle.<p>I&#x27;m not worried about going blind based on the doctor&#x27;s opinion, but I am concerned that I will have to deal with long-term vision issues.  Currently, I cannot read the text on my screen if I close my right eye, as the dark circle gets in the way of everything.<p>It left me with an interesting question.  I&#x27;d read about blind people working as developers and sysadmins before.  But I never really thought about it, because my vision was so good.  I&#x27;m curious now, depending on how bad my eyes get, how would I transition so that I&#x27;d be able to continue my chosen profession?  Are there blind developers and sysadmins here who can toss a few resources my way?<p>Much appreciated to the HN community in advance, thanks.  I&#x27;m currently based in Asia, so about to sleep soon, hopefully I&#x27;ll wake up with a big load of comments to read.  ;)","time":1543074338,"title":"Ask HN: Resources for blind developers and sysadmins?","type":"story"},{"by":"mridulv09","descendants":2,"id":18522392,"kids":[18522460,18522410],"score":1,"text":"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;miuv.blog&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;24&#x2F;could-there-be-a-data-loss-in-dram-while-my-system-is-up&#x2F;<p>Recently I was reading some article.

(Of course, provided it addresses your security concerns, keeps data encrypted, and take measures to ensure enough backups and everything) would you pay for your data to be moved to your own cloud rather than being distributed like it is today?","time":1543050910,"title":"Ask HN: Would you pay to keep all your data on one cloud?","type":"story"},{"by":"humanetech","descendants":90,"id":18521200,"kids":[18524751,18523210,18524418,18524028,18521510,18526723,18524668],"score":199,"time":1543050694,"title":"How my sexual health searches ended up in the hands of big tech companies","type":"story","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-11-23/health-data-shared-with-tech-companies/10521456"},{"by":"keiferski","descendants":43,"id":18521330,"kids":[18527442,18526361,18527483,18526668,18526274,18528624,18530228,18521381,18528653],"score":61,"time":1543053966,"title":"The Mystery of S., a Man with an Impossible Memory (2017)","type":"story","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-mystery-of-s-the-man-with-an-impossible-memory"},{"by":"fagnerbrack","descendants":19,"id":18521179,"kids":[18521560,18521814,18522890,18521410,18521575,18522405,18521429,18521496,18522241],"score":45,"time":1543050251,"title":"The Most Important Non-Programming Skills for Programmers","type":"story","url":"https://dev.to/aspittel/the-most-important-non-programming-skills-for-programmers-iii"},{"by":"patelmiteshb","descendants":24,"id":18521176,"kids":[18521342,18521315,18521370,18521366],"score":29,"time":1543050191,"title":"Things Every Learner Needs to Know About Effective Learning","type":"story","url":"https://thestempedia.com/blog/things-every-learner-needs-to-know-about-effective-learning/"},{"by":"catchmeifyoucan","descendants":22,"id":18521141,"kids":[18525725,18525838,18527514,18525850,18526088,18527401,18527871,18526577,18526585,18527593,18525830],"score":77,"time":1543049397,"title":"Show HN: Scatterstocks – visualize the impact of news on stock prices","type":"story","url":"https://scatterstocks.com/index.html?symbols=AAPL,GOOGL,DVMT,MSFT,AMZN&events=QXBwbGUgVW52ZWlscyBOZXcgaVBhZCBhbmQgTWFjQm9vayBBaXItMTAvMzAvMjAxOEAhQFN0b2NrcyBEaXZlIEFmdGVyIEFwcGxlIFN1cHBsaWVyIFNsYXNoZXMgT3V0bG9vay0xMS8xMi8yMDE4QCFAR29vZ2xlIFdvcmtlcnMgUmVqZWN0IFNpbGljb24gVmFsbGV5IEluZGl2aWR1YWxpc20gaW4gV2Fsa291dC0xMS8wNi8yMDE4QCFA"},{"by":"imartin2k","descendants":110,"id":18521108,"kids":[18521439,18521341,18521545,18521297,18521412,18521979,18521359,18521736,18521414,18521246,18521730,18521995,18521247],"score":132,"time":1543048725,"title":"Major AI conference is moving to Africa in 2020 due to visa issues","type":"story","url":"https://venturebeat.com/2018/11/19/major-ai-conference-is-moving-to-africa-in-2020-due-to-visa-issues/"},{"by":"peter_d_sherman","descendants":3,"id":18521085,"kids":[18521319,18521113,18521157,18521151],"score":12,"time":1543048206,"title":"SMIs are Eeeevil (2005)","type":"story","url":"https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/carmencr/2005/08/31/smis-are-eeeevil-part-1/"},{"by":"bobblywobbles","descendants":64,"id":18521030,"kids":[18522269,18522846,18521787,18521906,18521872,18522758],"score":31,"time":1543047135,"title":"Automatically minifying .cshtml files in .NET Core","type":"story","url":"https://debugandrelease.blogspot.com/2018/11/automatically-minifying-cshtml-files-in.html"},{"by":"DanBC","descendants":5,"id":18520964,"kids":[18520972,18521438],"score":2,"time":1543045373,"title":"Everything is awesome: Don't forget the Lego (Passing a swallowed Lego head)","type":"story","url":"https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jpc.14309"},{"by":"max_sendfeld","descendants":193,"id":18520898,"kids":[18525231,18522188,18523299,18521947,18521548,18521265,18521313,18521310,18521411,18522891,18522856,18521417,18522822,18521388,18521726,18521422,18521959,18523825,18521867,18522645,18522757,18521817,18522063,18525425,18523487,18523483,18521690,18522385,18521420],"score":298,"time":1543043808,"title":"Nnn – a terminal file manager for programmers","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/jarun/nnn"},{"by":"camtarn","descendants":28,"id":18520903,"kids":[18521928,18523037,18522059,18524624,18524151,18522035,18522831],"score":89,"time":1543043922,"title":"Making transparent wood [video]","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1H-323d838"},{"by":"atum47","descendants":1,"id":18520810,"kids":[18520812,18521188],"score":2,"time":1543041333,"title":"PWA, what's the right way to cache your app offline?","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/victorqribeiro/create"},{"by":"wbsun","descendants":2,"id":18520806,"kids":[18521434,18521480],"score":13,"text":"There have been many super IT companies which used to be the top of the entire industry and shine, but now being either nowhere or struggling.

What is Product Hunt about\n2. How to Build an Early Beta Audience\n3. How Do You Know What’s the Right Time to Launch — on Product Hunt\n4. How to Get Your Launch Story Right — with a clear message\n5. How to Leverage Your Launch to Get Press Coverage<p>Also included are lessons learned about:<p>-What type of content do you need and how to align your messages\n-Tips and facts about small things that could break or make your launch (for example OG images and file sizes)\n- How to structure and plan the launch day (I’ve included an Airtable with our examples and planning—for you to copy and reuse)\n- Most importantly, how you can use your launch to think together with hundreds if not thousands of people.  \n- Finally I cover the 3 things I found most valuable, and will try to focus on even more in the future.<p>I&#x27;m adding a link because it contains a lot of images and gifs — and copying them over would be a bit of a nuisance.

Do you regret it?<p>I am so anxious right now I can&#x27;t even sleep at night.<p>Thanks for your time and answers in advance.","time":1542832068,"title":"Ask HN: Who do you realize is time to give up in something?","type":"story"},{"by":"pestkranker","descendants":85,"id":18505514,"kids":[18505833,18506637,18506555,18505850,18505711,18505658,18506424,18507419,18506025,18506251,18508028,18505713,18507176,18506618,18505546,18510260],"score":60,"time":1542830179,"title":"Google Assistant iOS update lets you say ‘Hey Siri, OK Google’","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/21/google-assistant-ios-update-lets-you-say-hey-siri-ok-google/"},{"by":"danyork","descendants":3,"id":18505382,"kids":[18506570,18506255,18506477],"score":13,"time":1542829214,"title":"Software Patents Considered Harmful","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@jdrosen2/software-patents-considered-harmful-868166fa437d"},{"by":"bradrydzewski","descendants":2,"id":18505257,"kids":[18505466,18505328],"score":10,"time":1542828163,"title":"Announcing Drone Cloud, a Free Continuous Integration Service for X86 and Arm","type":"story","url":"https://blog.drone.io/drone-cloud/"},{"by":"dankohn1","descendants":181,"id":18505136,"kids":[18507844,18505424,18505385,18506357,18505491,18505532,18505379,18505776,18505892,18505885,18507702,18505498,18505431,18505451,18505383,18505430,18505418,18505502,18505415,18505392,18505813,18505552,18505624,18505750,18505507],"score":73,"time":1542827264,"title":"American Is Killed by Bow and Arrow on Remote Indian Island","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/world/asia/american-killed-andaman-island-tribe.html"},{"by":"propman","descendants":82,"id":18505126,"kids":[18505377,18505521,18505542,18505913,18505882,18505698,18506085,18505996,18505459,18505909,18505537,18505993,18505519,18506066,18505561],"score":62,"time":1542827233,"title":"Life Sentence for British Student Draws Criticism for U.A.E","type":"story","url":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/life-sentence-for-british-student-casts-shadow-over-u-a-e-1542820081"},{"by":"gerbilly","descendants":27,"id":18504948,"kids":[18506783,18507786,18508632,18507618,18508026,18508517,18508913,18509114,18509002,18516302,18511646,18509049],"score":300,"time":1542825897,"title":"Learn Git Branching","type":"story","url":"https://learngitbranching.js.org/"},{"by":"ccnafr","descendants":2,"id":18504946,"kids":[18506992,18507040],"score":15,"time":1542825892,"title":"Offensive testing to make Dropbox (and the world) a safer place","type":"story","url":"https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2018/11/offensive-testing-to-make-dropbox-and-the-world-a-safer-place/"},{"by":"fanf2","descendants":5,"id":18504932,"kids":[18505356,18506907,18509277,18508607],"score":72,"time":1542825783,"title":"IBM's future system of the past","type":"story","url":"http://www.jfsowa.com/computer/"},{"by":"bonhardcomp","descendants":17,"id":18504929,"kids":[18505320,18512221,18506068,18515774],"score":33,"time":1542825755,"title":"Show HN: Truck.app – an rsync client for Mac","type":"story","url":"http://bonhardcomputing.com/truck/#2018-11-21"},{"by":"rbultje","descendants":37,"id":18504930,"kids":[18508112,18504990,18506431,18505685,18507174,18505802],"score":125,"time":1542825772,"title":"Dav1d: performance and completion of the first release","type":"story","url":"http://www.jbkempf.com/blog/post/2018/dav1d-toward-the-first-release"},{"by":"digital55","descendants":29,"id":18504921,"kids":[18506809,18506881,18506981,18506784],"score":45,"time":1542825697,"title":"Galactic Beacons Get Snuffed Out in a Cosmic Eyeblink","type":"story","url":"https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-changing-look-quasars-appear-to-vanish-20181121/"},{"by":"tallmansixfour","descendants":3,"id":18505028,"kids":[18506417,18506129],"score":9,"text":"The tiny text and my big fingers are a frustrating combo on mobile.
