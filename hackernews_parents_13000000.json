I&#x27;m a bit better of a programmer compared to myself in 2010 and I know a bit more CS, but the last project I worked on that I was truly proud of was my undergrad thesis.<p>The problem is that I have the ambition. It&#x27;s there. Hell, it&#x27;s swelling inside of me, but I just don&#x27;t know what to do. I have this desire to hack up something I&#x27;m proud of, but with such a limited amount of time I feel like I should be spending it on something that will help me keep my job long-term.<p>And I&#x27;m doing neither.<p>And I&#x27;m not learning more CS which I would prefer to either one.<p>And I feel like I&#x27;m decaying into a husk of my former self.<p>Help?","time":1485378792,"title":"Finding time for side projects and keeping marketable skills current","type":"story"},{"by":"artsandsci","descendants":18,"id":13486051,"kids":[13487424,13487959,13487770,13488593,13487524,13487641,13487247,13486491],"score":20,"time":1485378086,"title":"Google has banned 200 publishers since it passed a new policy against fake news","type":"story","url":"http://www.recode.net/2017/1/25/14375750/google-adsense-advertisers-publishers-fake-news"},{"by":"rwieruch","descendants":69,"id":13485919,"kids":[13486716,13486481,13486739,13488500,13486267,13487069,13487953,13488935,13486885,13486656,13487834,13541235,13487251,13488259,13487732,13489939,13488501],"score":158,"time":1485377370,"title":"Lessons Learned from “On Writing Well”","type":"story","url":"https://www.robinwieruch.de/lessons-learned-on-writing-well/"},{"by":"evolve2k","descendants":91,"id":13485669,"kids":[13485913,13485973,13485871,13485992,13486156,13486028,13486181,13486409,13486250,13485882,13486252,13487689,13485907,13485964,13486133,13485986,13486225,13487324,13486262,13493451,13486274,13486100,13486020,13488280,13486268,13489093,13486107,13487406,13487915,13485960,13485963,13486002,13485935,13486080,13486088,13486077,13486190,13485974,13488339,13488715,13487186,13485947,13486004,13487041,13485952,13486032,13486125,13485985,13486668,13496457,13486525,13485890,13485929,13514373,13486598,13486052,13486867,13486358,13486503,13485988,13487162,13490298,13486175,13493452],"score":50,"text":"Being the Open Internet advocates that they are, you would imagine that most of us are generally big supporters of Firefox.

Scaphold is a GraphQL backend-as-a-service platform that helps you build apps fast. We built Scaphold because we were app developers and we were frustrated by how long it took. We started building apps together back in college, and every time we started a new project we found that we spent a lot of time doing the same things. Whether it was setting up the infrastructure, integrating APIs, managing REST endpoints, or even implementing something as simple as pagination it took a lot of time. BaaS platforms have existed before but we were disillusioned by the lack of flexibility they provided. This all changed the day we first found GraphQL in an article posted here about a year and half ago (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=10217887\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=10217887</a>).<p>At the time, we were working at Microsoft and started hacking on what eventually became Scaphold at night and on weekends. We were driven by this vision to be the foundation for people&#x27;s apps, the scaffolding of their masterpieces. We were lucky to get accepted into the YC Fellowship program last April and launched our first version of Scaphold last May. We learned a lot. The Fellowship program helped us gain initial traction and after several months of focusing on product and strong growth, we reapplied to the YC Core program and were fortunate enough to be given an opportunity to join the winter batch and to continue the dream.<p>Since then we have been hard at work improving the platform and have reconstructed it from the ground up. Today, Scaphold powers thousands of apps and we think it solves a lot of the problems of BaaS platforms that came before it. We&#x27;re really excited about what we have built and would love for you to try it out. It&#x27;s free to sign up and development tier stays free forever so you can get straight to building apps.<p>We&#x27;d love to hear your feedback and are happy to answer any questions.

Before it, way before I ever was concerned about getting something before graduation, I used to be excited about CS. I would read books, do tech, and many other things. When the job search came, I became depressed, and now finally burned out.<p>I&#x27;ve had several final interviews with unknown, non-tech companies, but never managed to snag an offer. I worked at a contract job (NodeJS) for 2 months. I keep reading online advice: work on projects and study interviewing problems. The thing is... no one has ever asked me any challenging tech questions in interviews, and no one has asked about my past projects.<p>My recent interviews:<p>1) Last week I got a referral from HN for a defense company. I&#x27;m waiting to see if they&#x27;ll proceed to a 2nd interview.<p>2) Last month, I didn&#x27;t make it past the 2nd interviewer for a QA role, because the interview thought I wasn&#x27;t convincing enough to transition to QA from someone with developer experience.<p>3) Last month, I couldn&#x27;t make it past a phone screen for a tech startup, because either the recruiter said I stated a too high salary (he didn&#x27;t let me proceed until I said something): $80k - $90k in NYC, where Glassdoor states the average is $110k; or he got confused and thought I was fired from my 2-month contract (I wasn&#x27;t; it ended on great terms).<p>So, I&#x27;m terribly burned out. What should I be doing in order to improve my life? CS has been my entire life -- from computer camps (Montclair University, Stevens Insitute, etc.) of playing Starcraft on LAN, to reverse engineering of programs, to weekly installs of Linux distros on high school weekends. I really don&#x27;t know anything else, and would like rekindle the light. I obviously can&#x27;t take a vacation. Maybe there&#x27;s an interesting book or recommended exercise routine.","time":1484960822,"title":"Ask HN: How to deal with job search burnout?","type":"story"},{"by":"aceperry","dead":true,"id":13448201,"kids":[13448271,13448331],"score":2,"time":1484960759,"title":"Photos: The Crowd at Donald Trump’s Inauguration vs. Barack Obama’s","type":"story","url":"http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/20/14332462/photos-crowd-trump-inauguration-vs-obama"},{"by":"geolqued","descendants":21,"id":13448166,"kids":[13448546,13448243,13448612,13448641],"score":71,"time":1484960108,"title":"GRVI Phalanx joins The Kilocore Club","type":"story","url":"http://fpga.org/2017/01/12/grvi-phalanx-joins-the-kilocore-club/"},{"by":"alfiedotwtf","descendants":2,"id":13448154,"kids":[13448640,13448871],"score":16,"time":1484959856,"title":"Startups, ditch the Table Tennis","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@alandownie/bro-ditch-the-table-tennis-5ff05cde65b8"},{"by":"bifrost","descendants":57,"id":13448141,"kids":[13448529,13448478,13448583,13448451,13448820,13448572,13448703,13449030,13448917,13448696,13449058,13448475],"score":27,"time":1484959648,"title":"In Marin, if you speed on your bicycle you're now going to get a ticket","type":"story","url":"http://www.mbr.co.uk/news/radar-guns-used-limit-speeds-mountain-bike-trails-339947"},{"by":"l33tbro","descendants":3,"id":13448122,"kids":[13448287,13448295],"score":2,"text":"Curious if you guys have had much experience with it?<p>Was blasting a 500 hz pure turn way to loud to get into flow state yesterday.

But because the job description states 10 years of experience, whereas I have 8, the HR is preparing me an offer at one level below (but still an equivalent promotion for me).<p>Secondly, I graduated during the last recession, so my salary history is low.  Their HR has heavily indicated that they base offers on prior salary history, with a 10-15% max bump.  Glassdoor has base salary at 30% higher than mine, same company and title, but HR denies that it is accurate.<p>Due to circumstances, 10-15% may not bring much net savings increase for me.  Presumably the job is of higher responsibility and workload, so only 30% becomes meaningful to me.<p>Questions:<p>1. How should I feel about being brought in one level lower strictly because of years of experience on paper?  If there were doubts about my ability, they certainly didn&#x27;t test harder questions during the interview.<p>2. How do I get HR to match what is on Glassdoor?  I might get another offer soon, but HR indicated they want a prompt response.  I doubt my company would move fast enough with a counteroffer too (VP is on vacation).

I am learning through freeCodeCamp mostly and although I&#x27;m happy with my progress, I feel I am lacking any training on a few essential skills to properly perform at a job, namely: working in a team, practical collaboration through git&#x2F;github,  feedback on comments, how to create code that fits well with code from other people on a bigger project, how to read and understand other people&#x27;s code.<p><i>Why a side-project?</i><p>I know a mentor could just give guidance, but to dig deeper in the semantics here I want a mentor that also is a coach that also is a boss. As mentioned above I also would like to have hands-on experience with a real life project. And, by my understanding, this project being a side-project means more room for experimentation (like experimenting having a mentee helping out), less pressure for results (as in $ results), fewer people involved in any decision process (from having a mentee to deciding what task to pass to the mentee).<p><i>Why me?</i><p>I think I can genuinely help.

I&#x27;m in my late thirties and I spent my entire career at tech startups (as founder or employee up to CTO and VP Product positions). I never scored really big, but I earned well. I&#x27;m currently free to start something new and I might look for a new job as tech or product lead, but I&#x27;m also entertaining a thought of launching a SaaS business.<p>I don&#x27;t have a groundbreaking or innovative idea, but I&#x27;m great at execution. I&#x27;m more than happy to bootstrap something small, without ever taking outside capital, a company which will never grow over few dozen employees. I&#x27;m looking for a quite likely path to build a $5-25M company rather than a quite unlikely path to build a $100M-1B company (the latter seems to be the dominating goal in startup community).<p>Considering the above, can creating a clone within an established area be the way to go? Something like another website monitoring service, another ticket system or another ecommerce CRM. None of these is actually something I want to pursue, but you can get the idea.<p>I understand that building a product is just the beginning and that much more effort is required into marketing and sales and I&#x27;m prepared for that (I know that underestimating it is a common mistake made by techies wanting to launch their own business), but they are also the areas I&#x27;m least experienced (although not totally inexperienced), so I&#x27;m unsure if this is a good idea.<p>I would love your opinions on whether what I want to do is viable. Or should I forget it because I will just do better by launching a software house or by creating an offshore development center for some US&#x2F;EU company (I&#x27;m from the Central&#x2F;Eastern Europe so it&#x27;s the best place for this considering talent&#x2F;culture&#x2F;salaries mix)?

So far, that they really may as well be science fiction.  It seems quite odd to me, as a technologist, that they seem allergic to shorter term time horizons. I&#x27;m guessing it is some kind of mental anguish avoidance? For instance, if you know your&#x27;e going to die within 100 years, and all this amazing world changing tech is going to happen in 150 years, then you can just let your brain soak in all the cool and fun 150 year ideas, and skip the part where you die 50 years before they happen.  Feels good, and you can think you&#x27;re making progress somehow.<p>Maybe its just more exciting and fun to think about, like science fiction. Perhaps its pseudoprogress.  It could be like procrastination, where instead of doing that thing you&#x27;re supposed to, you learn more, or watch something educational.  It seems like progress, but is it?  I guess its better than video games. Shifting your focus onto opportunities that occur only after shorter term problems are solved, at the cost of those short term problems is a bad deal.<p>Fix todays problems today, and tomorrows problems tomorrow.

I work in the network&#x2F;security space in NYC where I write some code - basic Python scripts to automate, monitor infra., etc. The most complicated thing I&#x27;ve written is a multi-threaded script that interacts with a REST API. I didn&#x27;t take CS courses at school.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about learning some CS fundamentals. It sounds challenging, some of it may be fun and going forward, it&#x27;s going to be tough to survive in the networks&#x2F;security space without programming skills since everything is moving in the direction of software. I&#x27;m not interested in frontend web dev&#x2F;JS. I&#x27;d like to concentrate on backend stuff, preferably using Python but am open to other options.<p>Based on my research, there seem to be at least 3 paths:<p>1. MOOCs&#x2F;Online degrees: The most recommended option. However, I&#x27;m not motivated enough to effectively complete these. This goes against the HN ethos but I prefer a classroom setting (took a certificate course in Python at NYU and it was useful).<p>2. Boot Camps: The only part-time, non Ruby centric, bootcamp I found is Byte Academy. From their information session, they seemed disorganized with the message &quot;you&#x27;ll build a web application, here are some examples&quot;. This doesn&#x27;t seem useful for someone looking to learn CS fundamentals. Does anyone here have experience with Byte Academy?<p>3. Courses at Columbia&#x2F;NYU&#x2F;etc.: I don&#x27;t need a degree but I&#x27;m unsure if taking individual courses is an option. \n * Couldn&#x27;t find information on Columbia&#x27;s website that suggested that it is.\n * Found http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ptgrad.poly.edu&#x2F; at NYU which seems to allow attending some courses but I&#x27;m not certain.<p>I was hoping to get some advice on the options mentioned above and in case there are other avenues that I should explore.

Learning was very slow, and I was never good enough to contribute. Then, I built a (crappy) side project that got some surprising traction, and found myself briefly &quot;CTO&quot; of a startup! We hired some engineers, and though I kept writing code I was not the CTO. The startup failed. This process repeated itself a few more times.<p>I&#x27;ve now been writing code full-time for 6 years, but always in the same language! I&#x27;ve written hello world apps in a handful of languages and I understand the basic concepts, but every time I start to build a new project, I feel like such a newbie in a new language. I hate googling to debug syntax for  some trivial task when I could already have finished the whole project. I also have to go through the learning curve all over again to come up with best practices for that language.<p>I&#x27;ve worked with a bunch of frameworks, DBs, distros, VCS, etc, so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m incapable of learning. There&#x27;s just something different about your core language.<p>I fell into doing some part-time contracting work 2 years ago, and I was shocked when a company agreed to pay me $100&#x2F;hr. Fast forward 2 years later and now I charge $250&#x2F;hr. I made $400k USD cash last year working reasonable hours. Everything I can find says I&#x27;m <i>really</i> well paid. My friends with CS degrees from MIT&#x2F;Waterloo don&#x27;t make this much.<p>The company I consult for the most has asked me to come on full time. They&#x27;re offering to pay me what I made last year, with more stability and benefits. They want my title to be Principal Architect. A lot of the engineers I work with here come from big software companies you know of, went to great schools, are experts in many languages, etc. They don&#x27;t make nearly as much as I do. They know my code, but not my background.<p>Am I an imposter?

Any help will be greatly appreciated ;)<p>Draft:\n- A couple of servers would run various checks and store the results in a central database, a public page would be available at internet.rip and display the status of the Internet with details on ongoing outages and their estimated impact.\n- Check most DNS servers (TLDs, ISPs, Public), public routers status (not sure how to do this, looking glass?), public BGP routes for instabilities or missing routes, Internet Exchanges status, route, latency and packet loss to most IPs (best would be to find the smallest set of IPv4 to monitor passing through the highest number of different routers to be able to draw a map of network paths and their status)\n- Keep the infrastructure simple: don&#x27;t want to need a server on each AS so it would best to monitor from the outside as much as possible, otherwise this could be a different approach with an open-source deamon people can install on their servers to contribute, but that&#x27;s much more complicated.\n- Make internet.rip (the website) as resilient to network issues as possible and for this I&#x27;m thinking CDN, multiple DNS, very long caching of the public page, service workers and multiple API endpoints to fetch the data reachable through JS directly using their IP so it could even work without any DNS if you have the site in cache.\n- Keep internet.rip free by limiting the cost, the infrastructure will be supported by me.

Before processing their payment, I would like to verify that the user actually owns the email address that they entered.<p>Of course the popular way of doing this is to send the user an email with a link that they have to click. To continue the trend of not maintaining my own backend, it would be nice to have an API that does this for me.<p>The basic functionality would be as follows. For simplicity, I&#x27;ll refer to this hypothetical thing as &quot;the API.&quot;<p>1. App sends an email address to the API.\n2. The API sends an email to the email address. \n3. User clicks a link in the email, taking them to a simple &quot;thank you&quot;-style page at the API.\n4. The API marks that email as verified.\n5.

We&#x27;ve discussed the matters before, but now that it&#x27;s in effect, so to speak, I&#x27;m unable to ask them for their advice any longer. Thanks to my tech salary I&#x27;ve already paid off my student loans, and have no outstanding debt. My question lies not in what to do with the liquid assets my parents left me (we&#x27;ve talked about it), but with their surprise parting gift: about $1.5 million in ownership of multiple home properties.<p>My parents rented these houses out for a total of around $70k&#x2F;yr (before taxes) as passive income in their retirement (though my father did manage the properties himself). They also left me the house they raised me in. The value for these houses has always been fairly stable, though recently they have been increasing in value at about 7-10% year.<p>I&#x27;m currently unmarried (my parents were old for my age), but I&#x27;m hoping to marry soon and eventually raise a child. What&#x27;s the best course of action to ensure not only a comfortable future for me, but also to ensure the best possible future for my familY? I&#x27;ve always wanted to potentially take a break from my tech job to pursue a startup, and now I feel like I may have the means to do so without jeopardizing my family&#x27;s future. Is temporarily living on the income from rent advisable to do this, or should I just sit on the houses until they accumulate some optimal value to liquidate and invest at, or should I keep my job and put the passive income from the rent into buying another property and snowballing from there (though real estate really isn&#x27;t my favorite thing in the world... I&#x27;m sure I could pay someone a cut to manage the properties, though)?<p>Lawyers and accountants are helpful in making any of these options happen, but to do so requires I actually know what I want them to do. This is a very generous gift on my parents&#x27; part, but I&#x27;m a little overwhelmed.","time":1483577369,"title":"Ask HN: Large inheritance windfall.

The VC is from Hong Kong and has had a couple of small exits (under $50 million USD) in the early 2000s. In 2015, he suggested that we work together on a product, with him taking care of the business side of things and me writing the MVP. He told me that he had contact at firm X where he would show the demo and raise money.<p>So after a month of working on MVP, things started to move more slowly. Throughout the year, we would huddle for a bit at his place and long periods where I wouldn&#x27;t hear anything. He was on vacation while I was working on the MVP. This was in March. Many months would go with just &quot;waiting on person Y at firm X&quot; and then summer came. He says that he wants to put his 22 year old daughter who recently graduated as CEO and says he will mentor her and says we would work good together. I found it odd.<p>It&#x27;s august now, nothing has changed and now he has some family matters to attend and he needs to delay the meet until November where it would be optimal for him to make the trip back to HK where firm X is. So more months follow with silence until November arrives.<p>When I ask if he demo&#x27;d the MVP or not I get a bit confused by his answer because he blamed a small one off bug that wasn&#x27;t super critical (it&#x27;s an MVP for christ&#x27;s sake) as a reason for not showing the demo.<p>I did some googling and he is known in HK circles but I discovered through offshoreleaks.org that he has multiple shell companies setup in British Virgin Islands with his daughter as a shareholder presumably from his exits. His buyer was a firm working for US military (I&#x27;m personally against helping defense industry)<p>Now he’s excited again by my new idea and wants to work on it together. I am hesitant.

two experiences recently with Upwork that gave me a lot of pause. In both cases it was clear that the people I was talking to had nothing at all to do with the record of work, feedback and billing that I had reviewed. In both cases there were also strong signs that the person was not located where they claimed and were not fluent speakers of the principal language of their locality. In one case I&#x27;m pretty sure they were using a Text to Speech engine once I demanded a Skype interview. Both wriggled out of video interview for different reasons.<p>I know that there are simple ways to avoid these traps. However, I also know that once these trends set in, the approaches become more sophisticated. So I&#x27;m concerned that Upwork may really no longer be safe to do business on.<p>After all, if someone who seems reasonably legitimate and has real feedback is willing to sell their Upwork credentials, then what else would they be willing to sell?","time":1483456677,"title":"Ask HN: Anyone experienced Upwork accounts changing hands?","type":"story"},{"by":"radagast","descendants":25,"id":13309624,"kids":[13310433,13310436,13310180,13310100,13314092,13314111,13312515,13310485],"score":138,"time":1483456457,"title":"The Isdalen mystery","type":"story","url":"https://www.nrk.no/dokumentar/xl/the-isdalen-mystery-1.13249066"},{"by":"kungfudoi","descendants":256,"id":13309610,"kids":[13311532,13309939,13312286,13309853,13310394,13311687,13312411,13310518,13310080,13309925,13312496,13310115,13310451,13315073,13310830,13312288,13311215,13313486,13310139,13310075,13310173,13310029,13315202,13318979,13310721,13312847,13313130,13310633,13311909,13311713,13317054,13314945,13313111,13335981,13314700,13311551,13310863,13311700,13326451,13309929,13315172],"score":511,"time":1483456339,"title":"Startup Puts Everything You Need for a Two-Acre Farm in a Shipping Container","type":"story","url":"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/san-francisco-startup-puts-everything-you-need-two-acre-farm-shipping-container-180961567/?no-ist"},{"by":"metachris","descendants":17,"id":13309534,"kids":[13310445,13311673,13311705,13310610,13311210,13311413,13310739,13311104,13309697,13311634],"score":63,"time":1483455713,"title":"Great talks and presentations at 33C3","type":"story","url":"https://www.metachris.com/2017/01/great-talks-and-presentations-at-33c3/"},{"by":"jason0916","descendants":3,"id":13309371,"kids":[13309738,13309587],"score":1,"text":"aredis is an effecient and user-friendly async client.\n1.

I was kind of fine with it but then today they also told me they would need to install ubuntu on it (the work they do is node.js&#x2F;android so unix type system is not a requirement) and format my system drive as well. I think that&#x27;s crazy. It&#x27;s my system and I should be able to control what happens to it. Yes I can of course quit but this should not be a thing.<p>The reason they gave everyone is that they cannot risk people using pirated windows but I don&#x27;t have a single bit of pirated code on my system and they still insisted on it. I was hoping to probe good people of HN to see what they think. I realize they can request whatever they want and final control still lies with me but I think this is very personal invasion of my privacy and rights to my own rig.<p>And my laptop is a lennovo yoga the flex version, it has touch screen and screen folds back. It&#x27;s semi hybrid version and Ubuntu would look laughably  bad and criminally useless on my machine. Not to mention I have all my workstation set up on it. I told them I have genuine windows which will be rendered useless and their response was that I can always take my machine to the service center and tell them to install windows again. My internship is 6 months long so all this trouble would only be for 6 months to begin with.<p>I tried to negotiate quite a bit but they don&#x27;t seem to budge. Dual boot, VM, or just working with windows all don&#x27;t seem to make any dent in their resolve. If I cannot resolve it tomorrow I will have to either escalate it to top management (it&#x27;s a small 300 person company) or just give up and leave.<p>I am not looking for any legal recourse, instead I am just trying to find your take on the matter.<p>PS Ask HN part is malformatted and bring is brng to go around the 80 character limit.","time":1483379802,"title":"Ask HN: Is it ok to ask interns to

been a web developer my whole career, with a CS degree, and 16 years experience. In 2007 I joined a new VOD startup and quickly rose to CTO position, then over the next 9 years grew it to 7-figure users and revenue, 16 engineers, and a highly respected brand in an industry niche. We hit a rough financial patch, so I left for another seed-stage startup which failed to gain traction.<p>Now, for the first time in 16 years I find myself looking for a job in SV without a direct reference. I was assuming that my broad experience, ability to bridge the technology-business gap, natural programming ability, and entrepreneurial spirit and tenacity would make me the kind of sought after employee that all growing SV companies claim they can&#x27;t find enough of.<p>Unfortunately after interviewing at ten top companies (mostly later stage YC), I&#x27;ve been declined nine times. The last company where I felt the onsite went flawlessly and I had great rapport with every interviewer still thinks my experience isn&#x27;t exactly the right fit for a tech lead position (even though this is exactly what I&#x27;ve done for the last 9 years!).<p>The things I think are hurting me are that I&#x27;m not great at whiteboarding, my experience is not at massive scale, and it&#x27;s hard to summarize the scope and impact of what I&#x27;ve done as CTO growing a team from 2 to 16 engineers. Also the majority of interviewers are in their mid-20s and have come from Google, Facebook, Dropbox, Twitter, Uber, etc; I doubt they even have the context to understand the strength of my accomplishments. They seem to have fat hiring pipelines and value either top-1% algorithm brainteaser performance or specific large-scale experience at brand-name companies.<p>I&#x27;m coming away with the impression that SV is starting resemble the world of finance where pedigree is utmost importance.

Also, we still can&#x27;t fully understand how ideas come into our minds, it might be more than just random connections and memories.<p>Entertainment is highly connected to humans, empathy, emotions etc, which I expect it will take us a while to fully understand and thus &#x27;teach&#x27; computers about, or help them learn about it themselves.

It is. WE&#x27;RE READY TO START BACKEND DEVELOPMENT. Here&#x27;s the catch, we can&#x27;t hire anyone. But we&#x27;re really wanting a fourth partner to buy into the vision and be excited about solving complex problems with us by leading the charge in developing our idea.

HN,<p>I have an interesting problem for you guys. One that has been much harder than I expected it to be. I got into manufacturing kids clothing and was much too ambitious with my factory orders. In short, I have about 2.5K costumes that I need to sell or give away by February (before Amazon’s long term storage fees kick in). Ideally I want to recoup some of my investment so I can this side project going (I now have time to devote to it) but happy to give them away to a good cause.<p>I thought about donating them because they are high-quality and could keep a lot of kids warm (and kids love them) but I’m looking at 50 50lb boxes for 2,500 costumes. I can’t scalably ship this many to myself and deal with them. Further, my local Salvation Army doesn’t want more than 100. Here’s a few of the links. I can have Amazon dispose them for a minimal cost, but this seems like a waste.

looking for advice on finding work as an experienced web developer in small or mid-sized companies or non-profits focused in ethical areas such as education, healthcare, or clean energy. I&#x27;ll refer to such an organization here as a &quot;QO&quot;, for Qualified Organization. I don&#x27;t mean to offend anyone working for non-QOs.<p>I have credible education, work experience and open source participation. I&#x27;m not working now, and my situation is stable so I can take some time to look. I don&#x27;t need much money, just enough to afford a small apartment, basic necessities, some savings, and small luxuries. I&#x27;m willing to relocate to certain U.S. cities or work remotely.<p>I&#x27;ve gotten some positive response but no offers or paid work. I&#x27;ve applied to over fifty places in the past six months, not all of them QOs, which is more than nothing but I feel like that number should be in the hundreds. I don&#x27;t want to stay where I am now so local networking would not be very helpful. My main job sites are http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.idealist.org, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;whoishiring.io (WIH), and the monthly HN hiring posts. I know that WIH aggregates from HN but I like going through the HN posts anyway. Idealist is focused on QOs but not technical work. WIH and HN are focused on technical work but not QOs. The signal-to-noise ratio on Indeed is low and I rarely look there, and I assume it&#x27;s the same for other big job sites like Dice.<p>I&#x27;m open to freelancing. I would be fine with making sites for truly charitable QOs for free or token payment. Is there a site that connects developers to QOs to do this sort of work? I also eventually need work that will pay enough to live on.<p>Any advice appreciated. I&#x27;ve left out specific information so the discussion is generally useful and less blatantly about hiring me personally, but I can add an email address to my profile if anyone wants to talk about specific work or just wants to chat privately.","time":1482780725,"title":"Ask HN: Finding ethical work","type":"story"},{"by":"JumpCrisscross","descendants":83,"id":13259438,"kids":[13262228,13260491,13262437,13260978,13261306,13260792,13261073,13260863,13262019,13262432,13262592,13261206,13261702,13261803,13262288,13262128,13261601],"score":89,"time":1482780745,"title":"America Needs a New Moon Mission","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-12-25/america-needs-a-new-moon-mission"},{"by":"adammunich","descendants":112,"id":13259429,"kids":[13263181,13260898,13260810,13260183,13259935,13259949,13260479,13262176,13259911,13260663,13259681,13260917,13264005,13260465,13264493,13259930,13261675,13259920,13260800,13263826,13271593,13260026,13260030,13259867,13261847,13259910,13260127,13261836,13259832,13260596,13261485,13261519,13261525],"score":272,"time":1482780613,"title":"Show HN: Learn how to build electronics with monthly kits","type":"story","url":"https://thimble.io"},{"by":"chuckus","descendants":8,"id":13259424,"kids":[13261959,13273067,13262404,13263680,13261919],"score":32,"time":1482780538,"title":"Dasher: Writing text really fast without typing or speaking","type":"story","url":"https://inventability.net/articles/reviews/dasher.html"},{"by":"mikecarlton","descendants":169,"id":13259415,"kids":[13259575,13259830,13259908,13260181,13259602,13259525,13259585,13259782,13259610,13304746,13259540,13259783,13259552,13259873,13259709,13259628,13259859,13261932,13259535,13261059,13261278,13260289,13260152],"score":149,"time":1482780328,"title":"GCE vs. AWS in 2016: Why You Shouldn't Use Amazon","type":"story","url":"https://thehftguy.com/2016/06/15/gce-vs-aws-in-2016-why-you-should-never-use-amazon/"},{"by":"vezycash","descendants":6,"id":13259467,"kids":[13259795,13259811,13260225],"score":24,"time":1482781221,"title":"Schmidt calls tech a 4-way race: Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook","type":"story","url":"http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/tech-sanity-check/schmidt-calls-tech-a-4-way-race-google-apple-amazon-and-facebook/"},{"by":"ashishb4u","descendants":203,"id":13259399,"kids":[13259608,13259641,13261344,13259762,13259745,13259883,13259864,13259604,13262461,13259607,13262376,13260664,13260787,13259656,13259588,13260245,13269248,13259697,13260044,13259917,13259706,13259904,13259616],"score":420,"time":1482780102,"title":"How to find size of an array in C without sizeof","type":"story","url":"http://arjunsreedharan.org/post/69303442896/the-difference-between-arr-and-arr-how-to-find"},{"by":"swiss2008","descendants":104,"id":13259133,"kids":[13260049,13259484,13269626,13259711,13259878,13260624,13260071,13259813,13260732,13259821,13260683,13260691,13259997,13259860,13259663],"score":88,"time":1482775935,"title":"Female founders who've had a great 2016","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/gallery/40-female-founders-who-crushed-it-in-2016/"},{"by":"alexakisalex","descendants":31,"id":13259106,"kids":[13260101,13260359,13259325,13259694,13265111,13260106,13259476,13259672,13259139,13263527,13259120,13259801,13266199],"score":20,"text":"I work as a Product Manager in a 100+ employees startup.

Do we accept that a full OS update should be part of the standard opt in for &quot;app store updates&quot;?<p>Obviously for my case, it was a problem.","time":1482726470,"title":"Ask HN: Sierra macOS 4gb download without confirmation, is this acceptable?","type":"story"},{"by":"vezycash","descendants":34,"id":13256872,"kids":[13256933,13256930,13257140,13257147],"score":73,"time":1482725172,"title":"Power surge: Chinese electric car battery maker charges for global market","type":"story","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-autos-batteries-idUSKBN14E0K1"},{"by":"kevlar1818","descendants":39,"id":13256709,"kids":[13258214,13258590,13257949,13258055,13257887,13258289,13258098,13258253,13259019],"score":106,"time":1482721666,"title":"Mycroft – A.I. for everyone","type":"story","url":"https://docs.mycroft.ai/"},{"by":"JumpCrisscross","descendants":132,"id":13256676,"kids":[13256922,13256885,13256881,13256980,13260344,13257911,13257033,13258094,13257006,13257454,13266607,13260561,13257264],"score":67,"time":1482720828,"title":"The hunt for dollars to build the $64B bullet train","type":"story","url":"http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-bullet-train-cash-20161224-story.html"},{"by":"snake117","descendants":11,"id":13256666,"kids":[13257385,13258015,13257715],"score":43,"time":1482720710,"title":"First serotonin neurons made from human stem cells (2015)","type":"story","url":"http://news.wisc.edu/first-serotonin-neurons-made-from-human-stem-cells/"},{"by":"tyagis","descendants":2,"id":13256632,"kids":[13256957,13256958],"score":1,"text":"I am an absolute beginner and would like to learn the language intricacies along with the proper etiquette.

the co-founder of Gaza Sky Geeks, the first startup incubator&#x2F;accelerator&#x2F;tech hub in Gaza. Just had a conversation with Michael Seibel (CEO of YC accelerator) in which he said we have to figure out NOW what the Silicon Valley will be for all Arab startups in the future.<p>How important do you think this is for the Arab world, or emerging markets more broadly? Has any country outside of the US created such a central hub yet? Why is it critical to figure it out at such an early stage, and is it really realistic to expect hubs as central as Silicon Valley to emerge around the world?<p>From my perspective, even though we&#x27;re building $1B companies, we&#x27;ve got to focus on the next 6-12 months for now. Gazan startups just closed the second round of seed investments in their history. As an accelerator, we&#x27;re working on our second round - we&#x27;re where YC was in 2006. We&#x27;re focused on things like getting 12 hours of electricity for our entrepreneurs (www.powerupgazageeks.com), setting up their first legal entities (that took a LOT of time), figuring out where we provide the most value (sweet spot seems to be bringing mentors to Gaza and taking startups out of Gaza - most of the folks we work with have never been more than 30 miles from home before because they essentially live in a prison).<p>Plus, the geo-political environment around us is changing. A few years ago Beirut, Cairo, Amman looked like the potential startup hubs for the region. Now I&#x27;d lean towards Dubai, though it faces another challenge (too much security control of the internet &gt; Google won&#x27;t open an engineering hub there as a result).<p>If you&#x27;ve got any experience thinking through this in Europe, Africa, LatAm, Asia... would love to hear your thoughts.","time":1482441135,"title":"How important is it for emerging markets to identify their “Silicon

Python was a suitable choice for many problems I have encountered as because the ecosystem is extremely broad and it is very easy to get started, not just because the language is simple, but because of the popular &quot;battery-included&quot; frameworks. This means I can deliver value must faster from the beginning.<p>But having worked in a company which develops many different production systems developed over a period of 10 years, some running on platforms such as Debian etch, I can&#x27;t help to think that had an enterprise language and ecosystem such as Java or .NET been chosen, maintenance and new features would have been significantly easier, because you hit performance issues much later and understanding legacy code bases are easier even if poorly written because of the static typing, and migration between different runtime versions is first-class.<p>I see Python (or similarly, Ruby) being used at large-scale at consumer-facing businesses such as Reddit, Digg, Uber, Dropbox, etc. but many eventually integrate to a JVM based language into their production system.<p>Would you advocate for using Python as the main language in a potentially large-scale project and long running standalone project?

I&#x27;ve not followed the IT job market for that long so I cannot say whether that is the average pay for the skills in question, but even that seems outrageous. I could be wrong, of course. Some do have much more reasonable requirements, but I don&#x27;t come across too many of those.<p>Now I would expect to see people much older applying for these positions. Somewhere in the age range of &quot;Slackware in college&quot;. Instead, I see people who are 18-26 being offered - or already have - jobs in these fields[0]. I don&#x27;t mean customer service, I mean working on actual hardware for companies or developing for front&#x2F;backend.<p>How are these people getting these career deals so easily?

They are sometimes not even old enough to buy alcohol. I&#x27;d find it hard to believe that someone who just turned 20 could afford the pricing of Win Server for the experience of using and certification.

She remembered about the stock options and asked me for advice. She did not know much about the topic so I told her roughly what her options were, told her about the 90-day rule.

I first got into programming as a high school student about 20 years ago, I was fascinated by the intricacy and cleverness of it. I was reading stories of big inventions and clever hacks, such as making games fit into tiny amounts of RAM, or cutting the runtime of an algorithm in half by using a clever optimization. When software was shipped, it had to be finished, as it was damn near impossible (and very costly) to fix bugs later on. Programming was the domain of a small group of ultra smart artists who deeply cared about their craft.<p>Fast forward to 2016, and we now live in an age of radical abundance. CPU cycles, RAM and disk space are all cheaper than ice in Antarctica, and no one cares about efficiency or elegance. Software is never finished, because thanks to SaaS it never even has to leave the premises in order to be sold. We all work in two week sprints, so no one really cares about the long term impact of any code that&#x27;s written, because if it turns out to be a mistake, we can always re-write next sprint.<p>Development cycles are not driven by curiosity or need, but rather by arbitrary deadlines. Thinking deeply about a problem is out of fashion, we rather just try a bunch of random things and see which one sticks. No idea is too stupid not to try. Angel investors simply start 10 companies to get one exit. It&#x27;s the age of fast money and fast growth, none of which is sustainable.<p>Does anybody else feel that way?

I rather not say company name to maintain some anonymity since our support team is pretty small.<p>I have enjoyed my job and learned so much about practically every web stack and build suite. For the past year, I have been trying hard to get a full-time software development position. At my company, I&#x27;ve been writing some automation scripts for our production and business ops and when I have a little extra time I&#x27;ll pick up bug issues and new feature stories from our PM board that is up for grabs. Outside of work, I&#x27;ve been attending several developer meetups, taking online courses, reading books, practicing with coding challenges, and just recently began a personal RoR project.<p>My skill set so far is comprised of:\ndecent CS foundation (OOP, algorithms, comp architecture, databases), Math(calc, stats, discrete math), Web development (ruby, rails, javascript),  TDD, DevOps(linux sys admin, ansible, docker, rake, aws, heroku), as well as dabblings with Java, C, Python, Golang.<p>Unfortunately, this effort doesn&#x27;t seem like it will be enough to earn a position on my company&#x27;s dev team. Everyone on the team is a senior engineer with a minimum of 8 years of experience. The feedback I have received from the engineering manager was that I need to be able to produce code at the same level with little to no collaboration with other engineers (except for code reviews or if production is down). Realistically, I know that will take some time (several years) to achieve this, but I want to develop full-time sooner than later. Outside of work, one consistent feedback I received was that I lack coding samples&#x2F;portfolio that would warrant someone to give me an interview.<p>Thanks for reading and your potential response!","time":1482206322,"title":"Ask HN: Moving from a support role to engineering?","type":"story"},{"by":"sidcool","descendants":171,"id":13217347,"kids":[13217966,13217532,13218307,13217390,13217475,13217743,13217814,13217509,13217497,13219716,13219225,13218325,13218145,13218616,13217700,13217876,13217576,13218160,13219193,13218850,13218336,13218353,13224242,13218552,13219544,13218018,13218652,13218060,13218031,13219460,13219546,13217806,13217477,13217752,13217725,13217538,13218787,13217567,13218559],"score":254,"time":1482206294,"title":"15 years trying to make everyone separate HTML, JavaScript, CSS – and then","type":"story","url":"https://twitter.com/thomasfuchs/status/810885087214637057"},{"by":"edgarvm","descendants":244,"id":13217320,"kids":[13218124,13217714,13217472,13217827,13217748,13220652,13222047,13217461,13217831,13220155,13218183,13218274,13217471,13221692,13218455],"score":447,"time":1482205814,"title":"Solar Now Produces a Better Energy Return on Investment Than Oil","type":"story","url":"https://robertscribbler.com/2016/12/19/solar-now-produces-a-better-energy-return-on-investment-than-oil/"},{"by":"kawera","descendants":146,"id":13217195,"kids":[13219550,13219054,13220672,13218664,13218438,13219335,13219358,13221603,13223131,13220084],"score":122,"time":1482204140,"title":"If the U.S. Won't Pay Its Teachers, China Will","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-19/if-the-u-s-won-t-pay-its-teachers-china-will"},{"by":"chenster","descendants":11,"id":13217129,"kids":[13217580,13217583,13218720,13218786,13217603],"score":23,"time":1482203456,"title":"If the Moon Were Only 1 Pixel – A tediously accurate map of the solar system","type":"story","url":"http://www.joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html"},{"by":"kimsk112","descendants":66,"id":13217135,"kids":[13218517,13217245,13217602,13218953,13217485,13220109,13217462,13217384,13217446,13217511,13218677,13217354,13219655,13218103,13222650,13217376,13221662,13218204,13218994,13224782,13217227,13217249,13217248,13219047],"score":137,"time":1482203488,"title":"U.S. Startups Taking on Debt","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-19/u-s-startups-are-piling-on-debt"},{"by":"tambourine_man","descendants":607,"id":13217008,"kids":[13217134,13217181,13217243,13219660,13219000,13217205,13217437,13217894,13217241,13217162,13217101,13218074,13217278,13218087,13219020,13218348,13217117,13217054,13220358,13217146,13217936,13218202,13217289,13217075,13217091,13218875,13220827,13219991,13219474,13218582,13222660,13218978,13222165,13218872,13217865,13218054,13217929,13221234,13222786,13219995,13218139,13217064,13218553,13217759,13221214,13217822,13217230],"score":400,"time":1482202030,"title":"Tim Cook assures employees that Apple is committed to the Mac","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/19/apples-tim-cook-assures-employees-that-it-is-committed-to-the-mac-and-that-great-desktops-are-coming/"},{"by":"fmihaila","descendants":21,"id":13216968,"kids":[13217382,13217215,13217832,13217685],"score":72,"time":1482201507,"title":"Japan’s SoftBank Invests $1B in Satellite Startup OneWeb","type":"story","url":"http://www.wsj.com/articles/satellite-startup-oneweb-raises-1-2-billion-in-funding-round-led-by-softbank-1482142137"},{"by":"kafkaesq","descendants":2,"id":13216925,"kids":[13217151,13218301],"score":10,"time":1482201057,"title":"Tech CEO who allegedly hit girlfriend 117 times gets venture capital job","type":"story","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/19/gurbaksh-chahal-domestic-violence-new-job-venture-capital"},{"by":"labster","descendants":2,"id":13216924,"kids":[13217324,13217650],"score":9,"time":1482201038,"title":"Bridging the gap between Perl 5 and 6","type":"story","url":"https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2016/12/20/day-20-bridging-the-gap/"},{"by":"IMAKESTUFFOKAY","descendants":3,"id":13216878,"kids":[13217059,13216977],"score":6,"time":1482200582,"title":"New blockchain-powered free speech tool","type":"story","url":"https://steemit.com/blockchain/@woocharlie/new-blockchain-powererd-free-speech-tool"},{"by":"mw67","descendants":7,"id":13216811,"kids":[13217663,13216868,13217397,13216932],"score":7,"time":1482199692,"title":"We're in a simulation, and nobody seem to care","type":"story","url":"http://telegra.ph/Were-in-a-simulation-and-nobody-seem-to-care-12-20"},{"by":"ProgramAndroid","descendants":4,"id":13216768,"kids":[13216836,13217690,13216815],"score":2,"text":"Smartphone adoption is rising around the world.

We had heard good words about Sonatype Nexus[1] and a few days back we decided to check out their paid version of product. The impression and the experience dealing with their support team while trying to do that has been underwhelming. For one, their product page doesn&#x27;t clearly say what each product does (other than some highly abstracted words). We had a few questions about the products they offer and the features, so we sent them a mail to the email id they listed on their page. The questions were pretty basic. Their response to it was to first ask for a phone number to have a phone conversation with us. We explained to them that we prefer email conversation and then they wanted to know what company we work for etc... All we wanted was a clarification of a few questions that we asked about their product features.<p>Not really happy with this experience and we don&#x27;t really want to end up dealing with this kind of conversations if&#x2F;when we run into important issues that we might need help for, after we buy the product. To be clear, this is more about the way they tried to deal with the questions we asked, than the product itself. It was as if they were more eager to try and get more information of how big a company we were instead of trying to answer straightforward questions we asked. They did ultimately send us the answers, but it took a while to get it out of them.<p>We haven&#x27;t yet decided whether or not to use Nexus and would like to see if anyone here has any experience with other self-hosted repository management software (especially when dealing with Maven artifacts) or even their experience dealing with paid Nexus product.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sonatype.com&#x2F;products-sonatype","time":1482128236,"title":"Ask HN: Recommendations for artifacts repository management – other than Nexus?","type":"story"},{"by":"sndean","descendants":193,"id":13209575,"kids":[13209946,13209861,13209635,13210019,13209703,13209685,13209932,13209807,13209712,13209723,13210219,13209663,13210419,13211846,13210013,13209844,13209655,13210883,13210182,13210746,13209820,13211029,13210854,13210471,13210642,13209903,13210403,13209876,13211082,13210176],"score":306,"time":1482123703,"title":"The Crystal Programming Language","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal"},{"by":"tux1968","dead":true,"id":13209566,"kids":[13209916,13209580,13209573],"score":5,"time":1482123517,"title":"Due to IBM actions against OpenLava downloads have been currently disabled","type":"story","url":"http://www.openlava.org/download/download.html"},{"by":"pw","descendants":3,"id":13209533,"kids":[13212181,13217513,13212399],"score":16,"time":1482122303,"title":"Show HN: HowDoYouPronounce.org – Made with AWS Polly","type":"story","url":"http://howdoyoupronounce.org/hacker-news"},{"by":"Thevet","descendants":2,"id":13209517,"kids":[13213116,13214806],"score":35,"time":1482121912,"title":"The Spartathlon is part of the tradition of fascination with classical Greece","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/the-economist/vomit-bleeding-nipples-and-hallucinations-on-a-150-mile-running-race-fe15baa69a2a#.yxbt4h9qb"},{"by":"BuuQu9hu","descendants":42,"id":13209474,"kids":[13209823,13209849,13210429,13209863,13209888,13209482,13210034,13210022,13210290,13212061,13211808,13209922],"score":208,"time":1482120875,"title":"OpenLava under IBM attack","type":"story","url":"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/openlava-users/z4V4oF1tfdY"},{"by":"ravanpao","descendants":17,"id":13209452,"kids":[13210622,13209964,13211057,13210683,13211801,13209607,13210194,13209667,13209626,13210626],"score":94,"time":1482120472,"title":"Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris","type":"story","url":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer"},{"by":"ezekg","descendants":3,"id":13209441,"kids":[13209454,13209456],"score":3,"text":"Looking to implement something similar to what Stripe has for their API (live&#x2F;test API keys), but haven&#x27;t decided on a solid direction to take yet.

I&#x27;ve recently also been playing around with TypeScript, and was starting to like it, until the unpleasant stuff below.<p>I&#x27;m hoping that someone can point me in the right direction, or at least offer some insight to the below.<p>- NPM is great, but why are we now installing web dependencies with it? Bootstrap, Material-Components, etc. I know that there are still &quot;traditional ways&quot; of either using a CDN or downloading a local copy. I&#x27;ve avoided NPM for a while until I wanted to use Google&#x27;s Material-Components-Web thing. My confusion here&#x27;s because node_modules is private, so how do I correctly load a front-end asset by referring to node_modules?<p>- Suggestions for the above were to copy what&#x27;s installed to a public&#x2F;static folder, but NPM just spills everything all over the node_modules root now, so how would I know what depends on what?<p>- There&#x27;s been the Browserify, CommonJS, RequireJS, WebPack et al. movement, where we are now using &quot;require&quot; and &quot;import&quot; to load modules. I understand the desire to do that, but why is it so complicated for front-end? I created a simple TypeScript file under my public assets, I require&#x2F;import something, and then when I go to the browser, I get an error about require being undefined. I go to RequireJS website, and have to now learn the nuances of this library before I can get productive. Why should I have to load dozens of dependencies before loading a Hello World with some JavaScript? Is ES5 that broken?<p>While I appreciate the work that everyone&#x27;s doing with JavaScript, I really feel like we&#x27;re taking something fun and &quot;easy&quot; and complicating it. I&#x27;ve been teaching beginner programmers ES5 and earlier at work, and was planning on moving onto ES6 once I&#x27;m comfortable with the stuff I&#x27;ve been avoiding, but I&#x27;m inclined to

When someone asks about your product and you failed to get his attention in one sentence.I think you should revisit your product and make it better and strong in at least one aspect.<p>2) Have at least one big differentiating feature<p>If you have a competing product which is already popular.Doing small improvements will not make users install your app. You product should be very good in at least one thing than your competitors. Making things better is not sufficient.You can build user base on that and keep improving.<p>3) Have tools to get info on user behavior (Google analytics etc)<p>For your initial launch, you will spend more time on writing code and making the functionality work.After the launch to make improvement knowing user behavior is important. Spend more time on gathering all the events,user interactions using google analytics.

An employee hurriedly filled out her credentials in what looked like a Google Docs sign-in but was actually a hacker&#x27;s fake site. The hacker then used her credentials to steal 54 other employee passwords.<p>Current solutions to phishing are limited to forcing employees to attend training to spot these hacks and attempting to judge the URL&#x27;s reputation. People don&#x27;t have time to pay attention to every url they click. This is especially true when faced with deadlines. Even the technical systems we have in place to detect these sites rely on the URL&#x27;s reputation. This strategy fails in targeted attacks like the Exploratorium and is reactive at best.<p>I created Off The Hook to have a proactive response to phishing sites. Off The Hook is an extension that visually inspects webpages as a human would do and recognizes when pages look like valid sites. Rather than relying on reputation systems and employee training, I automated the behavior the training hoped to instill. If the page looks like a valid site but isn&#x27;t a URL that we&#x27;d expect that site to be at, then we throw a red flag and get the user out of there.

I find it hard to explain how this process works in my mind.<p>2) Use the suggestion engine of Stackoverflow: click on `Ask Question`. Type the title of your question and type your actual question. Instead of submitting the question, click on the links in the suggestion engine. Your answer is usually there. I resort to this when Google doesn&#x27;t work.<p>3) Use the search engine of Hacker News: type in the topic that you want to learn more about and look for the most upvoted tutorial. It&#x27;s very likely to be quality material. And if it isn&#x27;t quality material, then read the comments, suggestions are offered there.<p>Final note:<p>There&#x27;s probably a good YouTube&#x2F;online video strategy as well, but I wouldn&#x27;t know it.

I&#x27;m autistic, shy and depressive - which translates to toxic for any &quot;positive team oriented&quot; companies. Or more simply, all of them.<p>Companies seem to like my applications. I haven&#x27;t found it hard to get interviews, but I find it impossible to get replies after that.<p>I know I&#x27;m running out of time, and I&#x27;m getting scared because I don&#x27;t have anywhere to go after Christmas.<p>My family keep telling me I should give up and find a retail job or similar because this has been going on for months. And perhaps that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m worth honestly. Communication is important. Perhaps there isn&#x27;t a place for someone like myself in this industry.<p>I&#x27;m exhausted. I&#x27;ve worked non-stop for 10 years, and for what? I&#x27;m in a worse position than most my friends who dropped out of school. It&#x27;s a joke. A Christmas story void of all moral and meaning.<p>Rant over.<p>Merry Christmas everyone.

It took about 3 weeks to process the paperwork, and answer a lot of questions, but eventually the paperwork was signed.

That&#x27;s idiotic because it dissincentivises significant innovation, but it&#x27;s unfortunately common place.<p>To solve the dilema, companies simply need to get their greedy heads out of their rears and offer inventors a profit share percentage such as 10%.

A Q&amp;A site for passionate educators, enthusiastic teachers, and students in dire need of motivation.<p>The pain point which I’m trying to alleviate is students’ inability to recognize a real world use case for some theoretical topic in various fields of study. By creating a forum and getting teachers or experts to explain what is so cool and awesome about knowing what the student is about to learn, I’d like to motivate interest in learning the topic at hand. How does knowing it affect the decisionmaking process? With what other challenges does it help?

They are interested because they found a way to relate to it in some way.

The code is generally messy and horrible, rife with race conditions and barely holding together in parts. (Biggest: 30k LOC.) While I&#x27;m proud of my work — especially design-wise — I feel most of my time was spent on battling stupid bugs. I haven&#x27;t gained any specialist knowledge — just bloggable API experience. There&#x27;s nothing I could write a book about.<p>Meanwhile, when I compulsively dig through one-man frameworks like YapDatabase, Audiobus, or AudioKit, I am left in awe! They&#x27;re brimming with specialist knowledge. They&#x27;re incredibly documented and organized. Major features were added over the course of weeks! People have written books <i>about</i> these frameworks, and they were created by my peers — probably alongside other work. Same with one-man apps like Editorial, Ulysses, or GoodNotes.<p>I am utterly baffled by how knowledgeable and productive these programmers are. If I&#x27;m dealing with a new topic, it can take weeks to get a lay of the land, figure out codebase interactions, consider all the edge cases, etc. etc. But the commits for these frameworks show that the devs basically worked through their problems over mere days — to say nothing of getting the overall architecture right from the start. An object cache layer for SQL? Automatic code gen via YAML? MIDI over Wi-Fi? Audio destuttering? Pff, it took me like a month to add copy&#x2F;paste to my app!<p>I&#x27;m in need of some recalibration. Am I missing something? Is this quality of work the norm, or are these just exceptional programmers? And even if they are, how can I get closer to where they&#x27;re standing?

He offered to pay me fairly for my services etc and I also explained to him that I would like if there is some sort of small term contract 1 month, where I can stop working for him if I feel overwhelmed with the amount of things I&#x27;ll have to do for work and on my own time. He agreed that this is very reasonable etc.<p>Now my question to you guys is what do I do about it and do I tell to my employeer?<p>I&#x27;ve already discussed this with my director which is a  very straight forward guy and we are friends, and he told me to look online about it and that we never ever had this conversation.

As a result, i frequently google spellings of words i should know, or look up how to phrase something, etc. The little grammar and english i do know is from osmosis more than any concentrated education, and as such my education on the subject is woefully lacking.<p>So, might there be some classes to help people like me? Should i push through the sleep phase and try to read every night? Thoughts?<p><i>NOTE</i>: I&#x27;m sure i could take some classes to improve my spelling, grammar, and general understanding of the english language - but that&#x27;s not the core problem i&#x27;m trying to fix. If you think that will lead to a solution, great, but the core problem remains as wanting to speak with more clarity and ease.<p>Thank you.<p><i>(As an aside: How ironic it is that i am having trouble conveying my question.. haha)</i>","time":1481240944,"title":"Ask HN: Improving how you convey thought?","type":"story"},{"by":"beekums","descendants":6,"id":13134870,"kids":[13135328,13135195,13136697,13137215],"score":24,"text":"There&#x27;s a lot of focus around finding technical cofounders, but just because you find a technical cofounder willing to work with you doesn&#x27;t mean they have strong skills.

Especially those about remote work, company culture and doing things quite a bit differently than most other companies out there.<p>We’re originally a pure service provider. We started with app development, then integrated a web dev shop and later on extended our offering to backend development, hardware and in the recent years also medical technology. I believe we’re doing a decent job, as all our work comes by recommendation from people who’ve worked with us before and have been very happy with the result, but also the relationship with our team.<p>While we’re still pretty much focused on helping others in developing their technologies and products, we’ve also been building quite a lot of internal libraries (most of them are open source) and tools for ourselves as developers, to make our daily work a bit easier, more productive and more fun. The one product that we’ve been actively promoting and that also had quite some traction during the past 12 months is Bugfender[4]. But besides Bugfender, we have additional products in the pipeline, that work technically, but need some more cosmetic work in order to be launched to the public.<p>The dilemma we’re in right now is the following: we’ve a strong brand (“Mobile Jazz”) that is associated with a successful technology and innovation services company. But now we also see that our products (at least one of them) is having a success that we can&#x27;t ignore. From a company and team perspective I see no problem in doing both: services and products.

As an experiment, we&#x27;re going to try something new and have a cleanse. Starting today, it&#x27;s Political Detox Week on HN.<p>For one week, political stories are off-topic. Please flag them. Please also flag political threads on non-political stories. For our part, we&#x27;ll kill such stories and threads when we see them. Then we&#x27;ll watch together to see what happens.<p>Why? Political conflicts cause harm here. The values of Hacker News are intellectual curiosity and thoughtful conversation. Those things are lost when political emotions seize control. Our values are fragile—they&#x27;re like plants that get forgotten, then trampled and scorched in combat. HN is a garden, politics is war by other means, and war and gardening don&#x27;t mix.<p>Worse, these harsher patterns can spread through the rest of the culture, threatening the community as a whole. A detox week seems like a good way to strengthen the immune system and to see how HN functions under altered conditions.<p>Why don&#x27;t we have <i>some</i> politics but discuss it in thoughtful ways? Well, that&#x27;s exactly what the HN guidelines call for, but it&#x27;s insufficient to stop people from flaming each other when political conflicts activate the primitive brain. Under such conditions, we become tribal creatures, not intellectually curious ones. We can&#x27;t be both at the same time.<p>A community like HN deteriorates when new developments dilute or poison what it originally stood for. We don&#x27;t want that to happen, so let&#x27;s all get clear on what this site is for. What Hacker News is: a place for stories that gratify intellectual curiosity and civil, substantive comments.

Have been working on it for about a year in my spare time. It started out as 5 hours a week, then 10, then 20.  Right now it is demanding 30-40 hours of work per week.<p>The problem? I have a fulltime job. I cannot do awesome at both. Burnout is a very real possibility. My choices are:<p>1) Continue to fight the bootstrap fight. My calculations show that in 6 months I will reach the point where I can pay all business expenses plus my salary full time, so I can quit my dayjob. If I make it through to this other side, I have my dream. 100% of a business, and full control of my destiny.<p>2) Go raise a seed round. On a few 100k, I could hire a few employees + quit my day job, and really kickstart the entire thing. I could add 2-3x the features in the next year of what I could in #1 above.<p>3) Compromise. Somewhere between choices 1 and 2.  My projections say that for 50k I could quit my day job and make the plunge (hiring no extra staff). Then in 6-9 months, I could start to hire. It would be less stressful than #1, but slower growth than #2.  I have a few options for funding. I can pull it out of house equity, I can borrow from friends and family, or similar.<p>For a brief summary of where the project is at.. it is a b2b SAAS app. Currently bringing in $1500 per month, and has grown roughly 100% for the last 3 months ($350 -&gt; $700 -&gt; $1500). Not expecting quite that pace to continue, but I have a pretty big backlog of customers I cannot fully get going with my limited time.<p>Smart people tell me #1 is sweet.

I relocated across the country from NYC for this job around six months ago. Overall I would consider it a great move -- I&#x27;m working on an awesome project, my coworkers are amazing and have told me that my work is great, and my supervisor has told me I was a great hire. I&#x27;m fairly certain that the work I&#x27;ve done in the past six months will lead to a patent for the company and to a major feature in our main software package. No cause for concern, right?<p>Well, today, to much pomp and circumstance, the C level company execs announced year end bonuses at a company wide meeting. The execs emphasized that this year we saw record profits, and reiterated how they felt privileged to take care of <i>all</i> employees, from the staff at the company cafe to the long term, senior engineers. This success, as was emphasized, brought with it financial rewards that they were pleased to share with the feet on the ground.<p>Caught up in the hoopla, I queued up for my bonus cheque, only to find it in the amount of... around ~100 dollars, about enough money for a one way cab ride to SFO.<p>Is this cause for concern? I realize that bonuses are, by definition, a bonus, and that I should be happy for anything. But if, after this whole production, the bonus comes to around ~3% of one&#x27;s monthly rent in the bay area, that seems fucked up, especially given the state of the tech industry in the area.<p>Is this paltry bonus a cause for concern? Should I circulate my resume among friends and former colleagues in the bay? I&#x27;ve worked in similar job titles in the past, so I feel like I can, for the most part, fairly gauge my contributions to the company&#x27;s bottom line, but this seems like an intentionally bad bonus (hell, just tell everyone that new hires don&#x27;t get a bonus at all instead of giving them a rounding error).","time":1480660354,"title":"Ask HN: Insultingly Bad Bonus, Bay Area, Cause for Concern?","type":"story"},{"by":"ing33k","descendants":103,"id":13086553,"kids":[13086999,13087446,13086842,13086589,13089175,13087671,13087898,13087432,13086870,13086731,13086677],"score":158,"time":1480660096,"title":"PHP 7.1.0 Released","type":"story","url":"http://php.net/archive/2016.php#id2016-12-01-3"},{"by":"rev","descendants":2,"id":13086284,"kids":[13086291,13086933],"score":18,"time":1480656835,"title":"Rust Essentials","type":"story","url":"https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning"},{"by":"kevinbluer","descendants":131,"id":13086279,"kids":[13086907,13087237,13087702,13087032,13087183,13087270,13087760,13087369,13087191,13086808,13087529,13087743,13090601,13091859,13086901,13087718,13087192,13087061,13087928],"score":282,"time":1480656733,"title":"Confessions of an Instagram Influencer","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-11-30/confessions-of-an-instagram-influencer"},{"by":"throwaway98764","descendants":2,"id":13086177,"kids":[13113462,13086868],"score":5,"time":1480655048,"title":"Is Scopolamine the world's scariest drug?

I&#x27;m really reluctant to drop 1.5K on the .com version, but also worried&#x2F;not fully convinced about using .io or .xyz. Would really appreciate any input on this.

I know I’m not the only one having it.\nHow should I start?","time":1480354416,"title":"Ask HN: I have the dream to retire when I turn 40","type":"story"},{"by":"vonklaus","descendants":5,"id":13057520,"kids":[13058185,13058591,13057832],"score":24,"time":1480359280,"title":"Peter Thiel Insider Picked to Oversee Trump’s Defense Department Transition","type":"story","url":"https://theintercept.com/2016/11/28/peter-thiel-dod/"},{"by":"parisk","descendants":11,"id":13056869,"kids":[13057954,13062047],"score":19,"time":1480353904,"title":"Show HN: A blog on pragmatic software development","type":"story","url":"https://stateofprogress.blog/the-state-of-progress-639f3a0040af#.ngrp3j8ce"},{"by":"trojanowski","descendants":2,"id":13056724,"kids":[13068789,13066641],"score":9,"time":1480352768,"title":"Svelte: The magical disappearing UI framework","type":"story","url":"https://svelte.technology/"},{"by":"dabbott","descendants":53,"id":13056678,"kids":[13057792,13058979,13056881,13057987,13057994,13057984,13057059,13057145,13061038,13058150,13057953,13058381,13066060,13057144,13057169,13057235,13058265],"score":496,"time":1480352360,"title":"Show HN: React Native Express – Learn React Native Through Interactive Examples","type":"story","url":"http://www.reactnativeexpress.com/"},{"by":"digital55","descendants":2,"id":13056794,"kids":[13061632,13056992],"score":6,"time":1480353279,"title":"When A.I.

If you want to start down this rabbit hole search for &quot;currency collapse December 31 2016&quot; on YouTube.<p>The telltale sign that this is nation-state information warfare is that the content producers are all anonymous. Case in point: &quot;financial argument&quot; on YouTube. Nearly 100 videos, with each video having an average of around 2k views in its lifetime. Great production value and so few users that there is no way in hell the producers could make their money back on the investment.<p>Is it Russia? Most certainly because of some of the telltale signs like how Russia is always painted in a good light, especially the president. Also Russia has been running similar campaigns in the Ukraine and other Eastern European countries.\nBoth Germany and the UK have announced massive online privacy restrictions in the last few days. The timing of these restrictions now makes sense if viewed as a response toward Russians infiltration of open social media platforms and especially given the very likely possibility that Russia changed the outcome of the presidential election in favor of Trump (who was the first candidate in a century who spent less in a presidential election and WON).<p>Make no mistake, if you enjoyed your

I know that bootcamp grads are sometimes received less-than-warmly on here, so I just want to preface by saying that I didn&#x27;t change careers because I think that it&#x27;s an easy way to make a bunch of money, and I don&#x27;t expect to be competing with people with formal degrees in CS. I have a degree in an unrelated field, discovered that I love programming a couple years ago, and attended a bootcamp because making a curriculum from online materials was a laborious process.<p>Now that I&#x27;m finished with the bootcamp, I&#x27;ve been filling in some gaps in my education, tidying up projects, poking into contributing to open source projects, looking for work, and learning technologies that either seem to be in high demand or that I find interesting. As you might imagine, this is a lot of stuff, and I&#x27;ve been feeling uncertain about what I should be prioritizing.<p>In particular, I&#x27;ve been noticing a surprising amount of positions indicating that applicants should be familiar with things related to 3D graphics—WebGL libraries like three.js or Babylon.js, sometimes even Unity. I find this stuff super interesting, but didn&#x27;t expect to see it in these job descriptions and have little personal experience with it. I&#x27;d be happy to put some time into learning it, but only if that time is going to be well-spent re: short-term employability. If you were in my shoes, would you be learning WebGL? If so, what resources would you be using?<p>Secondly, more broadly, what would you be studying in general in my position? I understand that in my position I should probably mostly be focused on front-end positions. For those positions, should I just be drilling down into JS and leaving other languages for the future?

MA&#x27;s divorce and alimony laws are pretty straight forward (if arguably unfair in many circumstances...), and I will end up paying ~32.5% of the delta of our incomes for ~8 years as alimony.  In addition to that, we split all current assets 50&#x2F;50.<p>That includes my shares of the company.  We have a recent valuation done which indicates some significant value.  If I got another valuation done for this divorce i could probably present data that would push that down, however she could also get her own done and I&#x27;m sure push the value up, so we&#x27;ve agreed to the existing valuation (for now).  MA doesn&#x27;t allow for the normal &quot;discounts&quot; for divorce (lack of control, and lack of marketability) so in theory I owe her 50% of the theoretical value of my shares.  I don&#x27;t have that kind of money, and I have no way to actually turn my shares into cash.  So it seems like I&#x27;m going to end up owing her a large amount of money.<p>If she &quot;lets&quot; me pay that amount off, interest free, over the term of the alimony (8 years), then I will be working my usual high stress 50-60 hours&#x2F;week keeping my company going, and my wife will end up with approximately 2x the money I do, for the next 8 years.  I would also be legally prohibited from just quitting and working as a mechanic (or some other lower stress lower paying job).<p>I don&#x27;t think I can do that (mentally&#x2F;emotionally&#x2F;morally).<p>Has anyone been through anything similar or have any advice?  My (very highly respected and expensive) attorney unfortunately feels that the MA law is super simple and I&#x27;m basically just screwed.
