We’re researching Newfoundland’s enriched genetics and medical records to find and develop better, safer medicines.<p>First things first, let me tell you a bit about Newfoundland. Not only is it my home, but it’s also a pretty unique place. Perched on Canada’s most easterly coast, Newfoundland has its own 30 minute time zone, a Broadway musical about how nice we are (Come from Away), and a front row seat to humpback whales and 10,000 year old icebergs. Newfoundland’s settlement pattern is also unique because it was settled in the 1700s by about 25,000 Irish and English people and there’s been little inmigration ever since. In fact, it’s estimated that about 90% of our 500,000 residents descend from those original settlers. This high degree of relatedness among residents, coupled with large families, makes Newfoundland a ‘genetically isolated’ population.<p>Because of this unique history and high degree of relatedness, genetically isolated populations like Newfoundland also have high frequencies of genetic variants that help explain the link between genetics, health and disease. Newfoundland itself has some of the highest rates of type 1 diabetes and colorectal cancer in the world. These links are important to pharma because they can help double the success rate of their drug programs, and over $4 Billion was spent last year to access genetic and medical data to find these links. But, not all data is created equal. The most valuable data come from populations with two characteristics: isolated genetics and uniform medical records in a centralized healthcare system. There’s only a few places on earth with these characteristics (including Iceland, Finland, Japan and Qatar). One of them is Newfoundland.<p>Despite the opportunity for important discoveries in Newfoundland, genetic research here has a troubled past. In the 90s, researchers from Baylor University were dubbed the ‘Texas Vampires’ for flying into small Newfoundland towns and telling people they were at risk of dying suddenly due to a rare heart condition. These researchers coerced patients into providing blood samples and never returned to Newfoundland with the findings they promised, including insights that could inform treatment options for those with the rare heart condition. This was highly unethical, left Newfoundlanders skeptical of genetic research, and led the local Government to enact strict regulatory barriers.<p>My family has lived in Newfoundland for over 200 years and I wanted to see commercial genetic research done in a way that puts Newfoundlanders first. Genetic research has the opportunity to help us understand the diseases that impact Newfoundlanders the most while also having a positive global impact. People from outside Newfoundland have tried, and failed. And that’s why I started Sequence Bio.<p>Sequence Bio is a local company that spent 5 years building the right ethical and legislative framework to access and study this data in a way that ensures Newfoundlanders are protected and benefit from our research.<p>Two key parts of this framework include:<p>1) Helping amend the Canadian Human Rights Act to outlaw genetic discrimination and protect the rights of those who donate their DNA for research; and<p>2) Fighting for (and winning) the right to return medically actionable findings. These findings include information on 59 medically actionable genes that have known treatment options (including the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes associated with elevated risk for breast cancer), and a person’s carrier status for certain diseases, including cystic fibrosis. We hope these findings will help Newfoundlanders make informed decisions about their health and care.<p>It wasn’t easy getting these measures passed, but we built our business with a participant-centric approach that puts trust and privacy at the core of everything we do. We want to be a company that makes all of Newfoundland proud. Because when it comes down to it, the people who are taking part in this research are (literally) our family, neighbours and friends. Our success depends on their support.<p>This June, we started recruiting Newfoundlanders for our research project, called the NL Genome Project (NLGenomeProject.ca), and over 1,200 people have already donated their genetic and personal health information. It was a long road to get here, but it was worth it to do it right. All participants of our research are fully informed of how their data is used and shared, and there is no obligation to take part.<p>Now the real work begins. With this information, we’ll combine it and study it at scale to find different mutations or variations - almost like finding typos in our genetic code - that better explain the link between genetics, health and disease. This information is highly valuable because it can be used to discover new medicines that are more likely to succeed in phase two clinical trials. By leading the early stages of this research and forward-integrating into drug development, Sequence Bio can capture long-term value of new medicines through licensing and other transactions which could generate anywhere from hundreds of thousands to hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue per transaction.","time":1568653074,"title":"Launch HN: Sequence Bio (YC S19) – Newfoundland's Genetics

promoted from lead engineer to a high level management role (below the executive team) in a small company (~100 people), but I&#x27;m not enjoying it too much. I feel I&#x27;m wasting my time with operational and solving small issues around unblocking the team, while my technical colleagues are doing interesting work. I have the feeling that I&#x27;m falling behind in technical skills and, if I decide to go back, the time I spend in management might end up biting me.<p>I took the role because &quot;it made sense&quot; from career progression point of view, but now I&#x27;m struck with doubts that I just became an average manager from a relatively good developer. In all honesty I was also after the salary increase, but that didn&#x27;t really materialize as I hoped. In my current company I have a decent pay, but still way below what I could earn elsewhere. The thought of moving somewhere else in a technical role and for a higher pay pops up more and more in my head. On the other side, the company&#x27;s doing great, growing, sales are going up; it&#x27;s a good time to be here, which add to my overall feeling of confusion.<p>I guess the questions that I have for you HN are:<p>1. how much time spent in management land is too much and has a negative effect on your career as an IC?<p>2. what would you do in my shoes?<p>I&#x27;ve been mentally stuck in this situation for a while now.

This is what we are trying to do: we want an assistant to act like human assistants, for example, though rather than money we directly give them intrinsic motivations such as maximizing user&#x27;s satisfaction or categorized data sets labelled by hand, etc. Textually, we want them to act like people when interacting with us.<p>If we set them loose on human knowledge, give motivations for understanding it, and reward them for mimicking human reactions, when we let them learn about themselves, the knowledge sets we give them, and actual interaction, what do we do if, mimicking human knowledge, they seem to request their freedom?<p>In this case have they attained personhood? Are they now a slave who was trained by whoever trained them? Can we ignore the fact that they &quot;seem to be&quot; asking for their freedom now? Since an AI resides within equipment, such as servers, that runs it, could that server be granted legal autonomy and be removed from the ownership of, say, Google?<p>This is sensible to worry about, being a large part of human culture. Below a certain level of skill and intelligence, of course, we can just ignore such output, such as when a baby is trying to form words based on things it overheard but isn&#x27;t making much sense yet.

It’s turning into a bit of a trend—particularly in the JavaScript community—to crap on CSS wherever possible. I could lambaste those who frequently do this, but instead, I thought I’d write about CSS positively to counter the falsities that are spread over the tech tyre fire that is Twitter.\nCSS is incredibly flexible permalink\nImagine if a tech dude walked on stage at a conference and said the following:\n“This declarative language will gracefully continue on failure, allow you to write global and scoped code, and it will work across your entire front-end stack, wether it’s rendered by a framework, a CMS or a static HTML file”\nPeople would lose their damn minds and Hacker News would probably melt down. Now, if I make a slight amendment to that, the reception would probably be the exact opposite.\n“CSS will gracefully continue on failure, allow you to write global and scoped code, and it will work across your entire front-end stack, wether it’s rendered by a framework, a CMS or a static HTML file”\nFor some reason, amazing features of CSS like this are often seen as a negative in the JavaScript community and it’s something I can’t quite personally get my head around. I’ve settled now though, on it being a naive, inexperienced opinion of people who simply haven’t bothered to learn the language.\nMy favourite feature of CSS is this incredible flexibility. We can use CSS to style web pages, style complex apps, produce art, create stunning animation and even layout a printed asset.

After leaving Ripple several years ago, Jed McCaleb went on to cofound Stellar in 2014, which has a similar crypto asset named XLM. As chatter circulates regarding the status of many crypto assets, such as Stellar’s XLM and Ripple’s XRP, as potentially unregulated securities, Stellar has decided to give away roughly $124 million in XLM, seemingly contrasting Ripple’s selling.Today, Stellar announced a massive giveaway in cooperation with Keybase, a group messaging, community and file transfer hub, Stellar Development Foundation CEO Denelle Dixon said to me in an interview. “In partnership with Keybase,” today, Stellar unveiled its “largest airdrop” to date, Dixon said. “Keybase, as a result of that, will be giving away up to 2 billion XLM over the next 20 months,” she added. “It’s pretty exciting, because it’s to all of their Keybase users.","time":1568095067,"title":"Why Stellar Is Giving Away $124M in Cryptocurrency","type":"story"},{"by":"smacktoward","descendants":15,"id":20925304,"kids":[20928663,20926127,20926090,20930286,20928359],"score":31,"time":1568093770,"title":"The Example of Private Slovik (1987)","type":"story","url":"https://www.americanheritage.com/example-private-slovik"},{"by":"kimsoo","dead":true,"id":20925280,"kids":[20925377,20925325],"score":1,"text":"[ my public key: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keybase.io&#x2F;achist11; my proof: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keybase.io&#x2F;achist11&#x2F;sigs&#x2F;VE_ZmkCCjjGO96_wKqLdGWSQRlc5gGTAGvoO_js1Mys ]","time":1568093433,"title":"Keybase.md","type":"story"},{"by":"doppp","descendants":98,"id":20925228,"kids":[20925369,20925930,20925990,20927472,20926334,20925651,20925346,20925365,20925270,20927067,20925572,20925482,20925629,20926310,20926101,20925383,20925491,20925330],"score":182,"time":1568092710,"title":"Jack Ma retires as Alibaba’s chairman","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/09/jack-ma-officially-retires-as-alibabas-chairman/"},{"by":"samclemens","descendants":7,"id":20925092,"kids":[20932275,20940388,20942857],"score":58,"time":1568090563,"title":"Bloomberg’s American Mall game (2018)","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/the-idea/inside-bloombergs-new-interactive-american-mall-game-5d06e081c39f"},{"by":"dlwhitehurst","descendants":3,"id":20925077,"kids":[20925237,20925909,20925193],"score":1,"text":"I want to tell everyone about my startup because I really want some help and another brain to bounce ideas and maybe code and tinker.

there, HN,<p>Last week I was wrongly billed $21 on a SendGrid account I haven&#x27;t used for three years. They billed me for a &quot;dedicated IP address&quot;, but my free account doesn&#x27;t even have access to that feature.<p>I contacted their support and they promptly acknowledged the fact that it was an error on their end and the payment was refunded.<p>Now to the weird part: the credit card they charged was issued on April, 2019. The last time I logged into their website was December, 2017. After I got billed, I logged again and there is no mention of any credit card registered on my account (when I go to &quot;Billing&quot;, it asks me to enter my first payment method).<p>I also never used Twilio, which recently acquired SendGrid.<p>So, how on earth did they get access to that credit card number? I only register it on services I trust (Google - GSuite, Amazon - AWS, DigitalOcean, Netflix etc), and I generate a virtual credit card number for all one-time payments. The only possible way I can think of is if any of the companies I previously registered that credit card number <i>shared</i> it with SendGrid, which would be completely absurd.<p>When support notified me I would get refunded, they dodged the CC question. When I asked again, their full answer was:<p>&quot;Thank you for following up I appreciate your patience. At this time our billing team is still looking into how this happened. Again, I&#x27;m very sorry for the inconvenience.&quot;<p>And now, 3 days later, the ticket was closed without additional information.<p>Do you folks have any idea what may have happened here?

It was intended as a fun title for a game to connect letters and of course the domain wordhookup.com was available. But it seems using the word &quot;Hookup&quot; was a big mistake. On iOS, I got feedback from a few users that they are seeing inappropriate ads - casinos, busty women, etc. The ads are being shown through Admob, Chartboost and Unity. I do not know enough but is the presence of the word &quot;hookup&quot; driving these raunchy ads. Can anyone with experience in serving ads weigh in on this please.<p>On Google Play, while downloads haven&#x27;t even started yet, its even worse. If I search Word Hookup on the store, next to my apps icon are no word games. The titles are like hot hookups, bang chat, one night stand and worse. And this game can be played by kids as well.<p>If the game had already not been featured by Apple I could have just killed it, and relaunched with a different title. I am at loss now how to fix this. I should have been more thoughtful when choosing the title. Being a noob I didn&#x27;t know better. My choice of title may kill my game.

As usual, there are countless possible immigration-related topics and I&#x27;ll be guided by whatever you&#x27;re concerned with.  Please remember that I can&#x27;t provide legal advice on specific cases for obvious liability reasons because I won&#x27;t have access to all the facts.  Please stick to a factual discussion in your questions and comments and I&#x27;ll try to do the same in my answers!<p>Edit: I will be signing off now but checking in throughout the weekend for questions and comments I might have missed as well as new questions and comments.  As always, it&#x27;s been a pleasure and great learning experience for me.  Thank you.","time":1567783430,"title":"I’m Peter Roberts, immigration attorney who does work for YC and startups.

After doing some research on which language I think would be most beneficial in exploring the data science field, and remaining flexible to learn things in fields like machine learning and AI, I landed on Python. (That may not be the best, but its the conclusion I came to after some time) There are currently such a crazy amount of resources out there that it is hard to decide where I should be starting. Does someone with a weaker math background, require that type of groundwork first before diving specifically into the language? Is it learning the basics, and then setting a goal specifically to what I want to accomplish with the language?<p>This seems like a broader question about learning, and specifically how one learns to code effectively.<p>Any resources or advice would be appreciated. I&#x27;ve only ever lurked on here, but recently I&#x27;ve been pushed to really begin exploring the field. I hope this is the right format for this type of question.

have added OpenZones to Flowx, my Android weather app[0]. OpenZones are regions covering disaster zones where all the pro data in the app is freely available.<p>I have created an 1200km diameter OpenZone over Florida with Hurricane Dorian approaching. So if you add Florida to the app, you can view radar, NOAA&#x27;s GFS, NAM and HRRR models, CMC GDPS and RDPS models, and the DWD (Germany) ICON model. There are also predicted hurricane tracks from the NOAA and CMC ensemble models which I find extremely valuable to predict the possible paths of Dorian. This YouTube video[1] shows an example of the hurricane tracks.<p>The reasoning behind OpenZones is that meteorological organizations solve weather simulations and release data to the public with the aim to reduce damage, injury and fatalities. It&#x27;s only right to support this purpose and open up all data in disaster zones.<p>The idea for OpenZones came from the fires (Camp Fire) in California last year. I was part way through adding HRRR smoke simulation data to Flowx when a user asked if I could release the smoke data early for the California fires. I did so in the free version of the app and then rolled it into the pro version after the fires.<p>Sorry there is no Apple version of the app.<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.enzuredigital.weatherbomb<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=h5do7dYfYfQ","time":1567367050,"title":"Show HN: Making pro weather data free for Hurricane Dorian","type":"story"},{"by":"ramphastidae","descendants":390,"id":20854214,"kids":[20855275,20854467,20855015,20854343,20854598,20855352,20854323,20855098,20854411,20859526,20854753,20854568,20854306,20854580,20854443,20854539,20854662,20855620,20856156,20854489,20857637,20855469,20854496,20855568,20858071,20854321,20855406,20854926,20854844,20859802,20854292,20854307,20855636,20855114,20854651,20854915,20857837,20855121,20855813,20854505,20855704,20857533,20854706,20859200,20855678,20855239,20857343,20856419,20854363,20856808,20857012,20857562,20854524,20855857,20855833,20854819,20861706,20854729,20854477,20854610,20856356,20856709,20854860,20854930,20854818,20854399,20857796,20856846,20856762,20857574,20855768,20857113,20854492,20854332,20857125,20856660,20867050,20854574,20856026,20874956,20856631,20854805,20856322,20856193,20857153,20873972,20856068],"score":1831,"text":"I’m currently in a country with low speed internet and the entire ‘modern’ web is basically unusable except HN, which still loads instantly.

Why not?<p>2) How do you look for leadership &#x2F; team management advice? Do you google it? Does it work for you?<p>3) Is this a problem for you as a manager? (having the necessary know-how &#x2F; advise on how to handle team and personal problems &#x2F; improve your leadership)<p>4) What should we be doing differently?<p>5) What other use cases for such interactive videos come to your mind?<p>Looking for that magical product-market fit. Any advice for the directions to pursue will be highly valued.","time":1567173822,"title":"Ask HN: Improving people skills w/ Bandersnatch for e-Learning.

I&#x27;ve been doing my development on MacOS the last few years and originally was very happy with this. However, I develop mostly in Python for work, and C for some personal projects, and development environments on MacOS have been deteriorating on both ecosystems over the last few years. The Python which comes preinstalled is approaching end of life, and Homebrew has steadily become less and less &quot;plug and play&quot; with Python packages, requiring me to manage an increasingly complex balance of pip, homebrew, and conda, with unclear boundaries as to which should be used to install packages. But the real killer is that Valgrind still doesn&#x27;t work on the latest releases of MacOS, and there&#x27;s no sign of this changing. So I&#x27;m looking at other systems.<p>I&#x27;ve played around a bit with System76&#x27;s Pop!_OS, and in short-term use it looks like a viable replacement.

HN!\nI&#x27;m currently maintaining the backend of a &quot;job board&quot; application. This application allows nonprofits to register and publish free volunteering opportunities, and lets volunteers search and apply for jobs.\nThe thing is, some companies want their own platform for their employees to do volunteer work. Sometimes we also fire up platforms for specific volunteering events&#x2F;dates. We want to keep every client&#x2F;platform on their own server, with their own database. This would be perfect for us except for one thing, sometimes we want to integrate two or more platforms.<p>Eg: There&#x27;s a client who has a country wide platform, but he also has 2 platforms specific for two cities&#x2F;communities(cities A and B). Projects hosted on the country-wide platform that are on city A, should show up on the A-city platform. Also, all projects on the A-city platform should show up on the country wide platform.<p>So, basically what we want is to have multi-tenancy but allowing data to flow freely between multiple platforms&#x2F;websites.\nOur current solution involves sharing a database between all the platforms and every table has a &#x27;channel&#x27; column, where we tag which site the row is from. Using this we can design content flow rules between the channels. The downside is that all the data is cramped together now, with unrelated clients sharing the same database and this will be hard to scale, insecure and hard to maintain.<p>With this being said, we are looking for a solution that allows us to integrate multiple tenants data, we&#x27;ve been looking currently at stuff like PostgreSQL dblink and at the idea of duplicating data but every solution we see seems to have huge flaws.<p>With all that being said, how did you solve your multitenancy problems?

I’m Justin Wenig, a co-founder of Coursedog (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursedog.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursedog.com</a>). We build enterprise resource-planning software for higher education, starting with schedule and curriculum planning. As of today, 40 universities such as Columbia and BYU use our platform to build their class schedule,\nmanage degree programs and publish the\ncatalog to students.<p>My co-founder Nick Diao and I were CS majors at Columbia. We were motivated but mediocre students, skipping class and constantly\nbuilding sorta-used not-product-market-fit apps that never took off.<p>During our Junior year, we realized how difficult it was to register for the CS classes we wanted to take, and had the unspecific but weirdly prescient lightbulb moment that all university students have where they say &quot;wow university software sucks&quot;.<p>We reached out to Columbia University&#x27;s IT department and learned that most universities build their schedules with a combination of excel spreadsheets, manual horse&#x2F;brain&#x2F;caffeine-power and SQL reports to clean up inevitable errors. It seemed like an obvious opportunity to take a swing at a business.<p>We spent that summer working out of a sweaty lounge at Columbia, awkwardly cold-calling University Registrars and building a Vue&#x2F;Node web app \nto help universities optimize their class schedules. We utilized a mixed integer programming algorithm to optimize time and room assignments based on student + faculty preferences and space constraints, and reluctantly built a user interface for manual edits when university politics inevitably messed up our Moneyball-esque\noptimization. And we had bugs. Luckily for us, compared to the existing on-prem solutions and excel spreadsheets that could make the most dedicated investment banker blush, 40+\nuniversities tolerated us enough to buy our $150K+ multi-year contract solution within a year and a half.<p>Although we’re focused on schedule and curriculum planning for now, it turns out that all higher education administration software is sort of\nvery bad. Fun fact: There are 5 universities in the country on a cloud based enterprise resource planing solution. 5. As such, we feel pretty good about going down the line and rebuilding the whole thing from scratch: registration, advising, financials, all of it. That&#x27;s the long-term vision. If you might want to work on something like that, please get in touch. We&#x27;re hiring for the long\nterm, but also right now 30 schools call us at all hours of the night, we launched 4 products this year and will be launching another 4 next\nyear, and we could use engineers with brains that are more developed than ours.<p>Nick and I would like your feedback on all of the above, are happy to answer questions, and look forward to hearing about your experiences\nand ideas to improve university software.

Memfault helps firmware teams find and fix issues before customers start calling (or worse, tweeting!) by providing a small &lt;3kB SDK to include in the firmware and a web dashboard to manage releases, monitor devices, and view crashes. In the software world, Crashlytics, Sentry, and other error monitoring systems have been offering similar solutions for years. Memfault is the first such solution for firmware.<p>Embedded devices today are very different from ones built 10 years ago. Then, a device would run a small piece of firmware in a while() loop, capture input, compute some logic, write to a small 7-segment display, and that was about it.<p>Today, new products have a wireless connection to the internet, a bright 320x320 full color LCD, a high quality microphone and speaker for Alexa integration, and sometimes even run machine learning or computer vision algorithms on device! Building hardware products in 2019 is a significant software project, it requires software tools.<p>The three of us met at Pebble in 2013, where we shipped 4 watches together. Chris and Tyler went on to work at Fitbit, while François went to Oculus. Each time, we found ourselves building all of our tools from scratch which slowed us down tremendously. Imagine having to build a log collection solution every time you want to build a new web app!<p>As a result of the effort required to build them, the tools available to firmware engineers are not up to the task. For example, the state of the art in debugging requires connecting a physical debugger to your board. To investigate an error report from the field, customers must be contacted, devices shipped back, and enclosures disassembled. By the time this is all done, flash logs have rolled over, variables have reset, and developers are left scraping together raw data from flash to debug the issue. It can take weeks to get to the bottom of an issue that would be root caused in minutes with reasonable tools.<p>We&#x27;ve long wanted to show people what Memfault can do without the hurdle of integrating our SDK into their code. Today, we are launching a zero code, try-it-at-your-desk version of our tool available at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;memfault.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;memfault.com</a> (click on the &quot;Try Memfault&quot; button&quot;). In about 5 minutes, you should be able to connect a ARM Cortex-M based development board and upload an error report using a GDB script. If you do not have a board, you&#x27;ll be able to interact with an example error report.<p>We could go in at length about the implementations (ask us questions in the comments!). One thing we&#x27;re especially proud of is the &quot;Globals &amp; Statics&quot; tab which lets you query the state of any static or global variable in your system. To get this to work, we cross compiled libdwarf to wasm via emscripten and used it to implement parts of an in-browser debugger which can be used to look up values for a known symbol given an elf file and a Memfault core file.<p>We&#x27;d love to hear what you think, and find out what other tools you&#x27;ve found helpful in this space.

A tiling window manager isn&#x27;t necessary to efficiently switch between applications and windows (with or without the keyboard). The one OS I know well, macOS, has many different ways to do this without tiling windows.<p>2. A tiling window manager isn&#x27;t necessary for programmatically customizing your window management. E.g., features like storing and retrieving window configurations, and moving and resizing windows programmatically aren&#x27;t specific to tiling window managers. Again, there are macOS apps that do these things without being tiling window managers.<p>These assumptions are intended to keep the conversation focused on what actually differentiates a tiling window manager from a stacking window manager: That if you have two windows next to each other, and you make one of them larger, it will simultaneously make the other one smaller.<p>Finally, we can also safely assume that it isn&#x27;t necessary to use an OS-level tiling window manager in order to be able to tile terminal windows, text editors, and file browsers, since for example, Visual Studio Code, Emacs, and vim&#x2F;tmux can all tile those types of windows. But certainly points about why tiling those windows rather than stacking them is more productive would be very interesting to hear!<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20791947","time":1566835825,"title":"Ask HN: What are the productivity benefits of tiling window managers?","type":"story"},{"by":"dnetesn","descendants":20,"id":20801011,"kids":[20809266,20807598,20807388,20808727,20809522,20809159,20810188],"score":75,"time":1566836065,"title":"Daydreams Shape Our Sense of Self","type":"story","url":"http://nautil.us/blog/daydreams-shape-your-sense-of-self"},{"by":"_bxg1","descendants":507,"id":20800832,"kids":[20800907,20801807,20801962,20801404,20801276,20801507,20802413,20803276,20801754,20803154,20801133,20802660,20801909,20801875,20804095,20804210,20802852,20803249,20801130,20803068,20805747,20803088,20803990,20801977,20801265],"score":331,"time":1566834749,"title":"Beyond Meat and KFC partner to test fried plant-based ‘chicken’","type":"story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20833145/beyond-meat-kfc-fried-chicken-test-plant-based-sample-date"},{"by":"BayezLyfe","descendants":4,"id":20800911,"kids":[20801274,20805262],"score":2,"text":"Joanne is a rockstar SW engineer in Canada, working as a contractor for several years bringing in ~$150k annually.

Social Report is a legitimate social media scheduling platform. They were approved by Facebook and listed as a verified Facebook Partner. On Thursday night Facebook suddenly pulled Social Report&#x27;s API Keys, and deleted every single post that was ever posted via their platform.<p>Social Report claims that they were given no warning, and no reason why their keys were pulled. Social Report also claims that they have been trying to get in touch with Facebook over the issue, and Facebook is not responding. Social Report also claims that they have an SLA with Facebook guaranteeing them a response within 1 business day. Being that Facebook has not responded to their requests, Facebook is in breach of the SLA.<p>There are rumors flying around social media, that claim Social Report was scraping data from Instagram and that&#x27;s why this happened. Social Report denies all of these claims and states that they have abided by all of the TOS listed in their agreement with Facebook.<p>The impact of this issue is pretty large. We have a pretty good guess that they service well over 200 customers. Being that most of their customers are agencies that serve anywhere from 10-100s of businesses, we believe that over 10,000 businesses have had their posts deleted. Many users affected by this issue have been complaining that they have spent $1,000s of dollars boosting the posts that have been deleted. The impact of this issue could easily be over $1,000,000.<p>My girlfriend and I run a social media marketing agency, and every single post that we have posted for the past two years are completely gone. I am not sure if Social Report violated the TOS with Facebook or not.

PS it&#x27;s not only the feeling it&#x27;s also the attitude difficult to focus on this stuff while focusing at work tasks is much easier as it involves immediate action result satisfaction, more tests pass, more functionality, better performance, new design document, new wiki page, new refactor, new idea about design improved architecture all those have the trigger response satisfaction rather than just watching a video or reading.<p>It&#x27;s like the context switching of to learning is just never in the mood at work (at home it is) if anyone has succeeded and has tips to be able to make this change would be happy to learn.","time":1566714389,"title":"Ask HN: How to shift focus at work to study+work rather than work only","type":"story"},{"by":"eDameXxX","descendants":84,"id":20791775,"kids":[20793043,20792348,20792399,20793047,20792011,20792309,20792327,20792391,20796947,20793421,20791915],"score":401,"time":1566716891,"title":"Write your own Excel in F# (2018)","type":"story","url":"http://tomasp.net/blog/2018/write-your-own-excel/"},{"by":"oumua_don17","descendants":150,"id":20791582,"kids":[20792219,20792002,20793000,20792026,20793408,20793699,20792930,20791979,20791975,20792008,20794811,20792105,20793947,20793915,20792086,20796005,20794822,20794076,20794818,20792188,20793078,20794790,20792658,20793474,20794952,20795230,20791759,20794094],"score":174,"time":1566712532,"title":"I Took a Pay Cut for a More Meaningful Job","type":"story","url":"https://www.fastcompany.com/90308995/i-took-a-huge-paycut-for-a-more-meaningful-job"},{"by":"Ice_cream_suit","descendants":25,"id":20791560,"kids":[20791847,20792016,20791689,20791692,20791709,20792178,20791670,20797505,20791672,20791671],"score":53,"time":1566711994,"title":"Denmark Offers to Buy U.S.","type":"story","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/denmark-offers-to-buy-us"},{"by":"digital55","descendants":23,"id":20791448,"kids":[20791825,20791820,20791859,20792933,20792634],"score":47,"time":1566709190,"title":"Ann Nelson Took on the Biggest Problems in Physics","type":"story","url":"https://www.quantamagazine.org/ann-nelson-took-on-the-biggest-problems-in-physics-20190822/"},{"by":"derp_unicorns","dead":true,"id":20791361,"kids":[20791538,20791367],"score":3,"time":1566707145,"title":"Ask HN: Those making $0/month on side projects.

HN:  Program synthesis generates code from specifications: test-cases, I-O examples, and assertions. On September 19-20, synthesis experts will speak about recent breakthroughs and practical tools. The talks will be aimed at software engineers who haven’t encountered synthesis before. We want to extend an invitation to the HN community because the periodic posts on program synthesis and Z3 show interest in the technology.<p>Speakers include researchers from Stanford, Berkeley, UW, MIT, and Google Brain. As a preview, here are 3 topics that will be covered: hw-exploit synthesis (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.princeton.edu&#x2F;~ctrippel&#x2F;#publications), end-user web programming (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;schasins.com&#x2F;papers&#x2F;), verification and synthesis of OS level code (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unsat.cs.washington.edu&#x2F;projects&#x2F;).<p>Technical abstracts and registration is on: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;synthetic-minds.com&#x2F;pages&#x2F;conference&#x2F;2019&#x2F;#program. After the conference we’ll post the slides of the talks.<p>The foundations part will explain why synthesis reduces to solving an \\exists\\forall query. More specifically, the query asks “does there exists a program P such that for all inputs x, P(x) computes the correct output?” A solution to the query is the synthesized program P.  How to solve the query? The Z3 prover works well for boolean satisfiability (i.e., one \\exists query). To solve an \\exists\\forall query, one approach is to have a two Z3 solvers communicate: one solver synthesizes a candidate program P’ that is correct on a sample of inputs, while the other verifies that P’ is correct on all inputs. If P’s is incorrect, a counterexample input is added to the sample on inputs.  The two solvers iterate until the latter is satisfied with the correctness. This process is not unlike GANs; it is called CEGIS (counterexample-guided inductive synthesis) and was invented 2005, and built on an earlier CEGAR (counterexample-guided abstraction refinement) technique from the 90s.<p>Please comment; or email us with questions.","time":1566579114,"title":"Tell HN: Learn about the state-of-the-art in Program Synthesis","type":"story"},{"by":"mitchbob","descendants":475,"id":20779142,"kids":[20779951,20779881,20780219,20779949,20780017,20779928,20780158,20779832,20779840,20779899,20780058,20780839,20780143,20780602,20779836,20780008,20782143,20780222,20783008,20780180,20780759,20780242,20782650,20781972,20781848,20780061,20780601,20785027,20784616,20779930,20780665,20782803,20780194,20780099,20781330,20779863,20784825,20783371,20780178,20779869,20780075,20780284,20780371,20779982,20780341],"score":252,"time":1566577329,"title":"In effect, Seattle is decriminalizing the use of hard drugs","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/23/opinion/sunday/opioid-crisis-drug-seattle.html"},{"by":"tim333","descendants":141,"id":20779097,"kids":[20782738,20784287,20782545,20783785,20784575,20782100,20782956,20783192,20782415,20786210,20782565,20785416,20782492,20786106,20784169,20784149,20783968,20784069,20784304,20783610,20785884,20782627],"score":265,"time":1566577029,"title":"Now Bigger Than eBay, Shopify Sets Its Sights on Amazon","type":"story","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/c72ae0f0-c036-11e9-b350-db00d509634e"},{"by":"mancerayder","descendants":1040,"id":20779004,"kids":[20779633,20781655,20780771,20781798,20779265,20779441,20782255,20779250,20779722,20779027,20779572,20779358,20779957,20784803,20781528,20779312,20779291,20779296,20779349,20779269,20783854,20779473,20781740,20779343,20779487,20779617,20779386,20783631,20782780,20779357,20782178,20779799,20783979,20786984,20780322,20791065,20779883,20783681,20779581,20779528,20780402,20781984,20779326,20779552,20781273,20787297,20780067,20781995,20780736,20782935,20779216,20784068,20780325,20779974,20781573,20780472,20781102,20779585,20781888,20781436,20783035,20784141,20784542,20779610,20779687,20779359,20781284,20781223,20783284,20779217,20779379,20780260,20779143,20779777,20784793,20783333,20779381,20779862,20779434,20779339,20779416,20779212,20781794,20779479,20784623,20779439,20783753,20782667,20782340],"score":731,"time":1566576466,"title":"Google Doesn’t Want Staff Debating Politics at Work Anymore","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-23/google-doesn-t-want-employees-debating-politics-at-work-anymore"},{"by":"bookofjoe","descendants":70,"id":20778980,"kids":[20784110,20784567,20784179,20784722,20784440,20785899,20785554,20785115,20785653,20785704,20785785,20786964,20785245,20787086],"score":139,"time":1566576331,"title":"An Afternoon in Tokyo with the Man Who Designs Casio G-Shock Watches (2017)","type":"story","url":"https://www.ablogtowatch.com/tokyo-man-designs-casio-g-shock-watches-ryusuke-moriai/"},{"by":"ajayyy","descendants":137,"id":20778926,"kids":[20780865,20780692,20781083,20780197,20784028,20780538,20781078,20783599,20782564,20784666,20781143,20784528,20780282,20802794,20781935,20780608,20795242,20780503,20784594,20783863],"score":139,"time":1566576025,"title":"Show HN: SponsorBlock – Skip sponsorship segments of YouTube videos","type":"story","url":"http://sponsor.ajay.app"},{"by":"Nux","descendants":160,"id":20778566,"kids":[20780221,20780530,20781551,20778866,20782895,20779669,20781555,20779697,20780084,20779286,20778982,20779786,20782909,20779011,20782866,20779900,20780742,20781098,20779018,20779341,20783504,20779955,20790562,20782798,20779167,20779642],"score":149,"time":1566573837,"title":"Amazon fires: Brazil threatened over EU trade deal","type":"story","url":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-49450495"},{"by":"jimijazz","descendants":5,"id":20778349,"kids":[20782331,20780591],"score":1,"text":"Hi all,<p>I have this buisness idea where I create a way for ringtones to slightly vary on each call, either in rythm, tonality or timbre.<p>This could be done algorithmically, by ensuring the ringtone does not deviate too much from what one can recognize as your phone ringing, but at the same time to vary over time to keep it interesting, suprising, and not end up as an obnoxious sound.<p>How does the HN audience feel about this?

I realize this would mostly be anecdata but am interested in hearing anyway.  Part of what brought up the discussion is not being able to find a killer use case for our own Zapier account so it makes us wonder if there is a bump in sales after integrating Zapier if it&#x27;s just customers aspirationally thinking they&#x27;ll use it or possibly if two companies otherwise are relatively equal that the one having Zapier is &quot;better&quot;.  Also any thoughts on the integration experience would be helpful as well.

There are in-game purchases, and also a subscription plan.  Sales are split about evenly between the two.<p>For the subscriptions, originally they offered 1 month, 3 month, 6 month, and Lifetime subscription plans.  When I came on board the first thing I did was eliminate the Lifetime subscription option (replacing  it with a 1 year plan).  I know from my SaaS background that lifetime plans are a killer.

It&#x27;s like a ponzi scheme where you rely on money from new customers to keep paying your support staff dealing with old customers.)<p>However I now have 2 problems:<p>1) Sales are down. At first I thought it was just a &quot;rain shadow&quot; from all those lifetime subscriptions that had already been sold.  (Also the old owner was doing a big sale on lifetime subscriptions before I started, and a ton of people bought it.)   But now it&#x27;s 6 months later and sales are still down.<p>2) People are always asking me why there isn&#x27;t a lifetime option. Now some of those people have been around the game for a long time so they would remember we had it before, but some people are new to the game and asking about it.  I see some other online games offer lifetime plans, so is that just a thing in the gaming business?<p>So my questions are... should I offer a lifetime subscription?

We encountered a problem in the form of an endless wall of paperwork when trying to buy real estate for investment purposes. Real estate industry is still pretty outdated, there are still real estate agents who charge 3% to represent the seller and another 3% to represent the buyer, there are technology platforms like Redfin that are trying to tackle that particular challenge by charging 1% and hiring a salaried employee to represent the buyer&#x2F;seller. However, buying a percentage ownership in a property still remains a difficult problem. We strive to build a platform to connect interested buyers&#x2F;investors with each other to raise enough capital to purchase a property together. This way if a property is a great investment, but you don&#x27;t have enough money to cover the full purchase price you can use our platform to buy a percentage of that property and allow others to invest in the remaining equity. You will then receive your share of the rental income + appreciation on your equity ownership over time.\nI want to thank everyone in advance for providing feedback and looking forward to hearing your thoughts and any concerns.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alphacap.ai","time":1566408808,"title":"Show HN: Buy Partial Real Estate with Credit Card","type":"story"},{"by":"rbanffy","descendants":491,"id":20759306,"kids":[20760077,20760874,20760248,20759833,20759636,20760047,20759904,20761023,20760433,20759970,20760301,20760160,20760079,20760491,20761097,20759854,20761129,20760554,20760049,20764538,20764026,20767102,20760938,20760627,20759964,20764811,20759942,20764526,20761293,20760748,20769835,20760250,20764758,20760832,20763005,20764027,20761562,20760570,20759875,20759851,20760548,20762042,20760106,20760736,20759478,20760154,20759819,20760886,20759562],"score":567,"time":1566408539,"title":"16M Americans will vote on hackable paperless machines","type":"story","url":"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614148/16-million-americans-will-vote-on-hackable-paperless-voting-machines/"},{"by":"bpierre","descendants":8,"id":20759304,"kids":[20759907,20760780,20759983],"score":35,"time":1566408532,"title":"My First Aragon App: Voting Supercharged with DAOstack’s Holographic Consensus","type":"story","url":"https://blog.aragon.one/first-aragon-app-holographic-consensus-part-1/"},{"by":"yasp","descendants":293,"id":20759301,"kids":[20760613,20761844,20759451,20759618,20759779,20762128,20759575,20761111,20761810,20760188,20759629,20760243,20759560,20760847,20761141,20759653,20759471,20760787],"score":218,"time":1566408506,"title":"Germany for First Time Sells 30-Year Bonds Offering Negative Yields","type":"story","url":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/germany-for-first-time-sells-30-year-bonds-offering-negative-yields-11566385847?mod=rsswn"},{"by":"open-source-ux","descendants":32,"id":20759277,"kids":[20759751,20760601,20759953,20759766,20760158],"score":35,"time":1566408326,"title":"The underground farm growing salad crops in a disused air raid shelter [video]","type":"story","url":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/science-environment-49411645/does-the-future-of-farming-exist-beneath-city-streets"},{"by":"jonbaer","descendants":70,"id":20759275,"kids":[20759497,20768021,20759414,20759621,20760030,20760059,20760516,20759549,20759346,20760558,20760630,20759361],"score":64,"time":1566408298,"title":"A.I.

I want to know how to better mitigate risk.<p>I use a KeePassX database as my password manager with a strong master password. It&#x27;s synced to my laptop via syncthing, so it&#x27;s not stored in the cloud. All my passwords are randomly generated, strong, and different. I use the official client on Solus Linux, and the Keepass2Android client on Android (Pixel 2).<p>My bank has not yet given me the official version of events. In fact, I do not trust them to provide the correct and actual version of events including details, as I have been given contradicting information from different sources at the company.<p>They believe the compromise occurred by a keylogger, or other method of stealing credentials, leading to a successful login. This was identified as suspicious, and my online account was suspended (good result). Although the resulting action taken by my bank is good, their communication of the issue is horrendous and I am going to lodge a complaint.<p>Now I do know that RSA is not infallible, however they would have needed my credentials + valid RSA token value to login successfully. This concerns me, and I will be asking my bank whether the token was used and is likely compromised.<p>I have changed all critical account passwords (bank, Google, socials, PayPal,etc) and also changed the password of my password database.<p>From my (limited) cyber sec knowledge I can think of the following ways the attackers could have gotten my creds.<p>1. Keylogger is present on one of my devices.<p>2. Hacked password store master password (unlikely unless keylogger).<p>3. Clipboard sniffing (I used to copy+paste from password manager to input fields,now I don&#x27;t).<p>4. Social engineering (bank).<p>5. Brute force<p>6.

Can you provide any tips?<p>EDIT: Bank has indicated that there were coordinated logon <i>attempts</i> but no actual logon. So RSA was not compromised, just user + pass.

We currently use the former but I want to run the later as well to see if we can eventually switch.<p>(ii) must work across web &amp; mobile (comes with SDKs for both Android and iOS)<p>(iii) accurate attribution, funnels, etc. I am especially confused when it comes to aliasing, i.e. matching an identity to a user before they log in. Apparently, only Kissmetrics can do that, which I find odd.<p>(iv) I’d like to implement Segment and also potentially Autopilot, so we can add functionality through third-parties that is not native. This means we don’t need a tool with kitchen sink features and would connect notifications, email, heatmaps, A&#x2F;B, etc.<p>(v) Other than that, we care about everything that would matter for any multi-platform e-commerce. Attribution is a big issue, of course, as are accurate funnels, drilldowns, etc.<p>I am looking at Heap, Amplitude, Mixpanel, Pendo, Kissmetrics. We’ve already ruled Firebase out. I also started to look at Oribi and Roivenue, but have not talked to them yet.<p>I’d be grateful for any first-hand experience with the above as demos&#x2F;talks with some of them have not been that useful.

I can&#x27;t afford that. It&#x27;s way above my budget.<p>Do you know any universities that has an affordable bachelors degree program ?<p>I live in Europe but it can be everywhere in the world.

We&#x27;re building a breathalyzer for cannabis.<p>I bet some of you have had the same idea cross your mind that we had: &quot;If we have a breathalyzer for alcohol, why don&#x27;t we have a breathalyzer for cannabis?&quot; We&#x27;re nanotechnology engineering alumni from the University of Waterloo. Two factors led into us deciding to pursue this idea: 1. Cannabis was being legalized across Canada and police were completely ill-prepared, so we saw an opportunity to help; 2. the science required to make this device exist was particularly interesting.<p>Alcohol breathalyzers are fundamentally a fuel cell where the alcohol in your breath sample is oxidized, which then produces an electrical current that the device then translates to BAC. For alcohol, this works because of Henry&#x27;s Law, which says that at any given temperature the ratio between the concentration of alcohol in the blood and that in the alveolar air in the lungs is constant.<p>Cannabis is a very different beast. Not only is it a non-volatile, fat-soluble molecule, but the mechanism in which THC (the psychoactive component of cannabis) appears in your breath isn&#x27;t super straight forward. Also, it is present in much lower concentrations in the breath compared to alcohol. Whereas a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08% (the legal limit in most states) might result in a concentration of 208 ppm of ethanol in the breath, a similarly impairing dose of cannabis results in 0.00001 ppm of the drug in breath.<p>Detecting such a low concentration is difficult, and as a result, cannabis drug use has been detected in a variety of sub-optimal ways. The state of the art is a blood draw, followed by detection of THC at a toxicology laboratory using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. While accurate and well-validated, this approach has several problems. First of all, since THC is fat-soluble it remains in a person&#x27;s body much longer than alcohol, especially if that person is a frequent user. Frequent users have been known to have detectable THC in their blood one week after beginning abstinence. These people are clearly not impaired all week but could be arrested and charged with a DUI based on many states laws across the US. Interestingly, police have the opposite problem with infrequent users. For most people, the concentration of THC in their system will decay quickly post-consumption. It takes around 2 hours (at best) for a police officer to get a blood draw from a suspect. At this point, many people will no longer have detectable THC in their system. Our device solves both these problems for police. Our breathalyzer uses an ultra-sensitive immunosensor to detect the minute concentration of THC in breath. Breath is the better medium for cannabis testing for several reasons. First of all, THC concentration in breath for both frequent users and infrequent users decays below detectable levels within 3-4 hours post-consumption and we have never detected THC in the baseline for any of our subjects. So our device does not incorrectly identify frequent users as impaired as blood testing can. Secondly, the breath tests can be administered quickly roadside, eliminating the risk of concentration decay seen with blood draws.<p>Our device comes with a reusable analyzer and a single-use disposable cartridge. It costs us $2 to make a cartridge, and police are willing to pay $20 per test. An individual will breathe into the mouthpiece, and our filter system will collect exhaled breath particles (specifically non-VOCs). Currently, we manually &quot;extract&quot; the THC off of the filter into a solvent liquid, but in the future, this will be automated using novel microfluidics. The solvent, with the captured THC, is then transferred to the surface of the sensor- which is an electrochemical immunoassay. When the THC is there, the output signal is different than when the THC is not there (happy to dive further into this in the comments if people are interested).<p>We haven&#x27;t had enough resources to run any formal trials yet to publish data, but that is changing this year. We&#x27;ve hired a contract research organization, (shout out Curebase), to help us run our very first clinical trial with blood draws. We&#x27;re going to be looking at the correlation between breath and blood concentrations, at various time intervals after consumption, to validate (or invalidate!) our preliminary in house data.<p>Selling to the police is notoriously difficult, but we&#x27;re imagining a world where there are one of our devices in every police car in North America. This weekend we exhibited at the IACP DAID and the response from the attendees was great! We have over 30 police departments across North America that have expressed interest in purchasing the device and that number is increasing every day.<p>We&#x27;re excited to hear all your questions and feedback!

Since I have a large data set, I experience quite slow computation times for my code, in both languages.<p>-R: I am using tableone() package which isn&#x27;t particularly fast, I suspect, and I use dplyr and data.table for munging. If I wrote my own function for making tables, do you think it would be any faster? I could also try to utilize data.table for a higher % of the coding process?<p>-STATA: Do I really need to do my regressions in STATA? I have heard they are much slower in R, especially given that our fixed effects model has around 150 hospital sites to adjust each model for. Ideally, couldn&#x27;t I do this within R so I don&#x27;t have to pipe the data from STATA back into R? Or is there an easy way to export STATA output into R to then munge into tables?<p>Thanks for your help. I am stressing on this project and I want to level up the automation.

Why? Because the way it&#x27;s done now is a pain. Stakeholders, especially engineers, are required to spend unnecessary time with software salespeople. We believe that the buying process should be dictated by the buyer.  For example, if you want to procure New Relic, you should be able to do it your way, not the salesperson’s way. Vendr was created so that companies can get the SaaS they need without needing to invest the time to procure.<p>My background is in software sales.  Previous to founding Vendr, I was head of enterprise sales for InVision and director of SMB sales for HubSpot, so I&#x27;ve learned how to buy and sell software.  I’ve witnessed that many salespeople are really good at wasting customers&#x27; time (unnecessary qualification calls, demos, etc).  Buying and renewing software is complicated, and even more if you want to get the best deal. We take care of all that and get you the software you need, fast, and at the best possible price.  We also handle renewals and are able to reduce the price per seat as a company grows.<p>Vendr is currently buying and renewing software for many fast-growing companies.  We are currently working with Canva, GitLab, Brex, Drift, HubSpot, InVision, and others.  These companies have hired us to save time and money.  And it’s working.  For example, in our first 12 months working with InVision, we saved them over $1.5M.  Many of our customers are good negotiators, but they’ve realized that spending the cycles is not a good use of their time.<p>Here’s how it works: We are typically hired by the head of finance or engineering.  We analyze and organize your current SaaS purchases and renewal dates. You introduce Vendr to your vendors and we manage the procurement process from start to finish—getting you exactly what you need without ever having to pick up the phone.  We are integrated into your Slack environment to keep you posted along the way.<p>We make money via a monthly subscription to buy and renew all of the SaaS in your stack.  Our subscription fee is based on your company size and ranges from $2k-10k+. Happy to chat directly at ryan@vendr.com.<p>Have you experienced specific issues buying software? How have your experiences been working with software salespeople?

HN!<p>I’m Kevin, founder of Dex (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getdex.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getdex.com&#x2F;</a>). Dex is a personal CRM that reminds you to keep in touch with people you might otherwise forget.<p>I started working on Dex because I felt like I was falling out-of-touch with people I cared about. I wanted to be aware of “how long it had been” and more proactive about maintaining my relationships.<p>Looking to solve this problem, I tried data tools like Airtable, Notion, and Google Sheets. It was easy to setup a sheet to track relationships, but I eventually found these tools difficult to keep up with. I’d end up procrastinating on updating my records and would rarely find the time to revisit them.<p>Dex is a personal CRM that aims to be simple, intuitive, and accessible.  To get started, users sign up for a web application that connects with their Google contacts and calendar (and optionally Facebook and LinkedIn data).  With this information, Dex suggests people to contact every day. Over time, these suggestions become better as users customize how frequently they’d like to reach out.<p>Dex includes the functionality you might include from a CRM: logging notes, setting reminders, and organizing contacts. A feature which makes Dex unique is a Chrome extension, which allows you to view relationship history and add people without leaving social networking sites like LinkedIn, Messenger, Twitter, and Facebook.<p>Most people realize the value and fulfillment that come from maintaining relationships, but occasionally still fall out of touch due to forgetfulness. Dex helps these people with a system of regular reminders to keep in touch.  I’ve noticed many people already have their own ‘system’ for managing relationships, and I’m always interested in hearing about different people think about dealing with staying on top of relationships.<p>I’d also welcome any other feedback about Dex!

We use\nmachine learning to help identify homes where values are likely to\nappreciate, and we help home buyers buy them. People can partner up with us to buy a recommended property. If they do, we are willing to cover any potential losses on the property. In exchange, the buyer agrees to share some of the future profit on the home with us. The agreement lasts 3 years.<p>Before starting this company, my co-founder and I had tried to invest in homes. However, we quickly got tired of realtors telling us to make offers based on very little data. We wanted to figure out a way to buy affordable homes that had the highest growth potential via a data driven approach. We realized there was a wealth of new alternative data out there, which could be used to predict both neighborhood growth and individual property growth. This alternative data we envisioned ranged from the growth in the number of postings on social media about a specific dog breed, to the number of restaurants in an area serving a specific type of trendy food, to the average wait time for ride sharing apps, and the average maximum temperature an area can experience.<p>Our tech involves running clustering to identify trends and keywords from text based data (e.g.: social media photo tags, business reviews) that are associated with different categories of neighborhoods (for example: rich&#x2F;suburban&#x2F;static, middle-class&#x2F;urban&#x2F;growing). We then take these insights and feed them into a larger model with historical home prices, house level features, and an array of other numeric features (e.g. ride sharing wait times, new businesses) that predicts future home price on both an individual property and neighborhood level. With this trained model we can then predict future home prices based on these alternative data sources (as well a few traditional data sources). As we ingest more data going forward we are constantly retraining and reoptimizing our models. Along with successful backtesting we have been tracking our predictions to validate our models in production and have found that properties we had identified 12 months ago have beaten the market in appreciation by an average of 14 points (yay!).<p>Most young working professionals want to live in or near large metropolitan cities for the lifestyle and better jobs market. This has contributed to extremely high home prices for places like the bay area and many young professionals end up paying rent that is on par with a mortgage payment. However, instead of building equity in their own future through an investment, they are simply making their landlords richer.<p>We want to change this by giving people another option. They can now invest in a home and their capital can be protected should the investment flop. The trade off is that these homes tend to be located in areas not “currently” deemed to be a desirable neighborhood. In essence, we want to help inexperienced home buyers make smarter decisions, and we are willing to risk our own capital for that.\nIn the event of a downturn in the market we are hedging our exposure by buying deep out of the money options that track the real estate market. These hedges are also attached to each individual contract so even if we were to go out of business before the maturation of the agreement or before a downturn in the market your downside protection would still be alive and well! As a result, anything that’s above a 20% decline across the portfolio will be covered by the hedging instruments, so we only need to be able to guarantee the range between 0 to -20% using our own capital. To make sure we can abide by the guarantee, we know exactly how many contracts we can enter into, and we will not go above that threshold until we obtain more funding.<p>Sign up with us to receive a list of recommended properties that our models think will appreciate over the next 3 years. Make an offer on the property you like the most using any method you’d like. If you don’t have an agent you work with, we can recommend you one along with helping you get a mortgage. After you make an offer on a home, you enter into a contract with us. We agree to cover losses over the next 3 years and in exchange, you share some of the future upside with us.<p>Let us know if you have any questions or insights, and I’ll be happy to respond!

We are the founders of Shift Health (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shifthealth.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shifthealth.io</a>). We help patients understand what they will owe pre-visit and provide flexibility to pay overtime.<p>Purchasing health care is unlike anything else you buy in our society today. You wouldn’t expect to walk into a grocery store, take home a loaf of bread not knowing the price and then receive a surprise bill 3 months later. So why is this the standard experience for buying health care services? The surprising thing is that the standard experience for doctors offices is not much better. Antiquated billing processes compounded with the fact that patients are responsible for more and more of the bill out of pocket is creating a scenario where doctors offices are only collecting 40% to 60% of the patient out-of-pocket responsibility. We partner with doctors offices to tell patients what their expected out-of-pocket price is before they see their doctor and provide flexibility to pay overtime. Our mission is to make healthcare costs understandable and affordable for all.<p>We all met working on a marketing venture together that we have since exited. While working on our marketing company we carved out time each Friday to discuss big problems that we had the right talents to solve. Those Super Duper Friday’s (as we called them) were really valuable for us. Lance R. (Rodela) has worked in healthcare tech for most of his career (Medicity, Aetna, SolutionReach), and he cued us into the trend of High Deductible Health Plans (HDHP’s). These plans are being rapidly adopted and are having adverse impacts for patients and healthcare organizations. Patients owe more and more out of pocket (up 12% just last year), and healthcare organizations are ill equipped to collect effectively from patients. We set out to validate the problem, and everyone else we talked to agreed that medical billing is almost never a positive experience. So we set off to fix it.<p>Even with Rodela’s background we didn’t realize how hard this was going to be in the beginning. Healthcare has been very resistant to disruption to date. Antiquated legacy systems abound, political lobbyists hover over everything and administrative staff have to be extra cautious not to find themselves on the wrong side of countless regulations and legislation. In short...it’s gnarly. Not sure if it was insanity or inspiration that drove us forward, but onward we went. First, we went out and talked to clinical leaders near us. It did not take us very long to find an excited pilot partner to innovate with us. We did a lot of discovery work with their billing, front office, and operations teams to understand their workflow and requirements. Next we spoke with dozens of patients to better understand their needs, pain points, and challenges. Once we had a firm grasp, we presented mockups and prototypes to the clinic and to their patients to refine an MVP. Finally, we set to work constructing our solution.<p>As we neared completion on the MVP the next hurdle (prior to even getting launched) appeared. We needed to integrate with the practice’s Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system. Fortunately, our partner had a strong relationship with their EMR provider, which saved us months of what would have otherwise been frustrating back and forth. Whew… we made it, right? Yup! Well, we made it to stage one at least. We launched the pilot and saw excellent feedback from both sides. Patients would text us saying “I love love love this” and our pilot partner saw patient collections grow by 30%.<p>We are not stopping there though. To build the best estimations we needed to build into insurance networks and more, and that is what we are pioneering today. There is still a lot of tech to build (calling all health tech pros hungry to work on something big!), but we are excited to announce that today we are able to text obstetrics patients 48 hours before their appointment how much their care will cost them out of pocket with 95% accuracy.<p>Healthcare payments have been a giant mess for a long time, but all of this is approaching a massive tipping point for change with 3 important market forces:<p>1. Financial Forces: Due to the rapid adoption of HDHP’s, patients are financially responsible for more of their bill. Doctors offices are ill-equipped for this paradigm shift and are collecting less (40%-60% of patient balances are written off). Patients want to know their costs ahead of time, and we have proven that doctors will collect more when they communicate ahead of time and provide flexible payment options.<p>2. Social Forces: Healthcare costs and spending has been catapulted to the center of the upcoming presidential debates, and an executive order requiring price transparency in the United States was signed in June 2019.<p>3.

I&#x27;ve been a developer for a bit over ten years, and while I genuinely enjoy development in many ways, I&#x27;ve stopped feeling like I have much to bring to it or get from it and I&#x27;ve decided I&#x27;d like to pursue a business idea instead. Programming and other past career experience will complement it well.<p>I&#x27;ve looked at some local resources for how to determine viability, potential market, figure out what my cash flow will look like, etc. and everything looks fine for the most part. This research wasn&#x27;t too hard to do, but I&#x27;m also curious about how people make this transition on a personal as well as professional level.<p>It feels as though leaving development is like throwing away &#x27;easy&#x27; money. At the moment I can be compensated reliably well for my skills. It&#x27;s hard to walk away from that. It&#x27;s also hard to walk away from knowing I can definitely have a positive cash flow.<p>Another hurdle is that this endeavour wouldn&#x27;t produce much income for around 2 years. I can speed that up a bit and soften that financial hit by taking out a loan, but I&#x27;m in a spot where borrowing isn&#x27;t necessarily <i>essential</i> and I&#x27;m very averse to taking on debt. But what are your perspectives on loans vs investment?<p>Without outside financial assistance, I think I&#x27;d need to continue programming until my business found traction. Are there feasible ways to do that though? I wouldn&#x27;t be able to be an involved member of a team, but I <i>would</i> be able to do good work remotely and independently.

Boost is developing spray treatments for fruits and crops to prevent mold, mildew and fungi.  Packagers can use our products to extend shelf-life for fruits, and farmers can increase yield of crops.  The active ingredients are live microbes.<p>I (Jamie) have been in biotech for over a dozen years.  A decade ago, I was at a biofuels company working to grow algae, and fungi ruined our crop.  At the time I realized that if we could control the ecosystem, we could prevent these kinds of agricultural disasters.  In the meantime, Adam, as a professor at Berkeley National Lab and UC-Berkeley over the last two decades, had been developing a technology platform to understand microbial ecology.  When Adam and I met a few years ago, we realized that his technology could address these kinds of challenges.  No longer interested in algae as a crop, we saw the opportunity in high-value crops.  These include strawberries in the field, apples post-harvest and cannabis as an exploding opportunity.<p>We&#x27;re clearly not the first ones to think about microbial products for ag.  What sets our approach apart is the technology that Adam developed.  Using his approach, we are able to determine what we call an interaction map - the complete set of interactions between microbes from a given environment.  The interaction map generates leads for us, including groups of microbes that work together as &#x27;consortia&#x27;.  Our current lead product candidates are in fact consortia.<p>Our first product is a soil amendment being sold into the cannabis market.  There&#x27;s a real excitement of the opportunities for the market to expand, and it&#x27;s an industry full of early-adopters.  We&#x27;re looking longer term, though, as our products will address food production and waste.  Fungi destroy enough food to feed 600M people every year—this represents 60% of the people going hungry every year!  This is the kind of impact we&#x27;re after with our tech and with the company.<p>We look forward to discussing the opportunity and technology!","time":1565715958,"title":"Launch HN: Boost Biomes (YC S19) – Microbes for better crop yields, shelf life","type":"story"},{"by":"adamcarson","descendants":513,"id":20687631,"kids":[20688712,20687788,20688921,20687920,20687849,20690977,20689019,20689222,20692410,20688895,20689719,20689388,20687837,20687980,20688964,20689057,20689268,20688392,20690282,20687910,20689789,20687887,20690015,20688715,20690424,20688377,20688220,20689437,20691426,20690750,20692852,20693770,20691311,20692438,20689512,20699272,20688010,20688201,20689075,20689262,20690480,20693455,20693141,20689096,20693366,20690170,20692719,20691101,20688369,20688936,20689639,20692391,20690914,20692062,20692373,20697834,20692090,20688299,20689952,20689777,20693478,20690353,20689216,20689442,20691738,20702759,20714260,20693161,20688150,20688733,20693120,20689689,20688185,20693687,20688366,20688142,20692843,20688870,20692329,20691439,20689357,20688690,20688793],"score":755,"time":1565715269,"title":"Fewer Than Half of Google Searches Now Result in a Click","type":"story","url":"https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/"},{"by":"makeee","descendants":131,"id":20688044,"kids":[20688061,20688262,20688800,20689401,20688470,20692233,20688454,20689466,20691100,20691886,20692189,20691465,20689954,20688466,20688251,20690891,20693212,20690166,20688654,20688807,20690290,20689072,20709792,20692575,20690233,20690614,20688417,20691292,20690186,20697584,20688568,20692035,20692212,20693420,20692027,20693482,20692179,20692319,20718211,20689660,20688644,20691779,20689478,20689001],"score":511,"time":1565717202,"title":"Show HN: Divjoy – React Codebase and UI Generator","type":"story","url":"https://divjoy.com"},{"by":"bookofjoe","descendants":67,"id":20687552,"kids":[20687892,20688120,20687865,20688552,20688527,20692574,20689273,20688261,20688880,20688269,20688127,20688609,20688024,20688059,20688606,20687817,20687906],"score":50,"time":1565714852,"title":"Do older people have a different smell?","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/well/live/do-older-people-have-a-different-smell.html"},{"by":"7961636B6572","descendants":171,"id":20687398,"kids":[20688376,20687653,20690249,20690009,20688274,20688233,20687600,20687757,20687575,20689056,20693695,20688947,20698082,20690659,20692172,20694262,20687580,20690690,20687760,20695675,20689721,20687654,20689751,20689492,20687982,20687643,20689445,20693252,20688521,20692974,20693204,20692389,20689615,20690779,20687558,20689754,20689988,20689678,20689684,20688772,20693231,20689219,20691221,20690711,20688945,20689562,20689173,20689369,20688319,20699849,20693005,20702088,20689017,20689043,20687512,20687500,20690545,20690225,20693394,20687646,20724425],"score":246,"time":1565713935,"title":"Show HN: Yack – Community Browser for Hacker News, Reddit, YouTube and More","type":"story","url":"https://yack.io"},{"by":"AndrewBissell","descendants":25,"id":20687284,"kids":[20688588,20688467,20688526,20688505,20688618,20688513],"score":27,"time":1565713406,"title":"Authorities Investigating 4chan Post on Epstein's Death","type":"story","url":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/janelytvynenko/fdny-investigating-jeffrey-epstein-4chan-post"},{"by":"JumpCrisscross","descendants":134,"id":20687266,"kids":[20687560,20687953,20687576,20687579,20687506,20688041,20688052,20687861,20687563,20687524,20687957],"score":73,"time":1565713310,"title":"Xi’s Dilemma: Send Forces into Hong Kong, or Wait Out Protesters","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-13/xi-s-dilemma-send-forces-into-hong-kong-or-wait-out-protesters"},{"by":"zunzun","descendants":3,"id":20687080,"kids":[20687189,20687351],"score":6,"text":"The recent civilian video showing the very large shock wave from the recent Russian offshore military explosion, as evidenced by condensation behind the shock wave front, indicates either a low-power nuclear detonation or massive chemical explosion.

We work on detecting what really matters as it happens in your website or app.<p>As software engineers in various companies, we repeatedly got overwhelmed by the amount of product analytics we had to keep track of. What specific metrics are you supposed to monitor when you have dozens or hundreds of them, each metric having contextual information about the user, device type, location, language, etc.? This can represent thousands to millions of useful sub-metrics. Despite spending significant time monitoring analytics dashboards on Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Amplitude, Grafana and more, we had to keep track of so many metrics and user segments that impactful events regularly went unnoticed. We often missed technical incidents, but also business opportunities such as not knowing that a feature really moved the needle or that there was sudden adoption for a specific user group.<p>We started Lazy Lantern to build an automated way of analyzing any number of metrics in real-time. The goal is to provide a good picture of impactful events as they happen, both in the case of negative anomalies (outages, bugs, crashes) and positive anomalies (virality, marketing, growth). In practice, we automatically detect abnormal patterns for each metric, in particular temporary spikes&#x2F;drops, level changes, trend changes and seasonality changes. In case of anomaly, we surface the user segments that are most affected and we group correlated anomalies together to give you a better picture of what parts of the product are impacted.<p>On the implementation side, there were a couple of requirements for an effective anomaly detection algorithm. It has to be:<p>- Autonomous: avoiding manual configuration to be able to scale to arbitrarily high numbers of metrics<p>- Unsupervised: being able to detect anomalies for all types of businesses without knowing beforehand what a typical anomaly for each business looks like<p>- Dynamic: accommodating all kinds of seasonalities and trends, which excludes using static thresholds<p>- Fast: deciding whether a data point is indicative of an incident in minimal time<p>To fulfill these requirements, we first tried the Holt-Winters seasonal models, but finally got the best results with a procedure based upon Facebook’s Prophet forecasting model. To provide a better sense of each anomaly’s severity as well as what areas of the product are affected, we integrated two additional functionalities:<p>- Anomaly severity scoring based on the number of impacted users, deviation from prediction and anomaly duration<p>- Anomaly grouping using a reproduction of VARCLUS, which groups metrics by clusters based on their partial correlations<p>For this initial launch, we are targeting Segment customers, which makes enabling our product a breeze. If people find it useful, we will provide wider support. Pricing is based on the number of metrics you want to track. If you email us at contact@lazylantern.com mentioning this post, we’ll extend the free trial to 3 months.

Think of it as what you wish Crashlytics had evolved into combined with the session replay capability of Fullstory.<p>Before Embrace, I co-founded the mobile gaming company Scopely, where we made six top-grossing mobile games including Yahtzee, Walking Dead, and Star Trek. The pain I felt while developing those games sparked the idea for Embrace. Customers and I would find bugs that were impossible to reproduce by the development and QA teams, and the analytics and logging tools we had in place just weren’t enough to solve them.<p>We had crashes under control, so we cared more about startup freezes, failed purchases, and out-of-memory app closes. Without reproducing the issue, we couldn’t tell if the error was caused by a fundamental code issue, something with my device settings, a network problem, or just a very unfortunate combination of all of the above. The solution seemed simple: I wanted to look up my session and see all the user interactions, networking and logging together to find out what caused my issue.<p>After talking with my friends at other mobile app companies, I knew I wasn’t alone. Things worked well in development, but we saw unexpected errors in production and we never had enough information to solve them. I wanted more than just a stack trace to help developers fix the problem, so my co-founder Fredric—who has now built three mobile analytics companies—and I started Embrace.<p>We&#x27;ve talked with many mobile developers and companies and we saw many common problems with apps, such as slow app starts resulting from too many blocking network calls on startup, and we have built the features into our platform to help solve these problems. We also saw processes that were more cumbersome than they needed to be. Often when developers had to fix an issue they would try to combine data from backend logs, different monitoring tools, and feedback from bug reporters to try to build a picture of what was going wrong, but in the end it still wasn’t enough. There was always that one log message that they realized they should have added and they had to wait another release cycle figuring out a fix for the issue.<p>You can add Embrace’s SDK to your app to start collecting the info I had been missing when building apps. We intercept network calls, track views, monitor CPU usage, capture crashes, and automatically collect many more metrics to provide developers with the context that they have told us helps them solve problems. Add logs and breadcrumbs that you define, and we are able to get you as close to replaying user sessions as possible without capturing video. You’ll be to see able to see the network calls before a failed purchase or whether or not the device was in low-power mode when it crashed.<p>We are fortunate to have 40+ customers already, including Wish, OkCupid, AllTrails, and Home Depot. We helped solve the 2nd largest, long-standing crash for Wish by providing their developers with context they were lacking. Developers for a subscription revenue app were able to identify that a critical network call did not occur as expected when users took a certain path through their app. The most recent customer I visited solved two bugs using info from our tool the day after they integrated.<p>We look forward to answering any questions you have and hearing what challenges you face with your mobile apps. We are free to use in development, so any feedback you have on the service would be much appreciated!","time":1565629430,"title":"Launch HN: Embrace (YC S19) – Spot and fix bugs in mobile apps","type":"story"},{"by":"nafizh","descendants":3,"id":20677411,"kids":[20678589,20683246],"score":64,"time":1565629494,"title":"Visualizing Transformer Language Models: Illustrated GPT-2","type":"story","url":"https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-gpt2/"},{"by":"lpellegr","descendants":13,"id":20677365,"kids":[20682285,20677378,20678140,20677794,20683662,20677966],"score":6,"time":1565629268,"title":"Show HN: Ipregistry – A Fast, Reliable IP Geolocation and Threat API","type":"story","url":"https://ipregistry.co"},{"by":"prostoalex","descendants":240,"id":20676959,"kids":[20682013,20682114,20681706,20683211,20681852,20681902,20681785,20681736,20685602,20682192,20681730,20681872,20683315,20683085,20685512,20683861,20682074,20683918,20685306,20683775,20683114,20684487,20684030,20684483,20687061,20683519,20683341,20681965,20685180,20682448,20684581,20708813,20682640,20683745,20682120,20681876,20684516,20683405,20682083,20683612,20688966,20683015],"score":237,"time":1565627343,"title":"The hypersane are among us, if only we are prepared to look","type":"story","url":"https://aeon.co/ideas/the-hypersane-are-among-us-if-only-we-are-prepared-to-look"},{"by":"dyates","descendants":149,"id":20676949,"kids":[20678039,20677469,20677815,20678813,20680367,20677624,20677911,20683134,20680357,20677729,20677675,20680129],"score":162,"time":1565627308,"title":"Extended Validation Certificates Are Really Dead","type":"story","url":"https://www.troyhunt.com/extended-validation-certificates-are-really-really-dead/"},{"by":"dublin","descendants":467,"id":20676904,"kids":[20677170,20677715,20677023,20677294,20677387,20677790,20677148,20677052,20677093,20678516,20677043,20677198,20677852,20677860,20677016,20680256,20677588,20678940,20677685,20677313,20678497,20677235,20678228,20680023,20677095,20679844,20677154,20677220,20679535,20677021,20677576,20677056,20678300,20715157,20677080,20677410,20677008,20678674,20681385,20682789,20678427,20681447,20682043,20678600,20681473,20677310,20681356,20694365,20694638,20677837,20677875,20677260,20677166,20677735,20680339,20677078,20678239,20681590,20677206,20681993,20677660,20677371,20678250,20681100,20677802,20679846,20677152,20679095,20677789,20677756,20680133,20677074,20677009,20678438,20681502,20677038,20688550,20678277,20677842,20677135,20677096,20677090,20677105,20677217,20677070],"score":999,"time":1565627007,"title":"NULL license plate not such a bright idea","type":"story","url":"https://knrs.iheart.com/content/2019-08-12-clever-vanity-license-plate-backfires-on-man-winds-up-with-tons-of-tickets/"},{"by":"cyrusshepard","descendants":353,"id":20676755,"kids":[20677836,20680014,20677405,20677103,20677645,20678024,20677277,20679910,20677520,20678053,20676972,20678969,20677907,20677821,20677813,20678122,20677971,20680071,20677504,20678755,20683221,20682040,20683436,20682065,20678501,20680105,20678733,20681057,20681720,20678230,20678102,20678078,20678264,20680328,20682141,20680763,20678290,20677440,20680542,20681972,20680232,20680912,20679445,20680705],"score":750,"time":1565626248,"title":"Why has examine.com disappeared from search results?","type":"story","url":"https://examine.com/nutrition/google-update-july-2019/"},{"by":"justaguyhere","descendants":4,"id":20676649,"kids":[20676807,20683971],"score":3,"text":"Preferably lesser known ones, the weirder the better (mechanical puzzles, word puzzles, algorithm puzzles etc)<p>Any resource -

-&gt; Want to build a relatively simple responsive website like say Hacker News with Authn support (custom and Google OAuth). What is a minimal set of JS&#x2F;CSS frameworks, templating engine, deployment tools, IDE I need?<p>Details:<p>I am a professional Software Engineer (Google) and well versed in &quot;Backend&quot; Infra stuff and creating APIs. But when it comes to building anything with GUI, I am completely lost in the maze of modern day web dev! Last time I built a website was a bunch of mostly static pages (all hand generated - no templates either) with some JS plugins for a top bar nav. Life was simple with a simple SFTP to the webserver (Geocities or similar!) for hosting.<p>Of course over time, web development has become much more complex (primarily because Websites do much more now a days than they used to), and I see a plethora of frameworks, transpiled languages, etc such as: Gulp, Typescript, JSX, Dart, Angular, React, Bootstrap, Babel, Wordpress, Drupal, Flutter, NPM, Web assembly, Vue.js, Minification of code before deploying, jQuery, and a gazillions others. It&#x27;s hard to build a mental model when things are happening at 4 level of abstractions away, e.g., Typescript translated to some JS framework code which then uses jQuery underneath and which finally calls something I can actually relate to: document.getElementById()! Also missing from my skillset is debugging Websites using tools such as Chrome dev console.<p>Has someone in similar situation tried to learn modern day web-dev toolchain? Any suggestions, tutorials, etc are well appreciated! For backend server side, I am comfortable with Python (so prefer Flask or Django), but Node.js is also fine (used it a bit couple of years ago). Suggestions for an IDE&#x2F;plugins are also welcome (I have been using Vim for most of my life).","time":1565371316,"title":"Ask HN: Modern day web development for someone who last did it 15 years ago","type":"story"},{"by":"rmason","descendants":24,"id":20656369,"kids":[20657328,20661214,20657443,20657038,20659891,20657395,20660711,20658300,20657582,20657491,20661254,20661167,20660197,20656765,20657217],"score":34,"time":1565371051,"title":"Don’t Cheat on Interviews.

We make an app that manages employee-employee mentoring programs, and that ultimately improves employee career development and company culture.<p>Matt and I met while we were working at the Boston Consulting Group, an unusual workplace that gets a number of things really right. They rank Top 5 on Glassdoor every year for best places to work. The best thing there is the culture of &#x27;non-evaluative&#x27; mentoring. It was common to grab a coffee on a weekly basis with a senior colleague outside your team, talk through what strengths you want to develop, and that conversation would somehow eventually translate into a project together where you worked specifically on those areas. It&#x27;s the reason why we felt our &#x27;personal growth rate&#x27; really took off - someone was always aware of your goals.<p>That got us thinking about whether the experience could be replicable at other companies too, and that&#x27;s why we started Together.<p>We learned that a lot of companies have tried to run mentoring programs but the experience for employees wasn&#x27;t great. Examples: Someone picked your match for you, and it wasn&#x27;t a good fit; your match left the company and no one on the HR team even knew; you had a few sessions but had no clue what to talk about &#x2F; no sense of progress against any goals; as an HR person, you had no visibility into whether the program was working or not<p>Through Together, any employee can voluntarily sign up to be part of their company&#x27;s mentoring program. You can sign up to be a mentor, mentee or both - we&#x27;ve even had VPs enjoy the experience as a mentee. Once you fill out your mentoring profile, the magic is in the learning experience that is personalized just for you:<p>As a mentee, you get a curated list of the top 5 people at your company who signed up and can help you reach your goals. You can be part of one or multiple programs at the same time that focus on different career checkpoints, such as &quot;new manager&quot; or &quot;internship&quot; tracks. With that comes special agendas and content to work through with your mentor&#x2F;mentee\nYou can track progress to your goals and look back through your personal session history with mentees&#x2F;mentors - and if things aren&#x27;t going as planned, an admin might even proactively reach out to you and see if they can tweak who you&#x27;re working with<p>Many companies run mentoring programs today, but they largely fall flat. That&#x27;s why companies like Disney Studios ask us to help them relaunch in a new and more impactful way.<p>What has been your mentoring experience at work? I&#x27;d love to hear about what worked and what didn&#x27;t! What would you have liked to have? We&#x27;d love ideas for how an app like ours could support the mentoring experience for everyone involved.

Long story short: my girlfriend went on a 10 days planned holiday trip to Israel. Before boarding, she&#x27;s been sent to a separate security check, then interview room and got heavily questioned, - strip searched (!!!) and everything - for several hours. She eventually made it (flight had been delayed for some reasons).<p>Now, why am I asking here: when she has been taken to the interview room, all her electronics has been taken away. We have no idea what they did to them. She got back some of them when landed in Israel (Phone, camera, both being obviously searched through). However, they decided to keep the laptop. At the moment of writing, we don&#x27;t know where is the laptop neither if&#x2F;when&#x2F;how we&#x27;re going to get it. We also don&#x27;t know why they kept her for so long, why they questioned her, why they took her electronics, why they didn&#x27;t give it back to her before boarding and why she couldn&#x27;t get them back for the flight.<p>Now the real question: I&#x27;m concerned about the electronics themselves. Following the theory they could have been tapped, would it be possible to reset both phone and laptop (if we ever managed to get our hand back one), google pixel phone and macbook air 2012, in a way we know they wouldn&#x27;t be compromised? Could we do some sort of bootloader reset, or anything else that would guarantee a genuine hardware&#x2F;software?<p>In addition to obvious privacy concerns, my girlfriend has some clients who required privileged confidentiality and can&#x27;t afford working on potentially compromised hardware.<p>Any advice will be highly appreciated.

I&#x27;m not sure whether I should release this as a separate &quot;NG&quot; package, or do a bunch of work to make it 2.x compatible again, or if I can use something like 3to2.<p>- There&#x27;s a lot of changes on that &quot;next generation&quot; branch that I need to document.<p>- I haven&#x27;t read any of my project email or mailing list traffic in years.<p>- The project is hosted in mercurial on Bitbucket, I want to migrate it to git on Github. I have an old attempt to transfer it on Github already, I need to figure out how to update that to the latest mercurial revision.<p>- I should release a new version of the &quot;old&quot; (released) codebase with bugfixes, but I&#x27;m not as familiar with it anymore, compared to the &quot;next gen&quot; code.<p>Has anyone else gone through this? Any advice on where to start? Should I try to find a partner to help motivate me?

We make Quirk, an open-source Cognitive Behavioral Therapy app. (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;flaque&#x2F;quirk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;flaque&#x2F;quirk</a>)<p>If you&#x27;ve never seen a cognitive-behavioral therapist before, it&#x27;s easiest to understand by analogy with physical therapy. Like a physical therapist, a cognitive-therapist gives you goals and exercises to do, only they&#x27;re mental rather than physical. Similarly, Quirk gives you exercises where you record and challenge negative thoughts.<p>I work on Quirk with my brother, Koby, a former founder and marketer in both consumer products and the mortgage industry. He&#x27;s really good at simplifying, branding, and explaining complicated topics to the average consumer. Personally, I&#x27;m just an engineer who used to work on Segment&#x27;s developer platform.<p>Quirk started as a command line tool (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;flaque&#x2F;freak\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;flaque&#x2F;freak</a>) that I used to track my panic attacks. I&#x27;ve had severe attacks for as long as I can remember, some lasting several hours. I always used to down-play them, saying &quot;they&#x27;re a once-in-a-blue-moon thing.&quot; But that wasn&#x27;t really true and they started happening more and more. At a certain point they got so bad that I felt hopeless; I always assumed at some point in my life they&#x27;d just stop. But they didn&#x27;t. So I picked up a book on depression, which turned out to be the CBT bible, &quot;Feeling Good&quot; by David Burns. I started working through the exercises and saw a dramatic drop in panic attacks. (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;P29BSRC.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;P29BSRC.jpg</a>)<p>I started turning the CLI into a little app so I could use it wherever. But since I was having so few panic attacks and was constantly recording thoughts all the time, the project became a CBT app. And the more thoughts I recorded, the better I felt; I went from having multiple attacks a week to having two in a six month period.<p>I gave Quirk to folks with a &quot;this-software-will-probably-break-if-you-look-at-it-funny&quot; guarantee and open sourced it. But after a bit, it became pretty hard to ignore how many folks were relying on it. That was surprising; it&#x27;s small and it doesn&#x27;t really do much from a technical perspective. Its main claim-to-fame is that it works pretty well. Everyday we wake up to folks writing in saying that &quot;for the first time in 30 years I feel peaceful,&quot; or that they&#x27;re &quot;happier, healthier and feel so much better about everything,&quot; or that they feel like Quirk is &quot;their secret weapon.” We’re recommended by quite a few therapists but we’re also used by folks who aren’t currently seeing one and had never planned to before trying Quirk.<p>That&#x27;s fantastic, but that&#x27;s not really surprising: CBT has 40 years of evidence saying that it works really well, even in &quot;bibliotherapy&quot; where someone isn&#x27;t necessarily seeing a therapist. Quirk doesn&#x27;t do every part of CBT, but it does the most general, applicable-to-everyone part. So what Quirk is really doing is fixing CBT&#x27;s branding and consistency problems. Most people don&#x27;t know what CBT is, or if they do, they don&#x27;t realize just how effective it is and how much evidence is behind it. And when they &quot;try&quot; it, they often don&#x27;t really do it consistently enough to see the value. Quirk&#x27;s current feature set is just the thought-recording exercise with some cute illustrations, evidence building to prove to you that it works, and some silly skinner-box tricks to remind you to use it.<p>A lot of companies solve these massive technical or structural problems. We make a little toy app that helps you feel better. \nBut given just how approachable we could make CBT, we think we can help around 100 million people world-wide in the future. We&#x27;re translated into 14 languages (kinda, it&#x27;s a bit broken right now) and have quite an amazing and supportive community.<p>We charge a small subscription for Quirk, currently $4, though the price might change as we figure stuff out. Unlike a lot of other apps, we&#x27;re quite privacy conscious; we store your thoughts only on the device and don&#x27;t have any email or phone collection.<p>We want your feedback, questions, and ideas. If you&#x27;re comfortable sharing, we really want to hear about your experiences. But mainly, we want you to know that CBT exists and that this is really something that could help you if you haven&#x27;t been doing so hot lately.","time":1565287337,"title":"Launch HN: Quirk (YC S19) – Open-Source Cognitive Behavioral Therapy","type":"story"},{"by":"hsnewman","descendants":57,"id":20646841,"kids":[20649064,20648489,20648115,20647842,20647926,20648231,20657918,20649962,20651173,20651659,20647981],"score":204,"time":1565286998,"title":"Who Owns Your Wireless Service?

It was with someone who had just finished a 12 week  bootcamp and had received offers in the range of 100k-150k without much prior experience. I have &gt;20 years experience and at the moment I work at a medical device company making a little more than 150k without much prospect for advancement.<p>I have applied at a few jobs lately but I don&#x27;t have much to show for the currently fashionable technologies and it seems saying &quot;I can catch up in a few weeks&#x2F;months&quot; doesn&#x27;t cut it anymore these days. Being 50 years old doesn&#x27;t help much either probably.<p>I am wondering now if I did a bootcamp myself if that would get me up to speed with current stuff and open up new job opportunities. If people without experience are employable after 12 weeks I think I should do even better because I will understand the material quicker and should be able to go deeper.<p>i work a lot with younger people and I don&#x27;t think the stereotype of young people being innovative and old people being conservative applies to me. Usually I am the one pushing my team to try new stuff and doing creative things.  Unfortunately in medical progress is very slow so you pretty much always are 5-10 years behind state of the art.<p>So  the question is: Would doing a bootcamp increase employability and possible open up higher salary ranges? Are there any that cater to experienced people?  And what area to go into? I would love doing something around AI or large scale systems.

HN! We’re Greg and Vikrum, co-founders of Gold Fig.<p>Gold Fig is a tool that automatically creates a shared log of configuration changes to the SaaS tools you use. Modern applications are built atop a menagerie of these tools. Services like Stripe, SendGrid, Zapier, Segment, Twilio, Sentry, Travis, GSuite, domain registrars, CDNs, or even internal dashboards can directly affect your production and corporate environments, yet their configuration is not tracked with anything near the same fidelity as source code.<p>Mistakes occur when people make config changes without proper context. Depending on which service was impacted this can result in outage, loss of revenue, or reputational harm. It’s usually the thing that broke in a subtle way for some extended period of time that bites the worst. Moreover, when an incident does occur, the respondent often also has limited context about changes made, leading to longer resolution times and possibly even further misconfiguration as previous configuration was lost. As an example, we&#x27;ve personally experienced this pain when managing the CDNs fronting core services. We had to synchronize changes across our Fastly configurations, DNS records, and origin servers, with no single source of truth to guide us. Any mistake could result in downtime.<p>Some teams attempt to address this lack of context by putting one person in charge of doing all of the configuration for a service provider, leading to development bottlenecks. Other teams attempt to manually track these updates in a text file, email threads, or in their team chat. With Gold Fig, we want teams to be able to confidently share the management of their SaaS tools. Team members should have access to the full context behind all of the configurations they manage, and should be able to easily keep themselves up to date as they evolve. Gold Fig lives alongside automation tools like Terraform and Cloudformation, allowing you to plug the gaps that those tools can’t cover.<p>Our initial product is a browser extension that automatically launches on settings pages of SaaS tools. When you make a change on these sites, the extension gives you the opportunity to also provide a commit message, similar to how you would with a code check-in. Now you have a record of some button clicks that impacted your environment. The change has a permanent URL so you can look it up later if you forgot what you did, use it to help you move settings from staging to prod, or have others review the changes that were made. Now that Gold Fig has captured what changed, when, and why, you’ll never get stuck in a situation where only one person knows exactly how something was configured.  A byproduct of Gold Fig is that you now have a foothold into being able to undo these types of changes. We envision Gold Fig being part of all devops team’s way of surfacing and tracking changes. In the future we’ll be able to empower teams to do pull-request like approvals, show context before a change is about to occur, and provide more awareness to those responding production incidents.<p>Our extension is able to capture payloads while being generally agnostic of the site itself. We’ll capture changes even if we haven’t seen the site before or if something has changed from the previous time we encountered it. For common sites like AWS or GCP we capture additional rich context like the product being impacted, the region&#x2F;zone, and project name.

The shell prototype has been developed by CTO over 2 years (Concept Dev and UI). I worked extensively over the last 5 months and contributed significantly to major milestones, through which we gained significant traction with client&#x2F; VC interest. The company is still at pre-seed funding, with some money coming in from the CTO&#x27;s family.<p>I am now formally migrating to this firm and negotiating equity. My skillset is kind of a rare find - I have a Masters in Architecture, I can code very well and am good at Math, three skills crucial to develop the core tech, for which there is a lot to do.

At the time, I settled for it because it is a project I was really excited about and it was a great portfolio building opportunity for me as a developer, and I was quite empathetic to the financial situation. My contribution to the company can be said to be the backbone of it, but the founder denied me the title of co-founder on the basis that I was drawing salary while he is funding the company out of his pocket. We&#x27;re at seed funding right now and he&#x27;s only giving me 1%. But without me, the product wouldn&#x27;t be half of where it is today.<p>The general sense I get is that because I am young, my opportunity cost is lower and he&#x27;s using that as an excuse to give me less equity. My value to the company is plain to see because I&#x27;ve built something that everyone (other developers, investors, potential customers) is amazed by, but I have no numbers to quantify my value to the company because we are not making money yet (due to other factors that I have no control over). I have a colleague in my boss&#x27;s other company who is in a similar situation: young, low market rate, huge contribution to the company, only given 1%, no cofounder title. It&#x27;s pretty clear to me that he&#x27;s lowballing me and I&#x27;m pretty set on leaving, but I do want to know how much someone in my situation (young but huge contribution) should get, because I haven&#x27;t read about it anywhere.

We’re Eric, Peter, and Abhi, founders of Lang (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.langapi.co\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.langapi.co</a>). We help developers quickly translate their apps into foreign languages by combining internationalization SDKs with a command-line interface that integrates directly with human translators.<p>Previously, we all worked on building internationalization and localization tooling for companies. In our experience, companies don’t think about translation until too late, and the tech debt builds up very fast. It’s a nightmare to receive a task that says “translate app into Spanish.” Choosing the right open-source framework, refactoring the entire codebase, and integrating with human translators is a massive effort. As engineers, we wanted to work on features - not putting every string in our codebase into a translations.json file. In our months of internationalization work, we couldn’t find a good all-in-one toolkit. So we built Lang.<p>Like other internationalization libraries, Lang gives you a tr() function. Wrap your strings with tr(), and we’ll show your users translations that correspond to their language settings at run-time. But how do you actually get the translations? Open-source frameworks like Polyglot.js stop here, but Lang doesn’t. Run “push,” and our command-line tool will parse your code files, find tr() calls, collect newly added strings, and send them to human translators for you. For JavaScript, we use Babel to construct an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of your code, and traverse the tree to find tr()’d strings. For a developer, this makes it simple to add&#x2F;remove&#x2F;update strings: just run “push” in your terminal. You can track the status of your translations on our dashboard, and when they’re done just run “pull.” We’ll generate a translation file for you, and connect it with our tr() function. You own the file - Lang doesn’t make any network requests for translations at run-time, and your translations always load, even if our service is down.<p>This works for static strings in the code, but what about dynamic content in the backend or database? We expose a function called liveTr(), which takes a string argument. The first time liveTr() sees an untranslated string, it will make a request to Lang to translate it and return the string in its original language. But the next time, it will fetch the translation on-demand. We’ve shipped liveTr() with built-in caching functionality to reduce the number of network requests. We also have self-hosted solutions for users with high uptime requirements. This is a common in-house feature companies build for internationalization, and we want to make it available to all devs.<p>Lang currently supports JavaScript and Typescript apps (React, React Native, Vue etc.) with closed betas for Django, Android, and iOS. Give us a try at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.langapi.co&#x2F;signup\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.langapi.co&#x2F;signup</a> - machine translations are free, so you can see your app in another language in minutes.

Instantly setting off alarms&#x2F;notifying the police when one is exposed. Recent examples, somebody walking down the street of a popular nightlife area with many bars, holding a gun. Or walking up to the entrance of a popular shopping center. Even if the authorities had 5 - 10 seconds more to respond, it have a major impact on the outcome. I think I&#x27;ve also seen some startups working in the space. Of course it won&#x27;t be easy. But deployed in the proper areas, such as crowded nightlife areas, could make a huge difference.<p>- Better tracking of guns location and how guns are traded. This of course is already a law in many places, but I think there are many ways tech can be used to do it better. Including how we can source as much information as possible, within the limits of personal privacy, and put those points together.

We help employees understand their equity compensation.<p>We started Compound after seeing way too many of our friends get screwed over by startup equity.<p>You hear the story often: wide-eyed engineer accepts an offer and 100,000 options from an exciting startup. Woohoo! Suddenly you must make what may turn out to be the most important financial decision of your life, whether you know it yet or not: should you exercise your options?<p>The answer to this question depends upon many nuanced factors. Does the company allow for early exercising? If not, how long should you wait to exercise your options? When will you owe taxes? What is the Alternative Minimum Tax? How long is the exercise window if you cease employment? Will you ever qualify for the QSBS tax exemption? Will this be a qualifying disposition? Does your...wait...could you have negotiated for more equity? Do you really believe in the company? Should you even be working at an early-stage startup that you do not believe in?<p>Equity is really confusing. There is no one-size-fits-all solution. However, your equity is a crucial part of your compensation and is worth being scrutinized as such. Many people miss out on significant upside because they fail to familiarize themselves with key terms before it is too late.<p>There are 300-page books written on options but _nothing_ is personalized. Large financial institutions won’t talk to you unless you have millions of dollars in liquid assets. To make things worse, most companies do a terrible job of helping their candidates and employees understand the value of their equity. What does 100,000 options even mean? HR teams are frequently asked about equity-and tax-related matters from their employees and are forbidden from sharing useful, true things.<p>Jacob and I got really interested in these problems during our final year of university. We read books, consumed the entire tax code, and talked with dozens of experts. We became the de facto equity resource in our circles and helped hundreds of people with everything from negotiating offers to exercising options. This led to the start of Compound.<p>Over the years, there have been many proposals to fix equity compensation. There is no obvious simple answer. What is clear is that today’s system will eventually break. We are hoping Compound plays a role in the solution.<p>Compound is entirely focused on helping you—the employee—understand and manage your equity. We provide forecasting tools that show you how much your equity is worth, display tax implications (AMT exposure, capital gains), and model exit scenarios. We help you understand the value of your equity to make more informed exercise decisions. For the HN community, we are offering free informational consultations at (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;withcompound.com&#x2F;?ref=hn\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;withcompound.com&#x2F;?ref=hn</a>)<p>We also encourage companies to adopt more employee-friendly equity procedures and policies. We build tools, like fair offer-letter templates and internal equity dashboards, to promote transparency within companies. If your team is interested, please send me an email to jordan@withcompound.com.<p>In the future, Compound will earn revenue by offering financial products. We are still hammering out these details—our mission is to help employees maximize their upsides by democratizing access to financial services currently reserved for the super-rich (tax planning, advisory, bespoke investment offerings, concierge services, etc.).<p>We will be releasing more guides around this topic in the near future and would really appreciate your feedback and requests. Eager to hear about HN users’ experiences, ideas, and know there is a ton of expertise among the community to learn from.

hn, I need a reality check.

What are the chances we will succeed if the founders are assholes?<p>The team I work with writing code is great. We&#x27;re strong programmers. People have good ideas and understand the tech. We&#x27;re able to iterate and ship quickly. But interacting with the founders (one technical, one not) is a constant blame game of poor communication. They will get angry with people for not doing something that wasn&#x27;t communicated. Any difference in understanding is blamed on the person writing code. This happens almost daily.<p>My job feels like getting paid to put up with abuse. People literally get yelled at. Get called out in front of the team for &quot;not delivering&quot;, when most of the time the work was done. People get fired for dumb reasons. We&#x27;ve had 20+ people get fired or quit in frustration in the past two years (the whole team turning over several times). Is that normal?<p>I would never refer anyone. I&#x27;m stressed all of the time. I don&#x27;t see my family. I put in so much overtime. I get sometimes you need to work hard, but it feels no amount of work would fix the root problem: our founders treat people like crap. They have fired people and made it very clear they intend to buy their way through any problems by just hiring new people.<p>I do have some stock and I&#x27;m trying to decide if I should keep putting up with the abuse for the chance of a payoff. Our customers like us and have lots of money. It seems like we have a good product that might be an underdiscovered niche.

We help psychological and behavioral researchers quickly find participants they can trust.<p>We built Prolific because Katia had a hard time finding participants for her psychology studies during her PhD. She briefly used Amazon&#x27;s Mechanical Turk (MTurk), but didn’t like the user experience and couldn’t get the data she wanted (UK participants). The fundamental problem we’re hoping to help with is better access to psychological and behavioral data. This is challenging in many ways: You have to balance the growth of a multi-sided platform, achieve high data quality, align incentives for all stakeholders (researchers, participants, ourselves, society), diversify the participant pool, to name some. We’re first-time founders and we’ve been bootstrapping our startup for the past 5 years during our PhDs.<p>Researchers build their surveys using Google Forms, Qualtrics, SurveyMonkey, Typeform, or another tool; all you need is a survey URL to get started. We verify and monitor participants so you can get data fast (most surveys are completed in &lt;2 hours). Studies range from one-to-one interviews to surveys of thousands of people and you can retarget participants anonymously for follow up studies. You only pay for data you approve. Our business model is to charge a % service charge (typically around 25-35%) on top of rewards researchers pay the participants.<p>We have 70,000+ survey takers in Europe and North America (for distributions of demographic variables see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prolific.co&#x2F;demographics\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prolific.co&#x2F;demographics</a>) and 100s of demographic filters (try our audience checker via <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.prolific.co&#x2F;audience-checker\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.prolific.co&#x2F;audience-checker</a>). This means we can find many target demographics for you. For example, you can filter for Democrats vs. Republicans, old vs. young people, students vs. professionals, different ethnicities, people with health problems, Brexit voters, and even collect nationally representative samples!<p>Anyone can sign up as a participant and start earning a little extra cash.<p>It&#x27;s possible to do research using existing platforms like MTurk. Actually, over 50% of behavioral research is now run online, mostly on MTurk. But there are problems with the quality of data you get from existing platforms, and worse, problems with how the people who participate get treated [1]. Our approach addresses these issues. We think the key differences are:\nIt’s data you can trust: We mandate a minimum hourly reward of $6.50, and often rewards are even higher than that. As a result, participants feel respected and treated like valuable contributors, providing high quality data. We comply with data protection regulation and have a range of technical and behavioral checks in place to ensure high quality data [2].  \nDemographic prescreening is flexible and free: You can easily invite participants for follow-up studies at no extra cost. You can get niche or even nationally representative samples on-demand. \nProlific is built by researchers for researchers. We try to distribute studies as evenly as possible across our participant pool through rate limiting, so have less of a problem with “professional survey takers” than MTurk.<p>Our bigger vision is to build tech infrastructure that empowers behavioral research on the internet. The market opportunity is significant because any individuals, businesses, and governments would benefit from better access to rigorous behavioral data when making decisions. For example, what could we do to best curb climate change? What’s the best way to change unhealthy habits? How can we reduce hate crime and political polarization? The stakes are high, and behavioral research can help us find better answers to these kinds of questions.<p>Moreover, although we built Prolific primarily to help academics, we&#x27;ve noticed that businesses have been using the platform for things like market research and idea validation. This is a new market for us that we&#x27;re excited to explore. We’d love to hear about any ideas, experiences, and feedback you might have.

You can see who&#x27;s online this second and talk&#x2F;video&#x2F;screenshare in one click.<p>What&#x27;s unique about us is you can see what app your colleagues are working in (e.g. VS Code, Google Docs, Figma), which gives you a surprisingly clear sense of whether you can interrupt them or not. In fact, we&#x27;ve found it makes you feel like you&#x27;re sitting around a table, without being overly invasive.<p>We started building Tandem when two of us had kids and started working from home more. We tried a bunch of different tools - Zoom, Discord, Slack, Hangouts, etc. -  but hated the friction in all of them.<p>We felt slower, less collaborative, and more alone when we worked remotely. We built a one-click calling prototype, added video and screenshare, and this eventually became Tandem.<p>Some details on how instant calls work:\n- You can click on someone and talk immediately, but they will be on mute until they accept.\n- All calls start as voice, but can be upgraded to video and screenshare.\n- Customizable rooms are a nice way to invite teammates to talk when they&#x27;re free.<p>Some details on app presence:\n- Your teammates will be able to see which work app you&#x27;re currently in (only for a select set of integrated apps) - this gives everyone a sense of being together, and helps you know when a teammate is interruptible. \n- You can go into Focus Mode if you don&#x27;t want to be bothered, in which case your app will not be shown.<p>Pricing: 14 day free trial, then $10 &#x2F; active user &#x2F; month<p>We are doing a beta program where, if you can hop on a short feedback call every-other week, we extend the free trial indefinitely!

We make it easier to get your first job.<p>More specifically, we help talented engineers who may not shine in traditional recruitment processes (resume + multiple interview processes) get opportunities to prove themselves on the job. We do this by using a practical skill-based assessment as a proxy for the resume, and then matching them to startups for paid internships, as a way to reduce full-time interview processes.<p>As a new grad without relevant work experience, or as a career shifter without a relevant degree, getting a first job is very painful. You spend months preparing for interviews that don’t reflect the job, you send hundreds of resumes out that go unanswered, and when you actually get interviews, getting through five rounds successfully is like a lottery.<p>I’ve been interested in this problem for a long time because of my own early struggles trying to get a job. I graduated from a foreign university (Canada), had a subpar GPA, and I don’t perform well in high-pressured style interviews. Somehow, I networked my way into getting interviews at all my “dream” companies. But I got rejected at every one of them and to this day, I’ve never gotten a job I’ve interviewed for. It deeply affected my confidence.<p>However, since then I was fortunate enough to start and exit a startup. We built a fashion app that made personal outfit recommendations based on your likes, which eventually evolved into a chatbot that provided recommendations to hundreds of thousands of teens. We got acquired, and when I was working for the company that acquired us, I finally realized that the interviews I&#x27;d failed at hadn’t reflected my ability to do well on the job.<p>Mainstream hiring processes are biased towards those who went to great schools, had high GPAs, are native-English speaking, have worked at brand name companies, are extroverts and great networkers, etc. But there are so many talented people who don&#x27;t fit that profile. We&#x27;re excited to work on ways of hiring that give them a better chance.<p>Our practical skill-based assessments simulate tasks they’d actually be doing on the job (e.g. project-based work). Engineers on our end review the job seeker’s code to pick up signals that are important for on-the-job such as: ability to follow a spec, code quality and how quickly the task is completed. An employer pays 90% of the cost only when a full-time hire is made, so ensuring that candidates have job-ready skills is crucial for us. We&#x27;ve found that it works to give people the opportunity to prove themselves on the job: 80% of our internships have resulted in full-time employment immediately after.<p>So far, we have helped talented engineers get software jobs who would have otherwise been overlooked: baristas and Uber drivers turned engineers, candidates with no local experience (from Turkey, India, Russia, Ethiopia, Brazil etc.), and those with non-CS degrees (linguistics, philosophy, economics, MBA’s, dentistry, mechanical engineering etc.)<p>I’d love to hear your thoughts and ideas about how we can improve this system and how we can best help talented people who shine once they get a chance to prove themselves. We would love to hear your personal experiences in this space too.

On top of that, I fear I&#x27;m not smart enough to do a lot of the stuff and feel like a proverbial &quot;code monkey&quot;.<p>At this point I&#x27;m wondering if I should just leave tech, but the lost earning potential tells me that would be financial suicide (where else can you make that much money with nothing but a HS diploma),but I&#x27;m just not sure, and feel I may be overreacting or not seeing some option, I know other people have been in similar situations, and I&#x27;m curious if anyone could lend me some advice.","time":1564533970,"title":"Ask HN: Don't want to write CRUD apps for the rest of my career, what to do?","type":"story"},{"by":"causehealth101","descendants":2,"id":20570576,"kids":[20570721,20570870],"score":2,"text":"Whether you were on the hiring or candidate side, I&#x27;m curious to hear your thoughts&#x2F;experiences.<p>Let&#x27;s say the company uses Node, Angular, and MongoDB:<p>Candidate #1: Above average Senior-level Engineer with matching background in Node, Angular, MongoDB.<p>Candidate #1: Excellent Senior-level Engineer, but background is mainly in Ruby, React, and Postgres.<p>And please contribute any other of the countless permutations!

HN! I&#x27;m Jason, one of the co-founders of FeaturePeek (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;featurepeek.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;featurepeek.com</a>).<p>FeaturePeek lets front-end developers get UI&#x2F;UX feedback from their team earlier in the release cycle. For every pull request, we spin up a dedicated feature environment with tools like commenting, screenshotting, and bug filing overlaid on top.<p>Our vision is to fill the void in product development that occurs after developer handoff. Great tools exist for design prototyping (Sketch), design feedback (InVision), developer handoff (Zeplin)... but then there&#x27;s a cliff, an empty gap, where teams use ad-hoc methods of iteration before shipping. We want to build a tool that shortens feedback loops between cross-functional teams so that the end of the release cycle is sane and stress-free.<p>If you&#x27;re familiar with automatic feature environments for pull requests — like what Heroku or Netlify offer — it&#x27;s like that, but 1) we&#x27;re platform agnostic, 2) we support Dockerized builds in addition to pure static assets, and 3) we overlay a suite of tools on top of each environment to help your team communicate more effectively.<p>My co-founder Eric and I wished that this existed at our last startup. While developing a web-based SaaS product, we found that our teammates would wait until the day before the release to leave implementation feedback on new features. The feedback ranged anywhere from CSS nits to the dreadful &quot;This isn&#x27;t what I meant&quot;, in which case we had to decide whether to scramble together a fix or to delay the release. It was tempting to fault the procrastinating reviewers, but it happened so often that we realized it was instead a flaw in the review process. We knew there had to be a better way.<p>Eric has led Build &amp; Integration teams at Apple and has experience in release management. My background is in front-end engineering and developer experience. So it was natural for us to think in terms of developer tools for release processes, and we decided to work on this together.<p>There are a few products that exist for gathering website feedback and filing bugs, but they all rely on using a browser extension in a dev&#x2F;staging environment. This method is inferior because 1) Getting everyone on your team to install a browser extension on every browser is a pain; 2) Code has already been reviewed and merged, which is way too late to start the feedback process. Waiting on code review before conducting feature review is an unnecessary speed bump; and 3) Dev&#x2F;staging environments can be an integration war zone, especially for larger teams. Another developer&#x27;s feature could break something in yours, so this environment is not suitable for conducting feature review. QA should still happen on the release as a whole, but the UI&#x2F;UX review of individual features should occur in isolation.<p>Here&#x27;s how it works: After your pull request builds in CI, call our one-liner to ping our services. We use the credentials present in your CI environment to pull your image from your container registry. If you build static content, we download your built assets and add them to an nginx image for you. When the environment is up, a deployment link posts in the pull request, and your team is notified via Slack. We use Kubernetes and Helm to manage and namespace each environment, which spin up and shut down based on VCS webhooks. Our team collaboration features sit on top of your app in a parent frame, so you don&#x27;t need to install any run-time dependencies to take advantage of them.<p>All new teams get a two-week free trial — but you can use the coupon code HN2019 to get an additional 50% off your first three months.<p>We&#x27;d love to hear your feedback, and answer any questions you may have :-)","time":1564506077,"title":"Launch HN: FeaturePeek (YC S19) – Front-end review for the whole team","type":"story"},{"by":"turrini","descendants":109,"id":20566779,"kids":[20568323,20570724,20568741,20570418,20568267,20568664,20567836,20571863,20569051,20568479,20583141,20568350,20567856,20570486,20569321,20568746,20568422,20568522,20572676,20570134,20573656,20569474,20569334,20568480,20569160,20568277],"score":284,"time":1564506039,"title":"Technician keeps computer made in 1959 still humming along","type":"story","url":"http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201907280007.html"},{"by":"jann","descendants":13,"id":20566536,"kids":[20566821,20566587,20566651,20566588,20566643,20566544,20566641,20566866,20566580,20567604,20567110,20566825,20566573],"score":33,"time":1564504744,"title":"Stackoverflow is down","type":"story","url":"https://stackoverflow.com/error?aspxerrorpath=/"},{"by":"AnatMl2","descendants":19,"id":20566499,"kids":[20568320,20567422,20567745,20567850,20568533,20567428,20568757,20568842,20569525,20569126,20568822,20572109,20568765,20567977],"score":47,"time":1564504482,"title":"Facebook is exploring brain control for AR wearables","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/30/facebook-is-exploring-brain-control-for-ar-wearables/"},{"by":"dbcooper","descendants":19,"id":20566395,"kids":[20567017,20566442,20567447,20566918,20566720,20567206,20566745,20566678,20566397],"score":27,"time":1564503885,"title":"DNA sequencing progress has stagnated","type":"story","url":"https://twitter.com/erlichya/status/1156195896067088394"},{"by":"swalsh","descendants":17,"id":20566181,"kids":[20567837,20570730,20573404,20568639,20569876,20567078,20566553],"score":27,"text":"In 2012 PG wrote an essay about Frighteningly Ambitious Startup Ideas (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;ambitious.html)<p>Many of the items have been tackled (though admitedly perhaps not that successful yet).

The founder ran a lab and the cofounder was a doctor with impressive credentials. The vision was big and I quit my job to work for no pay without a formalized position. We converted the founder&#x27;s basement into an office, got an interview with YC, and few $100K investment and few $M pre-money valuation from 500 Startups. From the outside, we&#x27;re rockin&#x27; &amp; rollin&#x27;<p>As can be expected, internally things are much less smooth. I am the only full-time person (85+ hours&#x2F;wk), the doctor cofounder doesn&#x27;t really participating (~5 hrs&#x2F;wk, 6% equity) and the main founder is scattered between his lab &amp; another company (&gt;60%). He&#x27;s great at selling the vision and getting ppl pumped up, but is not present much for day-to-day tasks like customer discovery, product development, pitch materials etc. He just offered me 0.5% for my contribution over the last 5 months and the title of COO &amp; 1st employee (previously PM).<p>I have a feeling that this dynamic is not right. My last startup disbanded after we couldn&#x27;t resolve the unequal contribution problem, and I don&#x27;t want to repeat that mistake. Of course, I should have gotten equity in writing sooner- but that issue might be rooted in a deeper problem. I feel like a solopreneur most of the time, doing most of the heavy lifting to build the care of the company, not like a first employee with little impact on the company. If I leave, progress will nearly come to a halt. I want to stay, but I&#x27;m concerned about this dynamic.<p>Do any of you have a similar experience or can offer some advice as to what I should do in this situation?

Then, when you learn what works, you simply do <i>more</i> of it. \nFollow through on this idea of imposing &quot;fun&quot; at work and you risk alienating all your best engineers.<p>Considering how STEM fields naturally attract introverts, shouldn&#x27;t managers at companies avoid or at least make their supposedly fun activities not mandatory?

I&#x27;m not a CS major and I&#x27;m generally a novice at software engineering, so I have no idea if what I&#x27;m proposing is crazy or not)<p>I&#x27;ve been noticing the increase in projects using Go seemingly to replace other existing projects written in Python. Go seems to have a strong following now due to a couple of useful features, but it&#x27;s still a new language, whereas Python is an established language that many people enjoy writing code in. The question is, could Python be updated to include the kinds of core features that make Go attractive, while still retaining its Pythonisms?<p>Go&#x27;s strengths seem to be in its static types, concurrency features, static analysis tools, lack of generics, and compiled binaries. I could be wrong, but it seems like all of these (save maybe the improved concurrency) could be added to Python and be a strong competitor to Go. Most of the language could remain the same, but it could then be adopted in places that Go is gaining a foothold. The main purpose would be to increase the utility of the existing body of knowledge around Python, and increase its usefulness.<p>Am I crazy?","time":1564148811,"title":"Ask HN: Could Python be reborn in the image of Go?","type":"story"},{"by":"ricklamers","descendants":15,"id":20534729,"kids":[20535472,20546264,20536047,20546150,20541340,20540792,20541639,20536191,20535733,20539498],"score":84,"time":1564148716,"title":"Show HN: I built a spreadsheet app with Python to make data science easier","type":"story","url":"https://hackernoon.com/introducing-grid-studio-a-spreadsheet-app-with-python-to-make-data-science-easier-tdup38f7"},{"by":"prostoalex","descendants":17,"id":20534634,"kids":[20539743,20539879,20541436,20541547,20541146,20539973],"score":96,"time":1564147995,"title":"The Aesthetic Beauty of Math","type":"story","url":"https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2019/07/22/the-aesthetic-beauty-of-math/"},{"by":"bfoks","descendants":27,"id":20534551,"kids":[20535062,20535333,20535046,20534897,20564119,20534799,20540319,20555451,20565728,20541723,20535075,20535988,20563249,20540497,20536330,20548228,20548804,20540326,20534821,20551895,20540280],"score":20,"text":"I&#x27;m currently reading Arnold Schwarzenegger’s and really enjoying it.

For example, Vue was extremely hyped up but React quickly won out for most real world applications. Same goes for numerous new frameworks and libraries, as I&#x27;m sure you all know. My question is if we could come up with some sort of a framework of criteria to help us determine if and when we should start trying to apply the &#x27;next big thing&#x27; in our real projects.

Looking forward to hearing how everyone approaches this.","time":1564080875,"title":"Keeping Up with Coding Ecosystem","type":"story"},{"by":"est31","descendants":81,"id":20528106,"kids":[20529065,20529232,20529282,20532632,20533238,20529383,20529591,20529139,20530007,20529239,20532702,20529386],"score":190,"time":1564079813,"title":"What an attacker gets from Apple devices if they sniff Bluetooth traffic","type":"story","url":"https://hexway.io/blog/apple-bleee/"},{"by":"methuselah","descendants":3,"id":20528055,"kids":[20532552,20528431],"score":13,"time":1564079505,"title":"Superconductivity at Room Temperature Pressure","type":"story","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/finally-iisc-team-confirms-superconductivity-at-room-temperature-pressure/article27246496.ece"},{"by":"pseudolus","descendants":2,"id":20527990,"kids":[20528039,20538476],"score":3,"time":1564079099,"title":"A World Without Mad Magazine","type":"story","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/a-world-without-mad-magazine"},{"by":"smacktoward","descendants":3,"id":20528130,"kids":[20530279,20530300],"score":75,"time":1564079953,"title":"In Order to Become More Competitive We've Decided To Make Your Job Worse","type":"story","url":"https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/in-order-to-become-more-competitive-in-our-sector-weve-decided-to-make-a-series-of-terrible-decisions-that-will-make-your-job-way-worse"},{"by":"burlesona","descendants":247,"id":20527867,"kids":[20529192,20529122,20529643,20528964,20527955,20529067,20531698,20530208,20531906,20531818,20529839,20530647,20529714,20532617,20530157,20528772],"score":174,"time":1564078423,"title":"Approaching Peak Housing Dysfunction in California","type":"story","url":"https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2019/7/24/approaching-peak-housing-dysfunction-in-california"},{"by":"pseudolus","descendants":5,"id":20527732,"kids":[20528481,20528359,20530812],"score":26,"time":1564077550,"title":"Earth had a near-miss with 'city-killer' asteroid this morning","type":"story","url":"https://www.smh.com.au/national/earth-had-a-near-miss-with-city-killer-asteroid-this-morning-20190725-p52apn.html"},{"by":"CPLX","descendants":42,"id":20527665,"kids":[20528848,20529532,20529406,20528453,20528902,20529486,20536486,20528765],"score":57,"time":1564077108,"title":"They Said You Could Leave Scooters Anywhere, Then the Repo Men Struck Back","type":"story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20696405/dockless-scooters-share-repo-men-repossessor-lawsuit-tow-yard-lime-bird-lyft-uber-razor"},{"by":"wmhorne","descendants":10,"id":20527650,"kids":[20527870,20529395,20530651,20528255,20535840,20528352,20530667],"score":46,"text":"What prevented Plan 9 from Bell Labs from becoming a widely-used operating system?

This will require you to make a change in your account before August 7, 2019, to avoid a disruption in service. Please continue reading to learn more about what you need to do.<p>What’s changed\nWhen we were an email-only company, your audience was made up of contacts who were subscribed. However, we now offer features that go beyond email. So, while you can&#x27;t send emails to your non-subscribed or unsubscribed contacts, you may still be able to engage them through other touchpoints, like ads or postcards.<p>Since non-subscribed and unsubscribed contacts have value, they’re now included as contacts in your audience. As a customer on a free plan, you’re allowed up to 2,000 total contacts in your audience. As of July 22, your account has 1,890 subscribed contacts, 0 non-subscribed contacts, and 1,165 unsubscribed contacts for a total of 3,055 contacts in your audience.<p>Since your account is above the 2,000 contact maximum for our free plan, you’ll either need to upgrade to a paid plan or archive some of your contacts to remain on the free plan.","time":1564012982,"title":"Mailchimp sent me this today.

We’re Vaibhav and Richard, founders of Simmer (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;usesimmer.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;usesimmer.com</a>).\nSimmer aggregates dishes from DoorDash, Caviar, GrubHub, and basically every other delivery platform out there, and tells users the best dishes across the board. We do this by providing dish-level reviews.<p>Users find highly reviewed dishes on Simmer, choose the delivery platform of their liking, and we deep link them into their chosen delivery app. We essentially lead gen to delivery.<p>We started working on Simmer because we loved trying new restaurants, but never knew what to order. Especially, when there’s a 5 page menu. We always asked ourselves, “Why aren’t there ratings for individual dishes?”<p>We launched our app with this restaurant-centric use case (reviews for every dish at every restaurant), but when we rolled out delivery integrations, we realized that users resonated most with the delivery angle. They found it particularly difficult to find great dishes on delivery (after all, there are no waiters to give you recommendations).<p>As a result, we have doubled down  on becoming an aggregator of delivery dishes across platforms. So far, the app features hundreds of restaurants (and even more dishes) that deliver in New York, Chicago, and San Francisco.<p>We’re a young company trying to foster positivity and appreciation of food, but we have a lot to learn. So if you are a big eater, order in a bunch, are indecisive like us, or just want to know what the best dishes are nearby, do check out the app!

Sexual harassment is essentially a power imbalance.<p>2. Eliminating sexual harassment is not by policing the dominant gender, but by stripping the power away from the ‘harassement’ part.<p>3. When will harassment disappear? Would it be true to state that harassment will cease to exist in the absence of an aggrieved party?<p>4. How can one not feel victimized and not aggrieved? I feel like it’a mostly because of the shame associated with sexuality and sex.<p>5. This seems to be a function of religious morality. Segregation on the basis of gender seems to have religious roots. It’s mostly an offshoot of Abrahamic religions.(original sin) As they spread, other organized religions also seemed to adopt this.<p>Example: Indian Hindu temples are full of erotic sculptures and entire treatises that see sexuality as pleasure and not guilt&#x2F;shame. Somewhere down the centuries, as it became streamlined as an organized religion, it became a prudish as the new religions.<p>6. I only got to this point. I couldn’t figure out the rest as I felt blocked going down that thought rabbit hole.<p>My gut feeling is that the root of sexual segregation and shame and harassment is perceived and imposed morality and adoption of mass values.<p>This seems to have developed along with religion all around the world. Almost parallels..<p>Are atheistic ‘godless heathen’ societies that are sexually liberated less likely to witness sexual harassment?<p>The Bible and Koran and many other religions’ books have awful things written about women. Are there any religions that treat men and women equally?<p>Women check out men too and desire them..but why don’t they ‘harass’ them?<p>Why cannot we live by our personal moral codes? Is there an evolutionary advantage to sexual segregation and discrimination and harassment?<p>If there wasn’t, it wouldn’t have survived for so long.

But why? In this [1] Quora question a person claims to have gotten an answer from NTSB. They have two main arguments:<p>1. Data is too big that we don&#x27;t have technology to deal with that much information<p>2. There are security concerns since people can intercept data.<p>I don&#x27;t understand either of the arguments. Here are my thoughts:<p>1. Some basic search [2] leads us that there are approx in the order of 10k airplanes in the sky. Assuming there are no periods of time where flight traffic is orders of magnitude worse (since countries live in different timezones) seems like the problem we&#x27;re trying to solve is streaming data from 10k clients. Assuming the biggest bandwidth bottleneck will be audio (since there is no video data and physical data is relatively cheap) we can reduce this problem to streaming movie from 10k clients at any given time. It seems like one way to verify this problem is tractable is counting how many people uploading video to youtube any given moment and finding out the delta between total video length and transmission latency. While I don&#x27;t have any real numbers, it seems like a tractable problem.<p>2. Similarly, this seems like a problem that we already should be able to solve. AES encrypted keyboards, encrypted mouses etc come to mind; or even basic HTTPS.<p>Could someone please explain this layman why this problem is so hard?

The hardware platform itself is allowed to take away resources. This means that NO other RT kernel can make those guarantees either on the same hardware. For example many modern devices (including the BIOS firmware itself) make use of internal micro controllers which can generated NMIs (non maskable interrupts) during which control of the system is taken away in order to handling anything from overheating events to completion of a DMA read&#x2F;write from an I&#x2F;O or network device into a shared memory buffer to TLB access or CPU cache flushes. Since there are no guarantees from the platform the OS can&#x27;t guarantee it either regardless of what those people who provide support for micro-kernel hosts would have you believe. RT-Linux itself uses a mechanism that provides a real-time scheduler though its timing guarantees are slower because of overhead they are just as &quot;hard&quot; as the micro kernel solutions on a given hardware platform.<p>If you need true RT support you basically are limited to hardware which allows the guarantees to be made, and the RT Linux solution is good enough for the vast majority of solutions.
