The CEO is under a lot of pressure from the board to release new features.\nA couple days ago I had a meeting with our CEO to plan a major development of our infrastructure. Basically, she wanted to cross-check what my technical supervisor had already told her. During the whole meeting her hands were shaking. My feeling is that she now distrusts the entire team.\nShe was a great leader when I joined the company a couple years ago, and I had a lot of respect for her. Now she is asking for major technical changes that make no sense at all, neither from a technical nor a business point of view -- without referring to the technical team.\nI&#x27;m not a physician, but this looks like a burnout-in-progress to me.

I mean the complete opposite of &quot;flimsy&quot;; it could be heavy, I don&#x27;t mind (at most, I&#x27;ll move it from one room to another), so weight is not an issue (as aren&#x27;t processing power - an i3 or equivalent would be sufficient - or sufficient RAM - 8GB would be great, but I&#x27;d be willing to go for 4).<p>Your insights in this matter are greatly appreciated!","time":1467138163,"title":"Ask HN: Recommendations for a SOLID laptop","type":"story"},{"by":"coloneltcb","descendants":51,"id":11996151,"kids":[11997326,11997142,11997374,11997276,11997232,11997359,11997490,11997130,11997782,11997158],"score":35,"time":1467138065,"title":"Airbnb Is Said to Be Seeking Funding Valuing It at $30B","type":"story","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/29/business/dealbook/airbnb-is-said-to-be-seeking-funding-valuing-it-at-30-billion.html?_r=0"},{"by":"Chris911","descendants":68,"id":11996031,"kids":[11996387,11998996,11999001,11996367,11999354,11997257,11999534,11999147,11998591,11997578,11999437],"score":194,"time":1467137173,"title":"GitHub's 2015 Transparency Report","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/blog/2202-github-s-2015-transparency-report"},{"by":"mr_tyzic","descendants":29,"id":11995966,"kids":[11996634,11997598,11996407,11996432,11996586,11996467,11998278,12000148,11996377,11998011,11998169,11996318,11999972],"score":84,"time":1467136845,"title":"The Tyranny of the Clock – Ivan Sutherland (2012) [pdf]","type":"story","url":"http://worrydream.com/refs/Sutherland%20-%20Tyranny%20of%20the%20Clock.pdf"},{"by":"latimer","descendants":127,"id":11995904,"kids":[11997438,11997656,11997514,11997762,11998165,11997502,11997455,11998498,11997447,11999464,11999078],"score":109,"time":1467136418,"title":"Lending Club plans layoffs, discloses loans to former CEO and family members","type":"story","url":"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-lending-club-layoffs-20160628-snap-story.html"},{"by":"jeffbarr","descendants":10,"id":11995866,"kids":[11997967,12024311,11997988,11997917],"score":82,"time":1467136235,"title":"Elastic Network Adapter – High Performance Network Interface for EC2","type":"story","url":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/elastic-network-adapter-high-performance-network-interface-for-amazon-ec2/"},{"by":"gtirloni","descendants":650,"id":11995816,"kids":[11996380,11998116,11997722,11996182,11997505,11997058,11996885,11996340,11997496,11996565,11995933,11998350,11998081,11996313,11996608,11996981,11997322,11996576,11997288,11997334,11996628,11996755,11996737,11998718,11997481,11996300,11995975,11998697,11998422,11997245,11995995,11997168,11997561,11998769,11996359,11998309,11996691,11997240,11996651,11995991,11998993,11996525,11996816,11996070,11996012,11999392,11996421,11996081,11997441,11998690,11997382,11997315,11997799,11997833,11999537,11996071,11997987,11997338,11996585,11998978,11997191,11996868,11997371,11998122,11996109,11997730,11996365,11998623,11998173,11998264,11997102,11997449,11999331,11996251,12000236,11998842,11999919,11996406,11997821,11997188,11996618,11996008,11999017,11997090,12000278,11997066,11996888,11996919,11996700,12018289,12000204,11999029,11999028,11996358,11996511,11996940,11997453,11998905,11996091,11997209,11996321,11996810,11998648,12001336,11998093,11996633,12000177,11998949,11997832,11998923,11996587,11998446,11999927,11996500,11997153,11998177,11998414,11997495,12000246,12000400,12001394,11997216,11998799,11996424,11996389,11996960,12001466,11998828,11996309,11998749,12021811,11999105,11997244,12017860,12000200,11998447,12000008,11996763,11997053,11998461,11995937,11997082,11997953,11999728,11996619,11996632,11998607,11997283,11997470,11996528,11998812,11999879,11995985,11996744,11999563,11997546,11998863,11997456,11998552,11998341,12003280,11996223,11996972,11996245,11997039,11997760,11996715,11996592,11998417,11996226,12001252,12000100,11998124,11998468,12000566,11997515,11996418,12000063,11996190,11998481,11996575,11998670,12000089,11996137,11998673,11997055,12029847,11997747,11997738,11997830,11997192,11998225,11997160,11997009,11996623,11997046,11998478,12000452,11999459,11998443,11997054,12002402,11997482,11996504,11995935,12000062,11998777,11998172,11999527,11998296,12001398,11997410,11998902,11996642,11997154,12003835,11999877,11997011,11996060,11996857,11997853,11997428,11998348,11997032,11996741,11999512,11998914,12000347,11998770,11996308,11999984,11996072,11997214,12000775,11996486],"score":247,"text":"There is so much broken software out there that sometimes it can feel a bit overwhelming and depressing if you have been &#x27;yak shaving&#x27;

As professionals. we deride RAD tools and &quot;drag and drop&quot; development, and show geek love for ever-more abstract modes of thinking like Functional Programming that a small percentage of working developers, let alone the general public, will grasp.<p>What&#x27;s the end-game? Are we trying to create a new cognitive elite? Is it a labor lottery so that the small percentage of kids who are turn out to be good at coding will become professional programmers? Are we willfully blind to the fact that human talent is not evenly distributed? Or is the lack of accessibility (&quot;easiness&quot;) just a blind spot that we have yet to address?","time":1467077807,"title":"Ask HN: How to reconcile “teach everyone to code” and “only hire the top 1%”?","type":"story"},{"by":"tonteldoos","descendants":14,"id":11990779,"kids":[11991086,11990916,11990867,11991758,11996853,11990840],"score":10,"text":"Good day all,<p>I&#x27;m doing some research for a friend who&#x27;s kids are starting to use the interwebs, and was wondering what the current state of parental control packages are, specifically:<p><pre><code>  1] What would HN recommend (off-the-shelf solutions - see below)\n  2] How well do the packages work that you&#x27;ve actually used\n  3] How do they compare costwise\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m capable of setting up a proxy and filter for them, but for their own reasons, they would prefer off-the-shelf solutions (Windows and&#x2F;or Mac).<p>As always, thanks for your input!<p>EDIT: If HN is aware of off-the-shelf solutions that will cover an entire home network (in the way a proxy solution could), please do share.","time":1467075984,"title":"Ask HN: Current state of parental internet control?","type":"story"},{"by":"wlrm","descendants":3,"id":11990771,"kids":[11991312,11990923],"score":11,"time":1467075865,"title":"IRS hacked again – say goodbye to that PIN system","type":"story","url":"https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/06/27/irs-hacked-again-say-goodbye-to-that-pin-system/"},{"by":"hunvreus","descendants":203,"id":11990721,"kids":[11991020,11992440,11991150,11991478,11992067,11991349,11993869,11991197,11992241,11991201,11993032,11991132,11991666,11991867,11991196,11994124,11992525,11991209,11992252,11991715,11996483,11992094,11991316,11995545,11991153,11991437,11991536],"score":225,"time":1467074952,"title":"Bushido: Way of Total Bullshit","type":"story","url":"https://www.tofugu.com/japan/bushido/"},{"by":"hvo","dead":true,"id":11990710,"kids":[11990773,11990769],"score":1,"time":1467074789,"title":"Artificial Intelligence’s White Guy Problem","type":"story","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/26/opinion/sunday/artificial-intelligences-white-guy-problem.html?ref=technology&_r=0"},{"by":"tonteldoos","descendants":4,"id":11990646,"kids":[11993170,11991063],"score":7,"time":1467073929,"title":"Russian robot escapes lab.

(It wasn&#x27;t easy.) It had ambiguous licensing and copyright associated with it, which made me leery of using it for production tasks. He gave me explicit written permission to rename, open source[0], and relicense under a permissive license[1]. He also relinquished the copyright. I&#x27;ve also published a nuget package under the new name, Ical.Net[2]. The trouble is that if you look at the download stats, the older, buggy, under-performing library has many tens of thousands of downloads. It has a gravity to it that my library doesn&#x27;t. How do I close the gap, and give people confidence that it&#x27;s safe (and preferable) to use my library instead?<p>* It&#x27;s unencumbered by licensing and copyright issues.<p>* It performs significantly better.

This way you can get answers from the active maintainers of the repo&#x2F;code and don&#x27;t have to wish that somehow they see it on SO (and not break rules by posting questions in Issues tab).<p>What do you think? What are the pros and cons of such feature?","time":1466855112,"title":"Ask HN: Pros and Cons if GitHub were to add a Q/A tab like the “Issues” tab?","type":"story"},{"by":"taigeair","descendants":6,"id":11975898,"kids":[11975942,11976018,11981886,11981160],"score":4,"text":"I am puzzled why so many people have tattoos.

Clearing up some of the misconceptions could be helpful to those of you in this community who might benefit from these routes to a green card. So if you&#x27;re interested, ask me particularly about that, but I&#x27;ll be happy to answer about U.S. immigration in general.  As before, I can’t comment or provide legal advice on specific cases for obvious liability reasons because I won’t have access to all the facts.<p>EDIT: Thank you for participating in this AMA.

I was wondering if people have any recommendations on: \n    1) Books with a general overview of the healthcare system, focusing on US but perhaps with some excursions into global healthcare.\n    2) Books from an <i>engineer&#x27;s perspective</i> on the healthcare industry, or something that covers predictions on the future of healthcare, including avenues of technical&#x2F;healthcare innovation and legal&#x2F;structural changes.<p>I know there are a lot of books out there about healthcare, but a lot of them seem to be about certain very specific issues, and not a general introduction. This book (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wiley.com&#x2F;WileyCDA&#x2F;WileyTitle&#x2F;productCd-1118971086.html), for example, seems to be a type of book I&#x27;m looking for, but I can&#x27;t find any review of this one anywhere online. I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations?<p>Thanks a bunch.","time":1466757983,"title":"Ask HN: An engineer's perspective on healthcare","type":"story"},{"by":"imartin2k","descendants":5,"id":11967738,"kids":[11967874,11967854,11967984],"score":5,"time":1466755685,"title":"With a single vote, England just screwed us all","type":"story","url":"http://fusion.net/story/318538/england-brexit-screwed-us-all/"},{"by":"frankacter","descendants":2,"id":11967845,"kids":[11967981,11967851],"score":4,"time":1466757116,"title":"Introducing Soylent 1.6","type":"story","url":"http://blog.soylent.com/post/146357422357/introducing-soylent-16-powder/?"},{"by":"akhilaryan","descendants":3,"id":11967552,"kids":[11967586,11967662,11967689],"score":117,"time":1466753908,"title":"ChatBots and the future of Apps in India","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/haptik-inc/chatbots-the-future-of-apps-in-india-fddcc1aa2a97#.jmx2klr7d"},{"by":"matheusalmeida","descendants":337,"id":11967478,"kids":[11967844,11967529,11968184,11967674,11967974,11967567,11967912,11968245,11968088,11970318,11967876,11971523,11968051,11969683,11967621,11967600,11969373,11967603],"score":403,"time":1466753196,"title":"David Cameron announces resignation","type":"story","url":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/david-cameron-resigns-after-uk-votes-to-leave-european-union"},{"by":"bootload","descendants":2,"id":11967273,"kids":[11967382,11967353],"score":5,"time":1466750964,"title":"Russian science is amazing.

I&#x27;d rather not go into the why <i>(for fear of sounding like a sob story)</i>, but suffice it to say i&#x27;m far older than my resume would lead you to believe. Despite all of that, i am very fortunate that a position fell into my lap in a startup, and i moved my way into an engineer position, to which i&#x27;m doing alright. I&#x27;ve been there many years, but now, i&#x27;m looking to move on to a new job.<p>With that said, i feel like a CS fraud. My knowledge of computer science is woefully small, and competency i do feel i have is purely in building apps and <i>(thankfully)</i> writing clean code. However, i fear that clean code won&#x27;t get me through an interview process. Memory management, bit shifting, algorithm design and computational cost, these are the things i&#x27;m terrible at and would love to feel competent at. So, i am attempting to fix that.<p>I&#x27;ve picked up a book about interview questions as recommended by a friend <i>(Cracking the Code Interview, for those interested)</i>, and now i want to get a more focused understanding of computer science.<p>Are there any CS MOOC courses that you would recommend? I am hoping to find not only a good course, but one that will also teach me the fundamentals i&#x27;m missing.

This projects do have their advantages as I discover new ways to do things that are very beneficial to my work projects but for my personal projects and personal life they are a dead end.<p>Do any of you experience this, do you just push it to the back of your mind and push on forward or is it just that am a coward?","time":1466503626,"title":"Ask HN: As a programmer do you have ups and downs and periods of intense doubt?","type":"story"},{"by":"lisper","descendants":8,"id":11944087,"kids":[11944212,11944478],"score":9,"time":1466494674,"title":"Apple bricked my MacBook and there's nothing I can do about it","type":"story","url":"http://blog.rongarret.info/2016/06/apple-bricked-my-macbook-and-theres.html"},{"by":"zolder","descendants":340,"id":11944011,"kids":[11944105,11944701,11944101,11944800,11944164,11944106,11948271,11944249,11945857,11944425,11944261,11944680,11944132,11944781,11945108,11944246,11944811,11947453,11944133,11944823,11944161,11944972,11945050,11945606,11944482,11945237,11948566,11946874,11946310,11944977,11952177,11946577,11946115,11953886,11946013,11944224,11944307,11947203,11945192,11945424,11945129,11944259,11944190],"score":1030,"time":1466493380,"title":"“PayPal has demanded that we monitor data traffic as well as customers’ files”","type":"story","url":"https://seafile.de/en/important-infos-about-app-seafile-de-and-licensing-purchases-through-our-web-shops/"},{"by":"dhruvkar","descendants":12,"id":11944003,"kids":[11946685,11944032,11946072,11945173,11944019],"score":8,"text":"I work in the construction (specifically natural stone) industry and am working on an API for the names, colors, &amp; origination of different types of granite and marble.

I also like working close with developers and help them with their dev environments, also with issues with scaling or helping them to debug code.  Right now I am working for a large corporate company.  They are using a lot of interesting technology docker, coreos, kubernetes but though the technology is really cool, it is not setup properly, it is hard to get something done because there is so much process to get changes into production, so things that at a startup would take me a week it takes 2 months to see them here in production at this new job.   Most of the time the Ops team is putting out fires , we also don&#x27;t have any type of architecture meetings or one on ones,  So I am struggling to see visibility to my work.<p>I just got offered a role at a startup as the only DevOps engineer so they want someone to come in and start solving problems and we went through some of the problems and it is stuff that I can do with my eyes closed.

Should he pay them all off before quitting his job?\n - We have another $50,000 of money in 401(k)s and Roth IRAs. We&#x27;re young enough to lose all this money and make it back without concern.

I&#x27;ve encountered a native startup, in the Eastern side of the European Union, who are doing full-time, non-academic programming courses for people of my age. They look promising, start off by quickly building foundations with processor basics, memory handling, i&#x2F;o, blocking, caches, linux, windows and cloud, algorithms, then move onto technologies and methodologies such as python, agile, UI&#x2F;UX, git, javascript, HTML, XML, Rest, Json, SQL and noSQL alike. After about 6-7 months they move onto OOP, and the students essentially end up as junior C# or Java developers with adequate knowledge to get internships at local companies (the startup sources you as interns, so no need for job search) who are desperate for proven quick learners. During your work at the IT company, you start paying off tuition fees monthly, at a reasonable rate, with no contract binding you to the company.<p>My ultimate goal would be to get a quick and focused programming education in a controlled environment (1.5yrs overall for the course), then by end of 2018 to leave for Switzerland. I would pay my tuition fees from there. I have no formal education in IT&#x2F;CS, and my unfinished university studies were in unrelated fields. I do have several years of experience working in relevant IT positions, however.<p>How hard is it, for a fluent English speaker and EU citizen, to find junior C# (Unity, Xamarin) developer jobs in Switzerland?

For a long time, the large downside to building hybrid apps was that performance -- especially for large apps with lots of custom UI elements -- was unmatched.

It is clear that today was all about very, very deep integrations.

Small team, three&#x2F;four developers depending how you count. Handshake deal said moderate salary until series A but with equity.<p>I&#x27;ve been pushing and pushing for a contract stating the terms, but there always seemed to be something else the CEO had to do. However, I met the rest of the team and it all seemed legitimate.<p>Around the two month mark, I dug my heels in and said contract or I walk. Next day I have a meeting with the CEO and it comes out that there&#x27;s no salaries being paid, people are working for equity. I explain that this isn&#x27;t appropriate for my situation, to which the CEO responds with more work for me to do.<p>Obviously, I should walk away at this point (or ideally weeks before), but there are some twists:<p>1) The work that I produced for them is still mine, as no copyright transfer has been signed. They&#x27;ll almost certainly be trying to sell this &#x2F; bring it to investors.<p>2) It&#x27;s not legal to work only for equity in my country, there&#x27;s a minimum wage, and each employee has to be registered and tax paid on them to the government. I went to apply for unemployment assistance and was told that regardless of whether I was paid, I was considered employed, and thus had no entitlements. Furthermore, as I wasn&#x27;t registered the company was not meeting its tax obligations in hiring me.<p>This brings me to the crux of my problem: If I want to claim unemployment benefit while I look for a real job, I must torpedo the old company. This is bad as it not only can hurt my reputation, it will negatively affect the co-workers who have previously worked for low wage and equity.<p>My feeling is to walk away and cut my losses, but  I thought the community may have other suggestions.<p>Thanks for looking.","time":1465825856,"title":"Ask HN: Should I sell out the startup that misled me?","type":"story"},{"by":"ingve","descendants":27,"id":11893756,"kids":[11894994,11894669,11894130,11895262,11893926,11894982],"score":80,"time":1465825276,"title":"Implementing Queues for Event-Driven Programs","type":"story","url":"http://ithare.com/implementing-queues-for-event-driven-programs/"},{"by":"Dasha_Eltima","descendants":3,"id":11893751,"kids":[11910676,11894790,11900796,11893994],"score":3,"time":1465825242,"title":"CloudMounter: Ultimate cloud manager.

The medium to small companies would only be able to do this incrementally.  What if instead of marketing robot workers to corporations, companies making robots marketed their hardware to individuals?  I have a naive understanding of what is possible with robots these days - but I&#x27;m still of the mindset that it&#x27;s mostly manual labor with repetitive tasks that are easy to automate.<p>I think it&#x27;d be interesting for &quot;the robot company&quot; to market individual robots to blue collar workers that they can use at their job to do their work for them.  The company the worker... works for would essentially be leasing use of the robot from the worker.  The worker then acts as the robot technician.<p>To me this would seem like a much easier way to gradually automate everything without companies having to take the brunt of the costs of buying 2000x robots.  Buying a robot replacement for your own labor would be like mortgaging a house.  You&#x27;d pay off owning that robot over 5-6 years like a car.<p>Maybe this is silly but I could see there being several types of general-purpose robot workers [[someday]] and you apply for jobs based on what robot you have.  &quot;Oh yes, I can offer X company the use of my Masonry Model X7 robot...&quot;  You negotiate a rate for the work your robot will do, and you as the owner ensure that it operates at capacity for the needs of the company.  There&#x27;s also a component in here that if a robot can far outpace a human, the owner of a robot would have more bargaining power because the company wants that level of productivity.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how you&#x27;d handle the problems of having robots and workers working alongside each other.

So on May 24, I registered Mixed Metrics, LLC as a business.

There&#x27;s no need for compiling, building, deploying, or anything like that.

This has been my first job out of college, though I did do freelance work for a few years prior.  I&#x27;m very unhappy at my company, and I&#x27;m wondering whether this is due to the company, or instead due to my own unrealistic expectations.<p>In my organization at this company, each team is assigned one senior engineer, one or more non-senior engineers, and one or more offshore engineers.  On my team, I am the only non-senior engineer, in addition to half a dozen offshore engineers.  In the ~12 months that I&#x27;ve been on my team, 3 senior engineers have joined and subsequently quit, which has left me to learn the ropes of our (unnecessarily large and often undocumented) application and manage all of our offshore engineers on my own.<p>This means that I usually work significantly more than 8 hours per day (8 hours is the norm at my company).  Lately, this also means that I&#x27;m usually quite a bit more familiar with our application than the senior engineer on my team.  This has led to a number of hilarious situations in which I am at my desk, IM&#x27;ing the senior engineer what he needs to say at meetings, as those meetings are happening.  I can&#x27;t attend these meetings, because they&#x27;re only for senior engineers!<p>Because I generally have no time to write code or do anything other than write e-mails and put out fires during the work week, I spend a large part of my weekends writing code for prototypes and projects, thinking about the designs of various parts of the company&#x27;s application, improving our documentation, writing code quality guides, and coming up with various process improvements (e.g. ways to improve our source control policies, ways that we can improve our interview process, etc).  When I show other people (engineers on other teams, management, etc) what I&#x27;ve worked on, I generally don&#x27;t get any response whatsoever.  This is problematic, because I need management to sign off on any changes that I make to our code-base or any of our processes, and without their sign-off, my work basically goes to waste.  It&#x27;s alright if none of my ideas get implemented -- they might be bad ideas (in hindsight, I know that some of them are!) -- but it would at least be nice to get some feedback, and I never get any.<p>To make matters worse, management doesn&#x27;t seem to be aware of any of this.  My manager has suggested that I try to take on more tasks at the next job-level up from mine, when by the company&#x27;s own guidelines, I&#x27;ve been doing the job of a senior engineer for some time now (though I probably haven&#x27;t been doing as well at it as an actual senior engineer would).  I will admit that I haven&#x27;t been doing an great job of making myself &quot;visible&quot; to management, but I think that I&#x27;ve been doing enough that they should have more awareness than they seem to have.<p>Other than that, I just can&#x27;t seem to connect with anyone at work.  I try to have conversations with other engineers about software (I&#x27;ve tried a wide variety of topics), and am generally greeted with head-nodding and a blank stare -- sometimes other engineers even make impolite comments about my interest in software.  I&#x27;ve tried to organize meetings where we can discuss computer science topics, but management, while supportive of the idea, has warned me that there might not be enough interest to warrant having such meetings.<p>The general M.O. here seems to be to do just enough work to shift responsibility to someone else, to be Agile (with a capital &quot;A&quot;) even though our organization is anything but, to schedule meetings (never try to solve a problem using automation -- meetings are the only way), and to basically maintain the status quo, even when doing so means making bad decisions that will cost the company big time in the future.  By the way, it&#x27;s not cool to think or converse in terms of abstractions -- only speak in terms of APIs, please (paraphrased advice that I&#x27;ve been given by management).<p>I&#x27;ve been trying to make the best of things: the attitude I&#x27;ve tried to have over the past year has been that if I can identify various things that we do wrong at work, and can come up with better ways to do them, then it&#x27;s almost as good as working somewhere where things actually get done in the right way.  Still, I&#x27;m unhappy.  For the first time in my life, I feel like I might be depressed.  I don&#x27;t like waking up for work in the morning, and on the weekend, all I can think about is how much the next week is going to suck.<p>It seems like this should be a really sweet job -- after all, you can do what is essentially bad work and still get paid, the environment is laid back, and people are friendly, for the most part.  But it&#x27;s actually really frustrating.  It feels like no matter how hard I try, I&#x27;ll never make any improvements to the company&#x27;s situation, because our organization in the company is structured in such a way that one single person (at my job-level, at least) can&#x27;t really affect any change by him&#x2F;herself.  Thus it feels like the only way to proceed is to knowingly do bad work.<p>Am I expecting too much?  Is this just how software engineering is?

We&#x27;re 11 months in and they haven&#x27;t really generated any tangible sales (3 or 4), and we feel they are not fulfilling their role enough to justify the huge cut of equity we discussed verbally.

We are currently very hesitant to sign away 55% of the company on oversold promises of them being able to generate sales.<p>The questions:\nWe are really not interested in screwing them over, we just want to make sure that the split is truly equitable. We were wondering if the HN community had any thoughts on:\n1. How much room do we have to negotiate better terms (we want to maintain the partnership, just for far less equity)\n2. Do they have strong legal grounds to sustain the original split based on the verbal discussion<p>P.S. We are based in London, UK<p>Thanks in advance for any help - let us know if you have any specifying questions.","time":1465328351,"title":"Ask HN: Post verbal discussion, unsure about signing shareholders agreement","type":"story"},{"by":"andrewfromx","descendants":10,"id":11857045,"kids":[11859418,11859768,11861866,11862172,11857065],"score":4,"text":"When a server goes down, or some other 911 business disaster happens, how about an app JUST for communication during that time.

It is terrible language but for sake of explanation crowd-funding lawsuits for equity.<p>Note:  Due to Bar Rules any funding would give funders zero control or influence over the case and&#x2F;or attorney-client relationship.","time":1465148138,"title":"Ask HN: Would you fund a lawsuit","type":"story"},{"by":"r4um","descendants":2,"id":11842120,"kids":[11844167,11844084],"score":3,"time":1465149094,"title":"[dns-operations] Quick DNS Report from Behind the Great Firewall of China","type":"story","url":"https://lists.dns-oarc.net/pipermail/dns-operations/2016-June/014962.html"},{"by":"id122015","descendants":2,"id":11841964,"kids":[11842331,11842822],"score":2,"text":"Because I&#x27;ve never been employed as a programmer, I dont understand how employers measure programmers worth.","time":1465147164,"title":"Ask HN: How much time does your employer allow you to spend on solving one bug?","type":"story"},{"by":"kristiandupont","descendants":2,"id":11841957,"kids":[11842545,11842153],"score":2,"time":1465147117,"title":"The 'Unofficial' ADHD Test for Adults","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iozAFIr3BEw"},{"by":"jacobr","descendants":38,"id":11841798,"kids":[11842526,11842004,11842560,11842241,11842640,11845194,11842944,11843471,11844016,11842019,11842482],"score":61,"time":1465145291,"title":"Mysterious Giant Sphere Unearthed in Forest Divides Opinion","type":"story","url":"http://themindcircle.com/mysterious-giant-sphere-unearthed-forest-divides-opinion/"},{"by":"ryanlm","descendants":49,"id":11841694,"kids":[11842552,11842354,11842194,11842558,11842527,11842625,11842548,11842626,11842177,11842792,11842819,11842569,11842263,11842636,11842647,11841925],"score":59,"time":1465144210,"title":"Richard Stallman's Personal Site","type":"story","url":"https://www.stallman.org/"},{"by":"walterbell","descendants":6,"id":11841687,"kids":[11842244,11842193,11841955,11842669],"score":9,"time":1465144082,"title":"Will This App Disrupt $160B Ad Industry by Replacing Ads with Positive Messages?","type":"story","url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/julesschroeder/2016/06/02/will-this-app-disrupt-the-160-billion-ad-industry-by-replacing-ads-with-positive-messages/#3a32a89b1f6d"},{"by":"temp","descendants":37,"id":11841563,"kids":[11841727,11841718,11841848,11841716,11841911,11841840,11841787,11841753,11841845,11841739],"score":92,"time":1465142311,"title":"Reddit quietly updates 16 day old post: you are now tracked even if logged out","type":"story","url":"https://voat.co/v/MeanwhileOnReddit/comments/1083516"},{"by":"jseliger","descendants":7,"id":11841544,"kids":[11844552,11843782,11843781,11850493],"score":33,"time":1465142084,"title":"Why Housing Is About to Eat the US Economy","type":"story","url":"http://csen.tumblr.com/post/145455151989/why-housing-is-about-to-eat-the-us-economy"},{"by":"hellofunk","descendants":6,"id":11841657,"kids":[11842362,11842358],"score":62,"time":1465143650,"title":"NSObject (1994)","type":"story","url":"http://www.nextop.de/NeXTstep_3.3_Developer_Documentation/Foundation/Classes/NSObject.htmld/index.html"},{"by":"Tx3","descendants":192,"id":11841502,"kids":[11842519,11842528,11842166,11842394,11842398,11843199,11842615,11842402,11842147,11843480,11842557,11842902,11844038,11844709,11844661,11922922,11842630,11843680,11842451,11844655,11842291,11845138,11842780,11843761,11915851,11922537,11842656,11843232,11922536,11842863,11842401,11842650,11844484],"score":283,"time":1465141302,"title":"I Was Wrong About TypeScript","type":"story","url":"https://www.triplet.fi/blog/i-was-wrong-about-typescript-here-is-why/"},{"by":"the_duck","descendants":21,"id":11841476,"kids":[11842109,11841960,11842049,11841993,11841994,11842657,11842666,11843319,11842003,11843618,11842399,11841586,11841832],"score":41,"time":1465140928,"title":"'Be Yourself' is terrible advice","type":"story","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/05/opinion/sunday/unless-youre-oprah-be-yourself-is-terrible-advice.html?action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=opinion-c-col-left-region&region=opinion-c-col-left-region&WT.nav=opinion-c-col-left-region"},{"by":"maccman","descendants":56,"id":11841604,"kids":[11841729,11841886,11841732,11841790,11842367,11843198,11841755,11842052,11842105,11841806,11841829],"score":142,"time":1465143086,"title":"Be warned, there's a nasty Google 2 factor auth attack going around","type":"story","url":"https://twitter.com/maccaw/status/739232334541524992"},{"by":"codegeek","descendants":1,"id":11841447,"kids":[11841469,11841452],"score":3,"text":"What kind of things should one check if using a wifi network at a co working space ?

I believe that if one can identify these core concepts and then get to master them, via drills and exercises, that will bring about proficiency.<p>I liking this to my knowledge of the Martial Arts and I am sure this is true of other skills that one acquires. So with the Martial Arts, you start with basics, that is Stances, which is your foundation, proper form, then you get into punches, strikes etc. and then you get to work on all these individually and in combination, regularly, so as to build muscle memory, this polishes your proficiency over time. You are also taught forms, what you will call in Karate a Kata, which will encompass the stances, strikes etc that you have been taught individually, but now as a pre-arranged sequence, which helps you to some extent understand the implementation of the basics &#x2F; techniques.<p>So in my mind, if this can be broken down and thought of and structured when it comes to mastering programming, I believe it will make the learning curve less steep.<p>Please I will appreciate your feedback.","time":1464785274,"title":"Ask HN: What Are Core Concepts, Language Neutral?","type":"story"},{"by":"robermiranda","descendants":111,"id":11813717,"kids":[11814155,11813946,11814924,11814013,11814115,11814847,11814524,11816797,11836266,11814214,11813883],"score":292,"time":1464783137,"title":"Drop jQuery as a dependency from Rails","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/25208"},{"by":"blueatlas","descendants":3,"id":11813786,"kids":[11814030,11813914],"score":5,"time":1464783928,"title":"A leak wounded LabMD.

Spending time today with my family, and thinking of how to structure this post to Hacker News, a site that I visit multiple times daily seemed like a great way to spend the day.<p>Recently, our team realized that we needed to open up the possibilities and think of topics that we don’t yet fully understand and explore certain subjects that are unknown (to each of us, at the current moment). Multiple team members are partnering up more and more lately to learn and work on building new things together, which has sped up the learning curve for everyone, and has also been very fun at the same time.<p>Naturally, I started browsing Google+Amazon for ideas, and then started thinking of the problem from the perspective that we have the opportunity to create something new. The something new is a network with new distribution channels that might not have existed before today.<p>I’m a huge believer in combinatorial innovation, by combining two technologies that did not previously exist together before to create something new. There’s that magical, unique moment that happens only once when you create something new, with the real joy in creation is watching an idea perpetuate over a long time horizon and allowing people to experience things and situations that they never believed that could&#x2F;would have happened to them before.<p>(1 of 5 - continued below)","time":1464622953,"title":"The Library","type":"story"},{"by":"squiggy22","descendants":38,"id":11801691,"kids":[11801901,11802362,11802305,11802226,11801808,11801830,11802473,11801838,11802445,11802346,11801971,11802986,11802140,11801851],"score":134,"time":1464621490,"title":"How I built a profitable bootstrapped side project","type":"story","url":"https://www.getdeckchair.com/blog/how-i-built-a-profitable-bootstrapped-side-project/"},{"by":"blisterpeanuts","dead":true,"id":11801575,"kids":[11801724,11801730,11801713,11801758,11801747,11801748],"score":16,"time":1464619818,"title":"France banning off-hours email","type":"story","url":"http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36249647"},{"by":"max0563","descendants":4,"id":11801539,"kids":[11801620,11801843,11803735],"score":7,"time":1464619222,"title":"Show HN: I created a platform that gives indie games a better chance at exposure","type":"story","url":"http://gamehunt.co"},{"by":"miraji","descendants":91,"id":11801438,"kids":[11801612,11801555,11801534,11801572,11803786,11802160,11801577,11802176,11796806,11801866,11804858,11801694,11801802,11802985,11802107,11802114,11802418,11802680,11801877,11801959],"score":199,"time":1464617710,"title":"Scientist Engineers Bacterium That Inhales CO2, Produces Energy","type":"story","url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2016/05/29/harvard-scientist-engineers-a-superbug-that-inhales-co2-produces-energy/"},{"by":"flippyhead","dead":true,"id":11801396,"kids":[11802462,11801435],"score":1,"time":1464617118,"title":"Dutch Firm Trains Eagles to Take Down High-Tech Prey: Drones","type":"story","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/29/world/europe/drones-eagles.html?ref=technology&_r=0"},{"by":"sathishmanohar","descendants":82,"id":11801390,"kids":[11801992,11803435,11802742,11802787,11802953,11802644,11801972,11801898,11803094,11803205,11804159,11803029,11802999,11803371,11806579,11801471,11802800,11802901,11803024,11803188,11802933,11802784,11801399],"score":71,"text":"I&#x27;m wondering what makes people give up on learning to code even when they know the value in it.

We also have analytic tools and web apps, written in Python, that are fetching data from Parse.<p>We like Parse because it does all the synchronization and authentication in the mobile apps for us, and that has been really useful to develop our MVP. However:<p>- it&#x27;s impossible to make any complex queries (you better download all the database locally if you want to do any advanced computation on the data). We are not that much into the NoSQL hype, and we really enjoy the power that the SQL language provides. We also like schema&#x27;s.<p>- Parse doesn&#x27;t have transactions.<p>- how Parse handle permissions does not satisfy us.<p>- using Parse from Python is not really easy.<p>So now, we thought of several architectures for our backend, but we are having a hard time to determine which one to choose:<p>1. using Google Firebase instead of Parse. We&#x27;ll keep our mobile apps as simple as today, but it does not solve most of the issues we currently have with Parse. Also, Firebase support for Python seems to be very poor.<p>2. create our own REST web-service for the mobile apps, backed by a PostgreSQL database. This solves all the problems we currently have, and it&#x27;ll make it easier for us to write the web apps (a simple ORM that queries the database). However, this requires a significant amount of work on the mobile apps on the authentication and synchronization logic, times two (one for iOS and one for Android).<p>3. same as (2.), but we try to share our business logic between the iOS and Android apps using C++.

My ride&#x27;s bumper fell out and it was smoking a lot, and I had hit the right side of my body pretty hard on the door and the left side of my face on the back of the front seat (I was sitting in the back on the right side). It was raining and I was shaking a lot and really didn&#x27;t want to stand on the street where there were a lot of drunk people yelling at us, so I grabbed another Uber and left the scene.<p>I did report the accident to Uber right away on the app, took photos and videos of it, and thought they were going to contact me. They have only responded on the app saying their insurance would contact me in 2-3 business days but it&#x27;s been a week and I haven&#x27;t heard from them. I got bruises, external and internal, as well as a minor concussion. It&#x27;s been hurting more but I currently don&#x27;t have an insurance (life of an early stage startup founder...) and haven&#x27;t gotten it checked yet.<p>What are the best next steps?<p>Thanks!","time":1464312829,"title":"Ask HN: Hit-and-run during an Uber ride","type":"story"},{"by":"juanplusjuan","descendants":2,"id":11783247,"kids":[11783445,11783666],"score":11,"time":1464312682,"title":"The Perils of Writing a Provocative Email at Yale","type":"story","url":"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/the-peril-of-writing-a-provocative-email-at-yale/484418/?single_page=true"},{"by":"cft","descendants":3,"id":11783203,"kids":[11783386,11784401],"score":14,"time":1464312110,"title":"Yahoo's Marissa Mayer tops the best paid female CEOs list with $36M","type":"story","url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3610711/Female-business-leaders-earn-average-male-competitors-second-year-row-Yahoo-s-Marissa-Meyer-topping-list-36-million.html"},{"by":"Geojim","descendants":26,"id":11783058,"kids":[11793799,11794491,11793809,11796101,11793828],"score":57,"time":1464310106,"title":"How Neanderthal DNA Helps Humanity","type":"story","url":"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20160526-neanderthal-denisovan-dna-modern-humans/"},{"by":"brahmwg","descendants":9,"id":11782744,"kids":[11783007,11783702,11784641,11785862],"score":72,"time":1464307005,"title":"Blogging cells tell their stories using CRISPR gene editing","type":"story","url":"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2090527-blogging-cells-tell-their-stories-using-crispr-gene-editing/?utm_source=NSNS&utm_medium=SOC&utm_campaign=hoot&cmpid=SOC%7CNSNS%7C2016-GLOBAL-hoot"},{"by":"justthat1guy","descendants":1,"id":11782833,"kids":[11783562,11783165],"score":3,"text":"One of the founders of the startup I work at threatened me today when I said: &quot;If you&#x27;re not going to pay me what I&#x27;m currently getting paid, I&#x27;ll probably quit.&quot; I was trying to be transparent about my feelings when saying this and they fired back with: &quot;I&#x27;ll sue you and take your shares back!&quot;.

And this could present issues in DD from investors but also IRS down the road. In a worse case scenario, options strike prices will have to be re-done with tax implications.<p>Anyone have similar feedback or thoughts on this?

I&#x27;ve been doing full-stack Rails web dev for about 3 years and find myself increasingly bumping up against the limitations of Ruby&#x2F;Rails. I won&#x27;t catalog all the issues since other people have done it far better than I can, but it comes down to the same hackneyed but true complaints around Rails: trends towards poor maintainability for large projects and bad performance.<p>So I&#x27;m looking for something new. I&#x27;ve done Java development on-and-off professionally for about 4 years. While I love the static typing and simplicity of Java, it&#x27;s too verbose. I always end up writing a lot of boilerplate code, and I absolutely hate Java projects&#x27; XML-centric configuration.<p>All this lead me to start playing around with Elixir in the last month since that seems to be the new hotness, but so far it&#x27;s really chafing for me. Simple things like loops and encapsulation seem incredibly complicated. Something as simple as setting a value in a two-dimensional array becomes:<p><pre><code>  new_row = array\n  |&gt; Enum.at(row)\n  |&gt; List.delete_at(column)\n  |&gt; List.insert_at(column, new_value)\n  \n  new_array = array\n  |&gt; List.delete_at(row)\n  |&gt; List.insert_at(row, new_row)\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m finding myself passing tons of variables into short methods because there aren&#x27;t any objects to hold ivars. No doubt some of these difficulties are due to the fact that I don&#x27;t have much FP experience, so I&#x27;m wondering if I should persevere or try something else.<p>On the other hand I&#x27;ve heard some really good things about Scala — that it offers Java&#x27;s benefits around type while being more concise and readable. I&#x27;ve also heard that Scala has some great capabilities around FP and concurrency.<p>TL;DR Should I learn Scala, Elixir or some other language I haven&#x27;t considered?","time":1463952539,"title":"Ask HN: Fed up with Ruby/Rails; what language should I learn?","type":"story"},{"by":"scrollaway","descendants":2,"id":11750450,"kids":[11750625,11750508],"score":3,"text":"I&#x27;ve been trying to find a good hosted general solution for my company&#x27;s server logs.

rolled out in my city and I made an order to see how it worked.  But this post isn&#x27;t about Amazon Prime Now, it&#x27;s about networks.  The person who delivered my groceries did so in what appeared to be their personal vehicle.  This really got me thinking.  There are many other types of delivery services where this is common.  Uber, Lyft, et. al. are hot topics of conversation here, but there&#x27;s many more.  When you take your car to the shop the shop orders parts that are delivered from local warehouses in traditional consumer vehicles, pizza delivery drivers, numerable local couriers, etc.<p>Each of these delivery systems are siloed from one another.  When the types of systems are similar enough you get silly&#x2F;inefficient practices like Uber&#x2F;Lyft drivers having two phones, one for each service.  What we really need is a meta-service.  One in which any arbitrary vehicle and any arbitrary driver can deliver any arbitrary cargo (human or otherwise).  You have a single phone app which offers you fares to deliver an Uber customer, a pizza, or an auto part simultaneously.  You pick the one you want.<p>This would completely change the world for these types of services.  It would open up multiple types of cargo to drivers who could then always choose to deliver the product which pays them the best.  Vendors could choose to pay at a rate commensurate with the urgency at which they need the cargo.  You get much more efficient use of time because a single driver could pick up multiple packages from multiple vendor warehouses and deliver them to multiple destinations in a single trip.  This would drive down the costs for everyone.<p>However, I don&#x27;t foresee the likes of Uber giving up their firm grasp on the driver&#x2F;vehicle.  At least not yet.  I suspect though, once actual human drivers are completely out of the picture these types of options may be more plausible.

There was also the promise of imminent funding to hire more dev&#x27;s to really polish off the product. Unfortunately we&#x27;re now a few months in and no cigar just yet. To make it worse all but myself, and the new <i>(hands on, but never seen)</i> investors, are going to be gone due to better offers elsewhere. It turns out that the management and guidance from the incubator has been not so great, and has been on the decline for a while.<p>However, the company (whats left of it) is finally about to sign on the illusive investment which could give it a chance to actually bring on new developers, and have runway to get things through till the end of the year.<p>I&#x27;m currently looking for something else, as at this point I&#x27;m surprised things haven&#x27;t just been shutdown. Though I&#x27;m not sure if I should:<p>* bail immediately,\n* wait till I have something new secured,\n* or, risk sticking around to make the most out of this new investment and using it as a growth&#x2F;learning opportunity.<p>Does anyone have any experience in this sort of situation or advice on what they would do?","time":1463700606,"title":"I'm about to be the last one on a sinking ship.

Now, I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with either one of the frameworks, so I&#x27;d like to ask your opinion on which one of them would be a better choice.<p>I&#x27;m currently considering to use a mixture of both, Django on server-side and Angular on client. Besides functionality, the webapp should be user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing, as well as responsive (very important).<p>Since we&#x27;re on the topic, I&#x27;m still unsure whether I&#x27;ll design the database from scratch and manually implement the shopping cart functionality or use an existing solution. Django seems to have some e-commerce plugins.

I&#x27;m thinking of including functionality to point the app at a server of your choice, so you have more control over your channels of communication (though I guess your ISP can still track meta-data and what-have-you)<p>- Initially, my plan is to only support in-person key exchanges (or whatever method of authentication is required).

Perhaps it could vibrate like a phone, etc.  I&#x27;m sure others here will have better ideas.<p>I&#x27;d love to own such a device.","time":1463597423,"title":"Startup Suggestion – Posture Monitor","type":"story"},{"by":"daddy_drank","descendants":109,"id":11724654,"kids":[11725471,11725391,11726155,11726916,11725026,11725192,11727556,11725532,11727901,11725822,11725269,11726434,11725193,11725563,11724704],"score":117,"time":1463597408,"title":"Fitbit Acquires Coin","type":"story","url":"http://www.engadget.com/2016/05/18/fitbit-buys-coin/"},{"by":"gordon_freeman","descendants":4,"id":11724646,"kids":[11724696,11724665],"score":11,"time":1463597338,"title":"Instant Apps for Android","type":"story","url":"http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/18/google-takes-a-new-approach-to-native-apps-with-instant-apps-for-android/"},{"by":"Nemant","descendants":204,"id":11724540,"kids":[11724614,11724854,11724760,11724896,11724901,11724666,11725249,11724683,11724700,11724619,11726015,11725238,11728121,11725289,11724601,11725593,11724679,11726879,11728704,11728274,11724951,11726321,11725699,11728215,11727691,11725899,11728003,11730112,11725863,11725448,11725130,11729341,11724867,11726261,11724659,11725158,11724888,11728867,11725943,11728848,11724773,11725721,11724738,11724712,11724958],"score":530,"time":1463596687,"title":"Firebase expands to become a unified app platform","type":"story","url":"https://firebase.googleblog.com/2016/05/firebase-expands-to-become-unified-app-platform.html"},{"by":"nickcobb","descendants":3,"id":11724472,"kids":[11724520,11726142,11726565],"score":41,"time":1463596298,"title":"CIA 'mistakenly' destroys copy of 6,700-page US torture report","type":"story","url":"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/cia-mistakenly-destroys-copy-of-6700-page-us-torture-report-feinstein-a7034096.html"},{"by":"T-A","descendants":108,"id":11724311,"kids":[11725113,11725918,11724817,11725307,11724761,11727359,11726578,11725142,11724645,11726500,11728715],"score":183,"time":1463595325,"title":"Daydream Is Google’s Android-Powered VR Platform","type":"story","url":"http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/18/11683536/google-daydream-virtual-reality-announced-android-n-io-2016"},{"by":"ascertain","descendants":45,"id":11724261,"kids":[11724992,11725056,11726290,11725460,11724891,11725623,11729383,11724928,11726558],"score":80,"time":1463595066,"title":"Karma-Duped: A Cautionary Tale About the Murky World of Venture Lending","type":"story","url":"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/greg-selkoe/karmaduped-a-cautionary-t_b_9860368.html"},{"by":"rissyrussell","descendants":2,"id":11724214,"kids":[11724620,11724341],"score":16,"time":1463594833,"title":"Women in tech are taking shorter lunch breaks than men","type":"story","url":"https://www.comparably.com/blog/how-long-do-you-take-for-lunch-breaks/"},{"by":"benevol","descendants":94,"id":11724010,"kids":[11725332,11725442,11725851,11725817,11725006,11726126,11727971,11725281,11725046],"score":114,"time":1463593780,"title":" Tor developer dodges FBI, leaves US","type":"story","url":"http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/17/technology/tor-developer-fbi/"},{"by":"alfredxing","descendants":16,"id":11724113,"kids":[11724133,11724131,11724326,11726494,11727738,11724288,11725007,11725847,11738911,11724327],"score":16,"time":1463594321,"title":"Help Name Android N","type":"story","url":"https://www.android.com/versions/name-n/"},{"by":"heyheyhey","descendants":8,"id":11723980,"kids":[11724096,11724134,11727876,11724227,11727643],"score":23,"time":1463593605,"title":"Allo, Google's new messaging app","type":"story","url":"http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/18/11699122/google-allo-messaging-app-announced-io-2016"},{"by":"gwintrob","descendants":8,"id":11723863,"kids":[11724356,11724737,11725889],"score":28,"time":1463593014,"title":"Scaling NSQ to 750B Messages","type":"story","url":"https://segment.com/blog/scaling-nsq/"},{"by":"billconan","descendants":7,"id":11723758,"kids":[11805575,11724150,11724157,11727269],"score":3,"text":"At work, I work on a huge legacy project, with millions lines of undocumented code.<p>I often have to poke around, change few lines and rely on unit tests to figure out issues.<p>sometimes, changing certain lines will cause issues, I have to revert back.

You can check out the website here:<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lbstanza.org<p>Here are three really cool things about Stanza:<p>1. It is <i>both</i> statically and dynamically typed. If you give no type annotations, Stanza behaves like a scripting language. The more type annotations you give, the more errors Stanza will catch upfront.<p>2. It has a <i>class-less</i> object system. We believe in both object oriented programming and functional programming, and designed Stanza&#x27;s object system to seamlessly incorporate both styles.<p>3. It has a really powerful coroutine system called targetable coroutines. It&#x27;s a <i>general</i> control flow construct that can be used for fine control over concurrency, and is useful for things like video games and webservers.<p>We&#x27;ve already been using Stanza internally for about two years now. Using Stanza, we&#x27;ve designed a hardware language called FIRRTL, designed a teaching language called Feeny for teaching a graduate course on virtual machines, wrote a tool for automatically generating circuit boards for robotics, and (as upstanding computer scientists) wrote the entire Stanza compiler in Stanza itself.<p>Now, Stanza is stable and mature enough for us to feel confident to share it with everyone. We hope you&#x27;ll check it out!<p><pre><code>   - The Stanza Team</code></pre>","time":1463520166,"title":"Stanza: A New Optionally-Typed General Purpose Language from UC Berkeley","type":"story"},{"by":"trusche","descendants":73,"id":11717326,"kids":[11718282,11718226,11718158,11718735,11718767,11718222,11718152,11718249,11718387,11718855,11718343],"score":95,"time":1463518482,"title":"Can Portland Avoid Repeating San Francisco’s Mistakes?","type":"story","url":"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/05/the-real-roots-of-portlands-housing-crisis/482988/?single_page=true"},{"by":"gk1","descendants":173,"id":11717269,"kids":[11718034,11719129,11719196,11717641,11717783,11717644,11717966,11717616,11718101,11718104,11719005,11718198,11718039,11719816,11717974,11719406,11718019,11720361,11719312,11718047,11719336,11720687,11719212,11717795,11718083,11720517,11719358,11719359],"score":109,"time":1463518026,"title":"Why Apple Music is So Bad When the iPhone is so Good","type":"story","url":"http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-apple-music-is-so-bad-when-the-iphone-is-so-good"},{"by":"tokenadult","descendants":19,"id":11717218,"kids":[11721472,11723074,11724237,11724281,11721191,11726231],"score":87,"time":1463517554,"title":"Is Gut Science Biased?","type":"story","url":"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gut-week-global-guts-western-bias/"},{"by":"wrongc0ntinent","descendants":13,"id":11717115,"kids":[11720719,11718795,11718270,11717630,11717257],"score":47,"time":1463516759,"title":"Europa's Ocean May Have an Earthlike Chemical Balance","type":"story","url":"http://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/europas-ocean-may-have-an-earthlike-chemical-balance"},{"by":"leksak","descendants":2,"id":11717111,"kids":[11717243,11717195],"score":3,"text":"I intend to dedicate some of my leisure time to increasing my\nproficiency with Rust.<p>However, I am stymied for ideas.

Whilst we can still run the VMs, even with tiny amounts of data flowing through it, it absolutely <i>crawls</i>.<p>We&#x27;ve tried testing remotely on a clone of the live setup, but the save-code-to-seeing-results latency&#x27;s a killer.<p>We&#x27;re thinking the solution is to get a nice big server with a few hundred gigs of RAM and a dozen processors or so, pop it in our office and offload the VMs onto that. Then we can share a disk with it over a hard wire, the latency will be nothing and it&#x27;ll run like a dream.<p>The problem is, we know how to think about servers in the AWS sense (like (this)[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ec2instances.info&#x2F;?cost=monthly]) but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be anyone selling servers like that, there are all these fragmented deals that say things like &quot;up to 512Gb RAM&quot; and talk about the types of processor, rather than their specs, and when you do find a good catalogue, it doesn&#x27;t have any prices on it!<p>Does anyone know how we can find a server that suits our needs at a decent price?

task).<p>* a good collection of performance and power saving optimized frontend libraries - (an &quot;awesome js performance and power saving&quot; github repo would be a good start).<p>If you are in the know of the secret sources, please tell us, thanks!<p>Also any hint on this issue is welcome, thank you very much and have a nice day!","time":1463052233,"title":"Ask HN: Resources for Front End JavaScript with Priority on Performance and Power Saving?","type":"story"},{"by":"maryvillavon","descendants":54,"id":11682607,"kids":[11682868,11683255,11682909,11684307,11686546,11682929,11683326,11683559,11683964,11683749,11683257,11683639],"score":67,"time":1463052021,"title":"Hashtags Instagram Won’t Let You Search","type":"story","url":"http://thedatapack.com/banned-instagram-hashtags-update/#more-171"},{"by":"mih","descendants":23,"id":11682540,"kids":[11682558,11697565,11692767],"score":49,"time":1463050391,"title":"WizNote – An Evernote alternative with an open source cross-platform client","type":"story","url":"http://www.wiznote.com"},{"by":"albertzeyer","descendants":14,"id":11682386,"kids":[11682520,11684755,11685899,11685492,11684319,11682856,11683002,11684321,11683177,11683014,11682857],"score":73,"time":1463047181,"title":"Open Knowledge Maps – A visual interface to the world's scientific knowledge","type":"story","url":"http://openknowledgemaps.org/"},{"by":"galfarragem","descendants":3,"id":11682351,"kids":[11682459,11682355],"score":2,"text":"A friend of mine was stolen recently (on his SKRILL account) and I wonder which is the safest browser (at least in theory) specially regarding money transactions.","time":1463046532,"title":"Ask HN: Which browser is the safest to use when making money transactions?","type":"story"},{"by":"mh-cx","descendants":53,"id":11682343,"kids":[11682695,11682473,11682609,11685976,11682583,11685345,11686213,11683018,11683472,11685740,11682478],"score":151,"time":1463046322,"title":"Konrad Zuse and the digital revolution he started 75 years ago","type":"story","url":"http://www.dw.com/en/konrad-zuse-and-the-digital-revolution-he-started-with-the-z3-computer-75-years-ago/a-19249238"},{"by":"abhi3","dead":true,"id":11682339,"kids":[11682484,11682479],"score":11,"time":1463046275,"title":"Brazil's Dilma Rousseff to face impeachment trial","type":"story","url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-36273916"},{"by":"bontoJR","descendants":5,"id":11682430,"kids":[11683235,11682880,11683244,11684232],"score":33,"time":1463047906,"title":"Six-hour working day 'boosts productivity and makes people happier'","type":"story","url":"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/six-hour-working-day-sweden-boosts-productivity-and-makes-people-happier-a7023741.html"},{"by":"l33tbro","descendants":5,"id":11682394,"kids":[11682456,11682407],"score":5,"text":"I have a lot of trouble answering when asked by an employer or recruiter &quot;are you able to build&#x2F;code&#x2F;create&#x2F;etc specific thing x?&quot;

I am the single point of failure in so many different streams. I feel like I am spinning 100 plates when all I want is a couple of things that I can master and take pride and responsibility for.<p>I feel the demands on me have gradually become unreasonable over the years.

I was given an impression that I will be doing automation work with internal virtualization environment, AWS, Jenkins, Puppet etc. In reality, the infrastructure is a mess and managers don&#x27;t have any idea about implementing DevOps. Management thinks supporting developer collaboration&#x2F;productivity tools like Gitlab&#x2F;Atlassian suite&#x2F;Slack is DevOps. Even these systems are handcrafted using common root password and no one seems to care.<p>* It takes 1-2 days to provision a new VM because VMs are provisioned by another IT department\n * No systems are under configuration management and there doesn&#x27;t seem any strong desire to do that in near future. &quot;It&#x27;s  one time change, let&#x27;s not automate&quot; seems to be the approach\n * Everyone knows and uses standard &#x27;root&#x27; password and custom passwords are written on wiki\n * Obviously no one knows how a system was configured and hence snapshots are preferred way of backing out any changes<p>It&#x27;s frustrating to me as previously I&#x27;ve worked with people having good DevOps mindset and we managed hundreds of production systems really well .  Here it&#x27;s all about emailing strangers and scheduling meetings to figure out stupid issues etc.<p>I need to pay my bills and this job is offering better pay and willing to sponsor my green card. But it&#x27;s frustrating..:( As my visa is expiring in a 15 months, I am not sure if it will be practical to switch my job now.<p>How do I convince managers or seniors to focus on automation and monitoring tools? They are willing to throw money at commercial solutions like SumoLogic, Splunk, NewRelic, VMware, Cisco UCS etc., but don&#x27;t understand the real problem that is within the organization. Senior managers and CEO doesn&#x27;t seem to care about these things as revenues are going great.<p>Sorry for the rant, but I wanted to vent out my frustration.","time":1462571578,"title":"Ask HN: New

I&#x27;ve been in my role for almost 2 years now and before then, I grew up writing software starting from the age of 7.  I started my first programming job when I was 16 and for nearly 20 years I was a sole contributing developer.  Just before my current role, I was a lead developer and although I had a few folks that I was managing, I was more of a sole contributor than a manager&#x2F;director&#x2F;etc.<p>Now that I&#x27;ve been in my role for 22 months I think I&#x27;m finally starting to get the hang of it.  There&#x27;s a lot that I&#x27;ve learned about being a good engineering VP and I finally feel like I&#x27;m getting comfortable in my role.  Having said that, I&#x27;m now at a point where I really feel the need to be part of a larger (but not too large) group of CTOs and engineering VPs.  It just dawned on me the other day that this is the very first job where my direct boss (who oversees the entire company) is completely non-technical.  If I just spent my entire evening removing a whole bunch of duplicated logic in the code base, I have to explain to him why that wasn&#x27;t a waste of time on my part. Or, if I just spent my weekend deleting a whole bunch of dead code, I have to explain to him why that was time well spent.  This is the first time in my career where I have a significant say in how 10+ folks in the company spend their time and decide what they work on.  I could go on and on with more &quot;this is the first time...&quot; comments, but you get the point.<p>I&#x27;m looking to talk to other CTOs &amp; engineering VPs who I can learn from &amp; even teach a few lessons I&#x27;ve learned.  I&#x27;m looking for people who are still coding &amp; love coding, but still have to devote most of their time at work on managing &amp; directing.<p>If you can point me in the right direction, I&#x27;d really appreciate it.

Compositr works by providing block combinators that can be used in declaring Flowcharts -- human-readable graphs that capture the processes of transforming raw data into scores.<p>These Flowcharts can then be submitted to a backend, which compiles them into runnable code. When raw data is submitted to the system, it fetches the flowchart, converts the abstract syntax tree into a Clojure S-expression, and then runs the expression as a function on the submitted data to produce a score.<p>Design competitions, like those that university engineering departments often host, can have widely varied and complicated scoring procedures. Our system allows administrators to have variety without sacrificing centralization of scorekeeping.  Our plan is to make the system a little more robust, so that it could be used to student groups to host actual competitions for kids!

At the time was at the time playing around with this idea of a content discover platform based a mockup for a new social network I found on dribbble. I started messing around with some code before I knew it I had come up with the prototype for what is now known as Grado. I fed it to a few friends and found that I got a decent response. People liked the idea that content on the platform was based on merit in a similar format to reddit rather than which of my friends &#x27;liked it&#x27; and as one friend put it ‘I had succeeded it getting rid of all the social noise’<p>So I continued to develop it while working as a freelance dev. I gave my self a deadline of 5 months and I was more or less broke I had a budget of only £500.<p>Long story short I did it in 4 months on less that £400 and launched it on the iOS AppStore. (it can be downloaded from here if your interested https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunes.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;grado-the-worlds-noticeboard&#x2F;id1090719110?ls=1&amp;mt=8)<p>I started this project as a bit of fun but I seem to be on to something, the app now has around 100 users without any promotion what so ever (I know thats tiny but it’s a start).

looking to transition out of startup nonsense and move into basic research. Obviously, it&#x27;s extremely competitive to get those positions, and pedigree is a requirement.<p>Rather than fight human nature (trust me, I&#x27;m smarter than most pedigreed people; it&#x27;s just exhausting and socially challenging to prove it) it seems like pedigree might be one variable that I can actually change: go back to grad school.<p>Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think I can justify the opportunity cost unless it&#x27;s one of the top few programs. It needs to be career-making to justify 4-6 years of effort plus opportunity cost.<p>Is this even possible, though? Honestly, I know how competitive it is, and while my undergraduate grades are fine and I could nail the GRE again, I doubt I can pass admissions.<p>I&#x27;m old. I&#x27;ve worked in software for 10 years, had Director-level positions, and make over $200k per year (even though I&#x27;m miserable) but industry experience isn&#x27;t valued in academia, and I haven&#x27;t written a line of LaTeX since the mid-2000s. When it comes to recent research experience (as in published papers, not corp. R&amp;D) I have zero. It seems like I&#x27;d need to hook up with someone in an AI lab and moonlight, <i>pro bono</i>, for that person for ~7 months in exchange for a game-changing recommendation. I have no idea if that&#x27;s feasible.<p>Also, how do people who go to grad school as adults line up the consulting work? Realistically, I need 400-500 hours per year (at ~150&#x2F;h). I&#x27;d still be taking a huge pay cut, but I can live on that. (I can&#x27;t live on a stipend alone. I have expensive health problems and live in the US.) I can easily afford 10 hours per week on consulting, in addition to graduate school. I just can&#x27;t afford wasting <i>more</i> time going out and getting the gigs. This is yet another reason why it&#x27;s essential that it be a top department.<p>Is what I&#x27;m discussing (getting into top CS department, getting enough consulting income to live reasonably) feasible, or am I just too old?","time":1462118631,"title":"Ask HN: Is getting into a top ~5 CS PhD program possible in mid-30s?","type":"story"},{"by":"afshinmeh","descendants":3,"id":11606523,"kids":[11643986,11607234],"score":5,"time":1462116404,"title":"Five Years of Show HN","type":"story","url":"http://antontarasenko.github.io/show-hn/"},{"by":"0xAX","descendants":33,"id":11606518,"kids":[11607253,11607259,11608634,11609351,11609172,11606819],"score":158,"time":1462116346,"title":"Inline assembly in Linux","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/0xAX/linux-insides/blob/master/Theory/asm.md"},{"by":"Perados","descendants":50,"id":11606602,"kids":[11607603,11607236,11608824,11608473,11608997,11607103,11607127,11606901,11606977,11607395],"score":86,"time":1462117630,"title":"Founders of Amazon and Microsoft funding little-known fusion energy companies","type":"story","url":"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160428-the-secretive-billionaire-backed-plans-to-harness-fusion"},{"by":"InternetDude","descendants":2,"id":11606473,"kids":[11607610,11606872],"score":2,"time":1462115739,"title":"Is ISIS actually related to Islam?","type":"story","url":"http://istanaislam.tumblr.com/post/143684802595/isis-didnt-originated-from-islam-debunked-once"},{"by":"jsnell","descendants":132,"id":11606469,"kids":[11606843,11606849,11607084,11607021,11607938,11606648,11609078,11607107,11607404,11607678,11606812,11607325,11607210,11609358],"score":155,"time":1462115641,"title":"10nm versus 7nm","type":"story","url":"http://semiengineering.com/10nm-versus-7nm/"},{"by":"esthermun","descendants":2,"id":11606463,"kids":[11606563,11606495],"score":2,"text":"Curious if people have stories they are willing to share.

To preface, I completely accept that browsing free websites and free content comes with the trade-off of tracking and advertising attempts. I&#x27;m not particularly tech savvy but I am careful about my internet habits because privacy is a concern for me.<p>Here is what happened: I was searching google for a stock photo. I clicked on one, which took me to a site called tradesy. I clicked within the tradesy website to look at the photo, but it was not what I wanted, so I clicked out. Moments later, I got an advertising email at my personal (yahoo) address from tradesy. Feeling thoroughly violated (and not in a good way), I discovered that the email was sent by Criteo, a &quot;retargeting&quot; company.<p>Somehow they got an email address that I have not used on any website, ever. I use my “spam” address for anything internet&#x2F;app. The only people that have my personal address are, well, people. I am 100% certain that I did not give Tradesy my personal email address. I even checked my browser&#x27;s auto-fill log and confirmed that no website has my personal email address saved. I have ad blockers and ghostery.<p>1) How did this Criteo company get my personal&#x2F;private email address?<p>2) How is this okay? I don&#x27;t mind some degree of advertising, but my comfort level is limited to not getting my name&#x2F;address&#x2F;phone number&#x2F;email or other highly personal information that I should have control over, effectively stolen and used to spam me.<p>3) How can I block this company and similar ones from my online life? I already don&#x27;t use Facebook&#x2F;other social media.<p>I truly want to understand this phenomenon and the current internet advertising&#x2F;privacy landscape, so if someone out there is able to clue me in, I would be very interested to learn. If you live in SF, I will even buy you coffee if you want to enlighten me in person!","time":1462036870,"title":"Ask HN: Question from a luddite re: cookies/web tracking, particularly by

is the best way to start building a mobile app when the API is not finalised?<p>My company makes native Android and iOS apps for our customers. A regrettably large percentage of the time, the customer will insist on 2 things:\n1) that they will take care of the API&#x2F;backend architecture and data for the app\n2) That we start development on the app BEFORE the API is done<p>I feel that #1 is quite reasonable, as the customer often has ingested their own user data somehow and wants to keep control of it. The problem comes with #2, which has caused no end of headaches for us.<p>Things we have tried:\n-Making our own quick’n dirty internal test servers that returns mock data that we guess is reasonably close in format to what will actually be provided by the actual API. Often, we guess wrong. A request that returns multiple objects is often broken up by the customer API into several requests, or vice versa. The end result is a LOT of refactoring, headaches and wasted time once the real API is available.<p>-Creating static views that just show mock data from the app internally, and not even messing with requests to an internal test server because this is bound to change (see above). The problem with this, of course, is that there is a lot of work to be done once the API is actually set up. Crunch and stress ensues, as the customer will often deliver the API close to the deadline.<p>So, my question is, what is the best practice for dealing with this kind of situation? Obviously, in an ideal world, we would simply not start work on a project until the customer has delivered a working test server, or at the least some API documentation.  I have been told by the sales guys that this is not a reasonable expectation, so a better technical solution is needed.","time":1461834531,"title":"Ask HN: What is the best way to build an app when the API is not finalised?","type":"story"},{"by":"51zero","descendants":30,"id":11587178,"kids":[11587579,11589537,11588871,11589428,11587392,11588965,11587445,11588375],"score":70,"time":1461830804,"title":"Google Reveals Its Cloud Computing Vision","type":"story","url":"http://www.51zero.com/blog/google-reveals-its-cloud-computing-vision"},{"by":"specialdragon","descendants":28,"id":11587170,"kids":[11587274,11587423,11587712,11587455,11589688,11589513,11588427],"score":43,"time":1461830668,"title":"Littergram: Cleaning Britain one picture at a time","type":"story","url":"http://www.littergram.co.uk/"},{"by":"muricula","descendants":11,"id":11587167,"kids":[11587702,11588620,11588309,11587683,11587494,11587841],"score":27,"time":1461830652,"title":"The Science of Cycology","type":"story","url":"https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/~rlawson/cycleweb.html"},{"by":"Osiris30","descendants":189,"id":11587260,"kids":[11587622,11587690,11587529,11589468,11589031,11589174,11590950,11589746,11594138,11591934,11587433,11588259,11591576,11592583,11592043,11588150,11590940,11589830,11588389,11589085,11588805,11588934,11588923],"score":135,"time":1461832227,"title":"How Cheap Can Electric Vehicles Get?","type":"story","url":"http://rameznaam.com/2016/04/12/how-cheap-can-electric-vehicles-get/"},{"by":"taapplyyc","descendants":15,"id":11587114,"kids":[11587138,11587135,11592273,11588785,11591825,11587140,11587814,11588216,11597034,11596216,11590582,11587850],"score":22,"text":"Throwaway account for this one..

Also with each experiment that is performed in the platform we’re hoping to build a database to map the state of the art.<p>We know this is idea will make a big impact in the way science is made.

A prescriber will begin with an educated guess for the most effective treatment for a given patient and the patient begins a period of medication evaluation to determine if if the right ratio of efficacy and side-effects are met; if not, the process is repeated.<p>Sometimes during this process, patients will only meet with prescribers for 30-minutes once a month providing a narrow window for observation.  Patients are given the difficult question of answering if they feel the medication &quot;is working&quot;. There are two main challenges to this evaluation:<p>1. In a study of 1, it is very difficult to control for other factors that effect mood or the effectiveness of the medication (e.g. sleep, diet, dosage timing, external life events)<p>2. The nature of these medications could change perception, so it is sometimes difficult for a patient to self-evaluate how their mood one day compared to the past. A patient may have one feeling about the effectiveness of their medication and another a week later when visiting their doctor.<p>I would like to build an app that acts as a friend during this difficult evaluation: regularly asking questions about sleep, diet, stress, mood, and general impressions of the medication. The patient and doctor could use the data from this app together to discuss a more complete picture of the patient&#x27;s recent mood than may be revealed in a discussion on any one particular day.<p>With the correct privacy controls in place, this app could provide a source of research data for studies to help discover why some medications work better for certain patients.<p>I would like this to be a tool to help people and create greater efficiency in this are of mental health and would like to make it available to all patients.

People do not want to deal with 15 different apps with 15 different interfaces just to achieve a few simple tasks (contact the business, buy from the business, view products&#x2F;services, etc)<p>Solution: What if we could have one app where you could find any business you want across any industry, and buy from them directly and seamlessly? What if your appointments and transactions were all in one easy place? What if we made this platform opened so that anyone could start their own ‘storefront’ (aka ‘app’) and sell their products&#x2F;services? What would that mean for people’s livelihoods and careers?

I doubt Google is having connection issues. Ninite seems to load in Firefox as well. I wonder what other websites act like that with IE 6.0? I don&#x27;t use SP3 because it loads slower and it is based on Vista a but and SP2 is more stable for me.","time":1461639289,"title":"Ask HN: Windows XP SP2 and IE 6.0 sites won't load?","type":"story"},{"by":"dbcooper","descendants":2,"id":11569011,"kids":[11569220,11569385],"score":6,"time":1461637499,"title":"The Tools of Campus Activists Are Being Turned Against Them","type":"story","url":"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/a-protest-against-the-protesters-at-uc-davis/479256/?single_page=true"},{"by":"konoufo","descendants":6,"id":11568744,"kids":[11569656,11569910,11568750],"score":4,"text":"\tOften teams&#x2F;organizations don’t even notice how they have a lot to win in working together because of lack of information about what others have been doing and where they are going.<p>Our solution ..<p>Teams currently function as autonomous systems. Through our medium, we want to connect them and enable them to exchange information, discuss on issues affecting them and collaborate on joint initiatives, thereby creating the “Internet of teams”. A new team in an organization should have easy access to relevant institutional knowledge. We wish to enable this cross-pollination of ideas and practices while enforcing various levels of privacy and streamline the process by which tasks are delegated among teams.<p>Execution ..<p>We interviewed 18 student organizations leaders across three campus (including MIT) as part of our market research and when our beta version is complete, we plan to offer them a free trial. First we’ll build a webapp where teams can lay out their vision over some time cycle (e.g a semester for student organizations), visually manage each team member’s tasks, monitor progress, and connect with other teams sharing similar goals.<p>Team … I’m working on this with a co-founder, Aboubacar Karim.

A lack of discipline leads to unhealthy and unproductive behaviour. At the same time the cost of healthcare is increasing for insurers.<p>Specifically: 95% of people we interviewed experience 3 pains when trying to change behaviour: \n1) wrong goals (to high, wrong motivation, don’t work with the rest of your routine); \n2) when it’s easier not to change they procrastinate; \n3) they start but then life get’s in the way (holiday, health issues, relationship trouble etc.) and don’t start again.<p>Today: many commit to another person, but they’re not always reliable. Most use to-do lists, calendars or reminders, but they’re easy to ignore. Many do it last minute or not at all, which creates bigger problems down the line. Most people have tried tracking apps, but the vast majority stop using them after a while.<p>Our users explicitly expressed the desire for more structure and routine in their day-to-day, rather than a desire to change one specific activity or habit.<p>Our Solution: a mobile life coach AI that helps you design a healthy, productive daily routine and makes you stick to it. It’s smart, fun, and it literally changes your life.<p>How it works: You tell us what your routine looks like today. We make you do baby steps in the form of levels that ease you into your ideal routine. We give advice on how to best achieve your goals. You commit a cash stake to each level. Complete daily milestones to level-up and win rewards; paid by users who don&#x27;t. Complete levels to keep your stake and play the lottery. Smartphone sensors keep everyone accountable. The AI gets smarter as you progress.<p>The big opportunity lies in 1) using the data to become really smart about how to change peoples behaviour, while 2) helping insurers save costs by incentivising users to integrate preventive measures in their routines.<p>Thoughts?","time":1461604731,"title":"Apply HN: Design a healthy and productive daily routine and stick to it","type":"story"},{"by":"adamnemecek","descendants":21,"id":11565720,"kids":[11567961,11567028,11570202,11567018,11567386,11568127,11566927,11567912,11566829],"score":188,"time":1461604757,"title":"RouterSploit – Router Exploitation Framework","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/reverse-shell/routersploit"},{"by":"kawera","descendants":72,"id":11565691,"kids":[11572604,11569271,11572298,11569047,11569209,11569765,11569780,11573093,11569003,11569789,11568906,11569067,11570334,11570302,11569043,11578084,11571683,11569080,11569952,11572341,11569079,11569337,11570173,11569397,11570909,11593599,11590992,11569082,11571662,11570795,11569510,11572754,11624408,11572311,11572512,11571418,11568965],"score":431,"time":1461604535,"title":"Uncanny Valley","type":"story","url":"https://nplusonemag.com/issue-25/on-the-fringe/uncanny-valley/"},{"by":"svirelka","descendants":3,"id":11565644,"kids":[11566088,11565650],"score":3,"text":"Hi there, we are going to update our LP.

While in San Fransisco you run into VC after VC, the decentralised nature of Europe makes fundraising much more of a remote process. In survey entrepreneurs often note, that the biggest problems are (i) that they don´t know where in the process they are, (ii) what their probabilities “odds” are, and (iii) what else the VC is working one. Especially for life science this is a problem, as founders always run risk of disclosing solutions to competitors.<p>Solution: BUSY.VC<p>A glassdoor for venture capital. Founders can rank VCs and business angels by (i) how quick they reply, (ii) how helpful their feedback was and (iii) if they would recommend these investors from their experience.<p>Business model: Pitch 50 VCs at once\nThe moment a startup decides to raise funding, it´s a difficult to create momentum and demand &#x2F; competition amongst investors for the opportunity. We help by sending every week a hand-picked newsletter with startup recommendations to a curated pool of investors (approximately 50 investors per startup). There are currently 6000 investors in Europe - founders reach with us all in less then three month (if even needed).<p>By our peer-review startups can be sure that their pitch, product and value proposition is good and delivered to matching investors - VCs will know that there is a market taking place.<p>For startups it´s free to judge VCs and to apply to pitch - but we don´t accept every startup. If we don´t think a pitch is ready yet, we provide direct feedback and help in building the pitch.<p>Investors pay for early access to startups.<p>Over-time busyvc sees this way as a “fair” knowledge-broker the early stage market much better and more efficient then every small VC.<p>(…)<p>* I thought about the idea for a while -

sometimes become depressed, or develop other serious mental conditions. The mental health establishment precisely diagnoses patients’ symptoms using the meaningless labels in the DSM-5. Most are then treated with FDA-approved drugs to hopefully lessen the problematic symptom. Patients whose condition does not allow for informed consent are evaluated, ‘prosecuted’, and forced to take whatever drugs the professionals think they should take.<p>BACKGROUND<p>My girlfriend ended up being subjected to court-ordered treatment when she became acutely psychotic after quitting methadone &amp; alcohol cold-turkey. Because the forced drugs treated effect instead of cause, she suffered through 6 months of ineffective and harmful treatments.<p>During her sixth hospitalization, I obtained the prescription drug and other substances that my research indicted would help. She was still very delusional when released from that facility. My treatment protocol has enabled her to rapidly recover to a ‘normal’ state, without the need for ongoing sedation. The interventions are non-addictive, cheap, and used as-needed to adequately control her anxiety and depression.<p>SOLUTION<p>Better mental health is obtained by addressing the chain of causation behind a person’s suffering.

I need to visit designernews.com, reddit.com to see what are the most voted articles about design. Then I should go to sidebar.io and check out the links there, and finally I also should visit medium.com to check what are the trending design articles today.<p>It may take an hour or more to do all this but only then can I be sure that I am truly up-to-date with design.<p>SOLUTION:<p>With Elfinite we want to significantly reduce the time we have to spend to stay up-to-date with the topics that matter to us.<p>Elfinite continually collects links from the most popular online content providers (i.e. YouTube, HN, NYT) and checks the number of shares (total number of likes + shares + comments) on fb.<p>Finally, it rates each link by applying our algorithm (publishing time + growth number + number of shares ).

To more powerfully manage knowledge, we can approach it more like an object model created on the fly by just using the system: what you know about a pen, say, is best expressed as numbers, relationships, and code (mass, owner, behavior ...); the human language words can change when the knowledge doesn&#x27;t.<p>2) Vision:  Be effective on an individual level, then link OneModel instances (find others&#x27; data, subscribe to changes, copy, link, etc), to build large and comprehensive systems in wiki-like ways (with the power of the network effect), but without the crippling human-language limitations.  Think wikipedia but all the data is effectively computable, and locally controllable.<p>3) Today: The AGPL prototype is like emacs org-mode in being keyboard- and desktop-oriented, and feeling like nested lists galore, but uses postgresql, allows having the same data linked into multiple places, is much easier to learn &amp; use than emacs, and has a  bigger long-term vision.  It&#x27;s (for me) the best personal organizer ever: very fast to navigate, and very flexible.  The web site is generated from its data.<p>4) Next steps: Community-building and funding.  I could really use feedback.  The current target audience might be note-takers who touch type, like speed (and don&#x27;t need mobile--<i>cough</i>), and need to be able to put the same information in more than one place in their notes.  And anyone who wants to help move the big picture forward.  Like, I hope to add anki-like features, and ways to attach code to classes of objects that were &quot;modeled&quot; on the fly as a side-effect of using the system (eg, so you can change the date on to-dos, in ways you specify, with simple code, or eventually run simulations, etc).<p>Much more info AND A WORKING DEMO or downloads to try, are at:\n<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;onemodel.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;onemodel.org</a>","time":1461338196,"title":"Apply HN: “atomic knowledge”: a new way to manage notes on everything","type":"story"},{"by":"janvdberg","descendants":55,"id":11549778,"kids":[11554315,11550452,11552782,11553898,11554250,11552804,11551767,11554755,11554193,11554140,11553271],"score":163,"time":1461338041,"title":"Scientists can now make lithium-ion batteries last a lifetime","type":"story","url":"http://www.computerworld.com/article/3060005/mobile-wireless/scientists-can-now-make-lithium-ion-batteries-last-a-lifetime.html"},{"by":"sharemywin","descendants":2,"id":11549659,"kids":[11549809,11549723],"score":2,"time":1461337099,"title":"Ask: Is there an \"Upwork\" for real things to be built?","type":"story"},{"by":"areski","descendants":5,"id":11549927,"kids":[11550441,11550500,11551034],"score":20,"time":1461339217,"title":"The Exceptional Beauty of Doom 3's Source Code (2013)","type":"story","url":"http://kotaku.com/5975610/the-exceptional-beauty-of-doom-3s-source-code"},{"by":"dankohn1","descendants":24,"id":11549635,"kids":[11549991,11550733,11550794,11550764,11552285,11551428],"score":122,"time":1461336917,"title":"These states let police take your stuff even if you haven't committed a crime","type":"story","url":"http://www.vox.com/2015/7/8/8909133/civil-forfeiture-states-map"},{"by":"Osiris30","descendants":6,"id":11549617,"kids":[11549771,11549913],"score":6,"time":1461336771,"title":"Kurzweil predicts solar industry growth of 2^6 in 12 years","type":"story","url":"http://electrek.co/2016/04/21/kurzweil-solar-industry-dominance/"},{"by":"clumsysmurf","dead":true,"id":11549600,"kids":[11549863,11549867,11549830,11549871],"score":17,"time":1461336650,"title":"Reddit: Hillary PAC Spends $1M to ‘Correct’ Commenters on Reddit and Facebook","type":"story","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4fv43z/hillary_pac_spends_1_million_to_correct/"},{"by":"vbezhenar","descendants":20,"id":11549496,"kids":[11550515,11551022,11551396,11550424,11550417,11550567,11551050,11550339,11550338],"score":46,"time":1461335866,"title":"Show HN: Shell utility to encrypt a file into a self-decrypting script","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/vbezhenar/shenc"},{"by":"knaik94","descendants":2,"id":11549460,"kids":[11550035,11550519],"score":9,"time":1461335465,"title":"Skype Drive by Download","type":"story","url":"http://knaik94.github.io/netsec/2016/04/22/Skype.html"},{"by":"vincent_s","descendants":63,"id":11549536,"kids":[11550213,11550728,11550202,11550209,11551320,11554843,11550403,11550749,11550808,11550197,11550890,11550408,11551370,11550334,11550353,11550558,11550731],"score":184,"time":1461336171,"title":"Fingerprints are Usernames, not Passwords (2013)","type":"story","url":"http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2013/10/fingerprints-are-user-names-not.html"},{"by":"AdmiralAsshat","descendants":29,"id":11549251,"kids":[11549381,11549493,11549330,11549349,11549873,11549465,11549804,11550084,11550317,11550871,11550265,11553248,11571905],"score":48,"time":1461333834,"title":"Ubuntu 16.04's new Snap format is a security risk","type":"story","url":"http://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-expert-matthew-garrett-ubuntu-16-04s-new-snap-format-is-a-security-risk/"},{"by":"shawndumas","descendants":54,"id":11549187,"kids":[11549929,11550704,11549989,11550350,11550258,11550596,11550910,11549939,11554867,11549953],"score":79,"time":1461333386,"title":"German automakers who once laughed off Elon Musk are now starting to worry","type":"story","url":"http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-0419-tesla-germany-20160419-story.html"},{"by":"hugs","descendants":51,"id":11549101,"kids":[11549656,11552498,11550063,11553926,11552257,11552245,11550820,11549244,11553266,11553001,11550812,11552940,11550161,11553203,11550470,11549327],"score":127,"time":1461332857,"title":"Checklistomania makes it easy to keep track of relative tasks","type":"story","url":"https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/04/21/checklistomania-makes-it-easy-to-keep-track-of-relative-tasks/"},{"by":"dgerhardt","descendants":14,"id":11549158,"kids":[11549729,11549781,11550908,11551377,11551356,11551313,11552844,11561555],"score":49,"time":1461333216,"title":"Show HN: Talk to website visitors right from Slack","type":"story","url":"http://blog.drift.com/drift-for-slack"},{"by":"brebla","descendants":2,"id":11548885,"kids":[11548936,11549402,11549216],"score":4,"text":"From time to time I have to assign complex passwords and give hard copies to users.

We&#x27;re also talking with a number of the biggest social media platforms about licensing Prime&#x27;s powerful algorithm.","time":1461330264,"title":"Apply HN: Prime finds your best time to post to social media","type":"story"},{"by":"rawkode","descendants":7,"id":11548780,"kids":[11549879,11549831,11550530,11550886,11549652],"score":82,"time":1461330326,"title":"Great video to help OO programmers begin to think functionally","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8I19uA-wGY&feature=youtu.be"},{"by":"raju","descendants":21,"id":11548689,"kids":[11550789,11549510,11549459,11548968,11548757,11549677,11548880,11549791,11549937],"score":112,"time":1461329432,"title":"UK intel agencies spy indiscriminately on millions of innocent folks","type":"story","url":"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/04/uk-secret-police-surveillance-bulk-personal-datasets/"},{"by":"Ovid","descendants":449,"id":11548816,"kids":[11549026,11549365,11549053,11549207,11549077,11550120,11549743,11549168,11550109,11549034,11549410,11548942,11548974,11553037,11549170,11549156,11549165,11549732,11549657,11549305,11551704,11549192,11552070,11548957,11549071,11549052,11551362,11549121,11550426,11549322,11549495,11549248,11551349,11549861,11550079,11550542,11550023,11553864,11552854,11550666,11552713,11550758,11553612,11549869,11549234,11550597,11549430,11548999,11553146,11550524,11553793,11570209,11549036,11553239,11548985,11550358,11553699,11553367,11549144,11551942,11553473,11552132,11555462,11553224,11552324,11552921,11549031,11552612,11549397,11549445,11550842,11549454,11549005],"score":857,"time":1461330675,"title":"The average size of Web pages is now the average size of a Doom install","type":"story","url":"https://mobiforge.com/research-analysis/the-web-is-doom"},{"by":"nailer","descendants":48,"id":11548658,"kids":[11548896,11548827,11549087,11548812,11549772,11549250,11548852,11548860,11549030,11549281,11548833,11548895,11549581,11548870,11548913,11548828,11549065,11548900],"score":21,"text":"I&#x27;m a node developer, I&#x27;ve been developing on Linux and then OS X for the last decade or so (in Python before node came along).<p>For various reasons - mainly around hardware - I&#x27;m interested in Windows.

been asked to either turn off our ad-blockers or sign up for a subscription when browsing various news sites. And it is a fair request, since those are currently the only sources of income for most publishers. The problem is that the ad industry has pushed the envelope so far that most people have had enough; intrusive ads that distract from the reading experience, tracks you across the web, and at worst infects you with malware, have become the industry norm. And most readers aren&#x27;t willing to commit to a subscription.<p>We believe it&#x27;s time to explore a different revenue model for online publishing, and seamless micropayments is the solution that is the most promising. The concept has been around for many years, but it&#x27;s only recently that the public has become truly comfortable with it through in-app purchases using their smartphones. There are mainly two factors driving the change, the first is its &quot;micro&quot; nature, the price is low enough to not warrant much deliberation. The second is its ease of use, the payment system is built into the phone&#x27;s OS, so most of the time you simply click &quot;Accept&quot; and then you&#x27;re done.<p>We want to let publishers offer their readers the same experience.<p>We&#x27;ve created a prototype at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scriber.io with an accompanying publication http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getexplorerr.com&#x2F;. We have yet to implement an actual payment gateway. Please have a look, trying it out from both a reader&#x27;s and publisher&#x27;s point of view.

The platform will be comprised of 2, 4 or 6 wheels versions with custom motor controllers.  The wheels are scooter hub motors( 36V 250 watts).  The two wheel platform will just be used as a proof of concept&#x2F;test platform for motor controller development.  The 4 and 6 wheel models use a rocker-boogie suspension.  Each motor will initially have a dedicated battery pack.  The motor controllers will be an open source 3 phase brushless controllers based on the arduino.   The controllers will communicate via USB to an arm board running linux and ROS(Nvidia X1). The goal is to provide customers with a clean navigation API so that customers can focus on building their application on the platform.  Addition functionality and hardware accessories can be added over time.<p>The business model would be similar to Makerbot’s initial kit model.  The basic kit will allow users to easily build the rover saving costs on labor.  Fully assembled and tested models will be available as well.  The company would also create applications itself e.g. fruit picking, lawn mowing, or package delivery<p>The goal the of fellowship would be to get the 2 wheeled proof of concept working with the motor controllers and off the shelf hub motors and a basic control framework e.g remote control with a phone.","time":1461250047,"title":"Apply HN: Open Rover – open outdoor robotics","type":"story"},{"by":"erbdex","descendants":2,"id":11542651,"kids":[11543234,11545576,11543035],"score":8,"time":1461250892,"title":"Magic Leap releases 2 minute video","type":"story","url":"https://www.facebook.com/magicleap/videos/993637637392422/"},{"by":"kelukelugames","descendants":167,"id":11542568,"kids":[11542850,11542840,11543007,11542919,11543477,11543183,11542828,11543418,11543113,11543002,11545031,11547150,11543282,11542931,11543230,11542888,11543483,11542909,11543276],"score":116,"time":1461250334,"title":"I Am Alex St. John’s Daughter, and He Is Wrong About Women in Tech","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@milistjohn/i-am-alex-st-john-s-daughter-and-he-is-wrong-about-women-in-tech-4728545e7c0e#.miz0024yn"},{"by":"arnauddri","descendants":95,"id":11542509,"kids":[11543143,11542747,11543434,11543051,11542745,11543082,11546010],"score":76,"time":1461249923,"title":"The Bitcoin hash rate has increased by 28.2% over the last month","type":"story","url":"https://kaiko.com/statistics/hash-rate"},{"by":"novaleaf","descendants":3,"id":11542054,"kids":[11542180,11542064],"score":6,"time":1461246455,"title":"Show HN: PhantomJsCloud, Headless Browser SaaS","type":"story","url":"https://PhantomJsCloud.com"},{"by":"epsn","descendants":5,"id":11542116,"kids":[11597016,11542411,11542429],"score":2,"text":"What we do\nAt EdXengine we are building an online competition platform where engineers can showcase their skill level on a particular skill set (software or area), (Mechanical, Manufacturing, Civil, Electrical and Industrial-initial target group)<p>How this works\nIf you are a Mechanical engineer concentrating on Computational Fluid Dynamics, there will be a challenge ladder for you which starts from basic level and increases in difficulty as you progress through each level.

It’s integrated with iMessage, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Whatsapp, Pinterest and also useful for creating captioned photos for slides, blog posts, memes (e.g. imgur) and small business ads.  My business model is to give the app away to consumers for free and license the technology to companies who would like to integrate the tech into their apps.<p>I have filed a fairly extensive patent application on it.

However, it has thrown into relief how miserable I am as a tech worker.<p>I never graduated college. It was simply unnecessary for my getting a job. At my current startup, I am surrounded by people interested in &quot;shiny&quot; new technologies or experiences rather than solving problems well and going home to enjoy those experiences. At first I thought my dysphoria was related to this culture fit, but I&#x27;m realizing the underlying problems are endemic: I think the tech industry is actively misanthropic. There is this implicit belief in progress, in particular that tech represents some inherent advancement for the human race. To some extent I agree; however, for every positive thing tech enables (e.g. space exploration), there are hundreds destroying people&#x27;s lives: think Uber rapes, Uber&#x27;s bait-and-switch driver policy (have a loan! Oh we&#x27;re paying you less next month, btw. Hey you got that loan payment?), industrial food production, global warming, resource exhaustion, increased work hours, increased mental illness, the illusion of enjoyment via Facebook, Twitter, blogs, etc; I enjoy some of the content, but most of it is wasting my time and making me miserable. I now consider smartphones as a whole to be a mistake and an epidemic of addiction as bad as any drug. Clearly, I do not belong in silicon valley; SF feels like Mordor if Sauron peddled crack mansions. <i>The future makes me physically panic.</i><p>However, voicing these concerns will get eye rolling at best. At worst, it is taboo and people start looking for exit signs. Were I to leave my job, I have nothing on my resume that could get me hired in another industry.

I had a CS student reach out wanting to use it for a class project. Others found it useful for prototyping feature flags without setting up a database. And some wanted to connect it to IFTTT&#x27;s maker channel. One person just wanted to know: &quot;How can I pay for this?&quot;<p>For some it was just a cool&#x2F;fun API to play around with. There are now open source client libraries written in Ruby, Python and Typescript.<p>One of the most requested features was the ability to create private booleans that only you can read&#x2F;write, and custom labels.<p>So I spent last week hacking on it and just launched those features yesterday. You can signup here to check it out: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;booleans.io&#x2F;signup<p>CONCEPT\nI look at booleans kind of like the ones and zeros of binary code. They&#x27;re the most fundamental building blocks that can be used to carry out more complex actions.<p>A simple true or false (on&#x2F;off, yes&#x2F;no) value could be used to trigger a variety of events - IoT, home automation, software builds or anything else imaginable.<p>Soon I&#x27;ll be rolling out webhooks, making it even easier to respond to events.<p>MONETIZATION\nThis service lends itself well to the freemium model. Paid subscribers could have a higher cap on booleans, a higher API rate limit and analytics&#x2F;data-vis tools.<p>ROADMAP\nEventually I think it would be cool if users could &quot;subscribe&quot; to other users&#x27; booleans in kind of a marketplace fashion. Companies could also publish booleans relevant to whatever industry they&#x27;re in, and consumers could then subscribe to get updates. I realize there&#x27;s some overlap with IFTTT but I think they can happily co-exist.<p>THE END\nThank you for all the great comments&#x2F;discussions from last week and I welcome any feedback or questions.<p>- Alan","time":1460907732,"title":"Apply HN: Booleans.io","type":"story"},{"by":"pron","descendants":32,"id":11514881,"kids":[11515139,11515314,11515211,11515215,11515209,11515619,11515863,11515070,11515124,11515163],"score":34,"time":1460907555,"title":"The New Man of 4chan","type":"story","url":"http://thebaffler.com/salvos/new-man-4chan-nagle"},{"by":"ingve","descendants":16,"id":11514818,"kids":[11516125,11515607],"score":81,"time":1460906689,"title":"X64 Deep Dive","type":"story","url":"http://www.codemachine.com/article_x64deepdive.html"},{"by":"readcodelearn","descendants":61,"id":11514753,"kids":[11515207,11515628,11517709,11515321,11515623,11515204,11515352,11515252,11515383,11515432,11515080,11515198,11516916,11516455,11517100,11515331],"score":197,"time":1460905864,"title":"When to post to Hacker News and how many points to make it to the front page","type":"story","url":"http://readcodelearn.com/notes/when-to-post-to-hn.html"},{"by":"ljim4a","descendants":2,"id":11514740,"kids":[11515141,11515283],"score":1,"text":"I&#x27;m in the beginning stages of a career, and wanted to get industry impressions of SRE (@Google) and similar roles (ie.

I&#x27;d read that licensed generic meds were being manufactured in India for around $1000 a treatment not per pill. Tim told me MonkMed wanted to help the millions without access to the medicines and wanted to do it properly with prescriptions, Dr support, legally (it&#x27;s legal to import 3 months worth of life-saving medicines into many countries for personal use) and good communication. They were on a mission. I decided to trust them. It was the right decision.\nThis is a long story and a learning curve for all involved, but it has a happy ending. MonkMed joined forces with another innovative maverick, a Dr from Australia called James Freeman of &#x27;Fix HepC&#x27; who was working along the same lines, this brave and brilliant pair have now helped thousands of patients world-wide access Indian generic forms of the life-saving medicines via the official Redemption Trials. Many are now cured and many more on treatment and getting cured. Parents, grand-parents, most baby-boomers I would guess average age 55 who have contributed to society and have been devastated to discover they have this virus usually many years after infection (it develops slowly).

There has been an explosion in complexity of ASP.NET Core&#x27;s internals, especially the tooling systems. Microsoft has approached this new version as an opportunity to solve technical issues in the old versions but they&#x27;ve done so from the inside-out, in a way that exposes the developers to a lot more complexity.<p>Here is a comment taken from a chat between the ASP.NET Core developers where they answered a question about a property in the project.json file:<p>Person 1: &quot;What does the &#x27;imports&#x27; do in the frameworks section of project.json&quot;?<p>Person 2: &quot;So that&#x27;s what I was referring to before. That&#x27;s the ability to say &#x27;Hey this project is compiling for net core app 1.0 which is the new TFM ah in the dot net CLI which represents an app that RUNS using the dot net core CLI. Basically you can type dotnet myapp and it will run uhm that TFM though no one has compiled for that TFM yet because you know it&#x27;s brand new so if you go to nuget and download JSON.NET there&#x27;s no TFM that matches dot net core app and the only TFM that dot net core app inherits from is the net standard TFM because we&#x27;re trying to replat everything on net standard so in order to get nuget packages to correctly install into your project when they don&#x27;t have assemblies or assets for that TFM you can tell the project system &#x27;Please also import assets from these other TFMs&#x27; and then you&#x27;re free to put in what ever TFM you want and we ill just blindly treat it as compatible. It may fail horribly when you try to compile or run uhm but obviously this is one of those back doors where you can say &#x27;Hey, I know that this DLL inside TFM foo inside this package will work the way I&#x27;m using it so please just resolve it correctly and let me run&#x27;.<p>Person 1: &quot;cool.&quot;<p>(continued in comments)","time":1460759422,"title":"Disillusionment with ASP.NET Core","type":"story"},{"by":"elwell","descendants":14,"id":11508049,"kids":[11508782,11508732,11509712,11545251],"score":99,"time":1460758909,"title":"DARPA-Funded Clojure – Probabalistic Modeling and Execution Learning","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/dollabs/pamela"},{"by":"karmacondon","descendants":129,"id":11509160,"kids":[11509530,11509767,11509511,11510764,11509578,11509537,11510607,11509764,11509982,11509486,11509483,11511785,11509736,11510638,11509674,11510534,11509752,11510633,11511326,11510866,11511428,11509673,11511345,11511769,11512148,11510549,11511783,11509510,11509532,11510038,11511691,11513298,11509996,11509868,11510972,11512450,11509694],"score":217,"time":1460777257,"title":"Sorry, You Can’t Speed Read","type":"story","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/opinion/sunday/sorry-you-cant-speed-read.html"},{"by":"max_","descendants":2,"id":11508006,"kids":[11508769,11509955],"score":6,"time":1460758353,"title":"What US Software Companies Should Understand","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@did_78238/what-us-software-companies-should-understand-about-the-rest-of-the-world-783e8dbca758#.fcmi8fdb1"},{"by":"gt565k","descendants":2,"id":11507940,"kids":[11507986,11508122],"score":2,"text":"I&#x27;ve been fascinated by this project<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ronja.twibright.com&#x2F;about.php<p>And was wondering if anyone knows of similar&#x2F;alternative projects.<p>This one seems to be limited to about 1.4km.

Returning a purchase isn’t so easy, because at the very least we have to deal with USPS and then wait upwards of several days for our refunds. On the other hand, offline shopping is very tiring and time consuming. The choices are limited and it’s difficult to compare prices.<p>Tryshop: You can order clothes online and try them on in a real fitting room. Of course, it’s completely free of charge. You can even order multiple sizes of the same items.<p>How: Behind the scenes, we work with brick-and-mortar stores and operate like Instacart. We collect the orders from local stores and deliver them to our fitting rooms or to your home. You can then try them on. This way, we can benefit from the best features of both online and offline shopping. In other words, all the stores in your city connected by one online shop with one fitting room. As for the fitting rooms, we can use the fitting rooms of local stores or we can open our own fitting rooms.<p>Demo: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.app.tryshop.co\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.app.tryshop.co</a> Built with Meteor, which I am a huge fan of. You will be automatically logged in to a demo account and can experience the checkout process. Please let me know if you encounter any problems.<p>About me: I am a physicist and a JS developer who had worked on a technicolor model for a few years until the Higgs boson was discovered.

This gap prevents us from having the connected experience we deserve, from knowing more about our vicinity and often forces us to make uninformed decisions.<p>Solution: A mobile application which creates a decentralized network using Bluetooth and WiFi and uses this network to power the AI assistant. The AI learns from your activities, preferences and routine and gives you suitable notifications when you need it. All your personal information and everything the AI learns is kept on your phone only. And if someone on the Grid makes a query that needs your data then it is properly anonymized first.<p>Extra feature: Just like any network, Grid also supports running applications over it. Anyone can make simple plugins for the network!<p>Status: The app can create a network and has been tested(It sometimes crashes on Android 5+ devices :p but me and my team are close to fixing that). The plugin framework is also complete and just the documentation is left. We are now focused on the AI part, and we believe we can have an alpha by the mid of may.<p>Background: We are a team of 6 and are practically in our final year of college.

What sets the ParaWing apart from normal approaches is that the wing design is based on a researched avenue to increase performance using specific characteristics. The basic idea of having a ‘tow vehicle’ like a pickup truck in which to mount a base is the platform by which testing of the flight unit can be done using progressively more realistic simulations.<p>Having the ParaWing tow-flight concept is a test-bed to prove that the wing design and math will work. What isn’t immediately clear is if the creation will enable adding powered flight. The short-term goal is to reach a prototype for wind-tunnel&#x2F;real-world testing, and the long-term goal is to get the unit functional in tow-flight and iterate power sources to be able to disconnect and aviate akin to Yves Rossy, aka “Jetman.”<p>At first I’m not exactly sure of the market potential – or liabilities. What I am sure about is that this idea offers a path to a future where personal flight is actually viable. It took a lot of effort and risk to get aviation where it is today, and I want to be on the forefront of what tomorrow might bring.<p>My background in aviation is something I’ve been around my entire life. I’ve studied technological advancements in hardware, software, and materials like composites with relentless passion. Once this idea came to me, I knew it’d be headline material. Now, I want to get selected in this process to bring it into reality. It’s 2016, and we should have jetpacks by now!<p>The following graphic from 2012 gets the spirit on paper as I originally conceived it: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;TalG2BL\"

They end up browsing through apps, blogs and online reviews. Existing services such as Yelp and Google Maps offer little guidance and users end up with information overload.<p>We started Sure to make this process easier. Interviewing our target users validated our key assumption: finding sustainable options should be as easy as finding the closest McDonalds. The market in Europe alone is 56.8M, and with more than 75% willing to pay more for sustainable goods, the need we’re meeting is both prominent and growing.<p>Solution: Sure is a Facebook Messenger chatbot for finding and buying sustainable products and services. Powered by human assisted AI and using data capture and machine learning, Sure provides personalised recommendations for sustainable consumption curated from a crowdsourced database.<p>Why YCF: In March, our MVP had a monthly growth rate of 64% and with F8 earlier this week, we’ve tripled our number of active users and received over 1,500 messages just in 1 day.
