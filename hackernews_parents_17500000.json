We realized that the bulk of our AWS bill was made of EC2 and Data transfer costs. So, leaving S3, Cloudfront and SES, we moved everything away from AWS. The costs have become less than half.<p>My question is: \n<i>Why is OVH not as popular as AWS, Google Cloud or Azure among startups when it is so much more cheaper?</i>.\nI am aware of the following drawbacks of OVH:<p><pre><code>  * No disk replication i.e unlike EBS or Google disk, if my disk fails, I am at the mercy of my backups (given no RAID) \n  * No private network for all the servers by default. Unlike AWS security groups or Google Cloud private networks (which are setup by default), I will have to pay for vRack to setup a private network and is more complicated.\n  * Decreased flexibility i.e I may not be able to spin up instances instantaneously or shut down instances to save costs in off peak times.\n</code></pre>\nThese maybe big factors for large corporations but I think that a startup which starts with a small monolith (or a handful of services) and is focused on eventual profitability may benefit from using services like OVH.<p><i>Am I missing something here?</i><p>Also, please let me know of any better and cheaper services out there than OVH.<p>Edit: I would add that we have moved to OVH dedicated servers not VPS.","time":1537114766,"title":"Ask HN: Why are cheaper hosting services like OVH not very popular?","type":"story"},{"by":"akudha","descendants":189,"id":17999659,"kids":[18000737,17999847,18000324,18001129,18001321,18000552,18000398,18001454,18000270,18000307,17999894,18000823,18000748,18000566,17999921,18000420,18000342,18001046,18000830,18000572,18001012,18000389,18000676,18000682,18003514,18001699,18001132,18003556,18001002,18000515,18002493,18002204,18001856,18000993,18001779,18000898,18003095,18005622,18002232,18001982,18000441,18000395,18000641,18003401,18001771,18000713,18000291,18000763,18000706,18000598,18000634,18006506,18001179,18000983,18001676,18000700,18002373,18003621,18002428,18000619,18003035,18004011,18000985,18003635,18003675,18008423,18000388,18003298,18002622,18004227,18000870,18002729,18000585,18003549,18002944,18008183,18004482,18000936,18000437,18001286,18001085,18005248,18001300,18003016,18003042,18006416,18001462,18000837,18002211,18001123,18021261,18001318,18002203,18004869,18003219,18002936,18004066,18001161,18005309,18012128,18001287,18001434,18002245,18002566,18001159,18004702,18002122,18001907,18022185,18005945,18004143,18000244,18000822,18002475],"score":770,"text":"Currently I am watching Daniel Shiffman (example : https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_p5IH0L63wo) and I really like his enthusiasm.

One of these is an AI start-up. The mission is important, but it isn’t something I would be interested in doing on my own, unlike my lab’s research (fun but worthless in the short-term). I’m very successful in my current job, have a lot of impact, etc. (big fish, small pond), but it is hard to achieve my goals without going to a higher ranked university. So, I’ve been considering leaving. The start-up opportunity would include a leadership role making new algorithms with the help of software developers.

Very rich folks are trying to convince me to join.<p>I love a lot of things about my current job (mentoring, working on the things I am super passionate about, shaping lives), and I hate a lot of things (always stressed&#x2F;busy, very low salary compared to industry, tons of distractions from research, writing grants that will probably be rejected and without them I can’t do my research, teaching required courses to students that don’t want to be there, politics, etc.). It would be hard to return to academia if I did this.  The salary is 4x what I make currently, but the cost of housing would go up by 3x. If I was to do this, what should I ask for in equity?

It pays quite well and seems like a great offer.<p>The problem is, I don&#x27;t really think I am a Senior. I would say that I am pretty solidly a mid-level Android app developer. I have about 2 years experience with app development (over a 4 year period, since I was also doing a lot of testing and had some parental leave in there. I was totally clear about this during the recruitment process).<p>From before that, I have about 2.5 years experience with some unrelated engineering (mostly matlab scripting, doing physics based modelling and simulations. While this is technically coding, it definitely did nothing to make me a good software engineer. I didn&#x27;t even know what version control was until I started doing apps.)<p>I am worried they are going to give me responsibilities I am not really qualified for. I don&#x27;t feel comfortable making big architecture decisions. I don&#x27;t feel comfortable choosing the right technology for a new project. I am good at component implementation and write pretty clean code. I work well with others.  On this cool matrix, http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sijinjoseph.com&#x2F;programmer-competency-matrix&#x2F; I would say I am somewhere between Level 1 and 2 for most things. The only one I am Level 3 is probably &quot;communication&quot;. I guess that liberal arts degree was good for something after all.<p>So, my question is, What do I do? Do I tell them, &quot;Hey, it&#x27;s cool you think I am a senior, but could you pay me a bit less and just call me a regular old software engineer?&quot; This seems like the most honest thing to do, but might also result in the offer being withdrawn. Can you &quot;fake it till you make it&quot; in a senior role?

And it seems to be not attractive to potential employers, because so far I was unable to get invited to any interview. I guess the long period of health issues&#x2F;unemployment is a big red flag.

[ ON-PREM Installable ] Let&#x27;s say you roll out first version( v1) of your product and you deploy it to 2 customer environments. Once you deploy you need to support like providing hotfixes, minor version upgrades. In the meantime, you continue to innovate and add new features &#x2F; remove a few features in the next major version(v2).

So now you have 2 major versions out there with customers using 2 different versions of your product. So the problem now becomes 2-fold. You need to have your team continuously support both the versions. Now the easier thing would be to discontinue the older version as soon as you have new version rolled out.

We build software for drones to inspect power lines and wind turbines automatically.<p>We are three drone enthusiasts. I met Nicolas in 2006 during our Aerospace Engineering studies at ISAE, in France. Small drones were still in their infancy and we eagerly enrolled in the brand-new student micro-drone club. Nicolas later met Geoffrey when working in India for a large aerospace company, while I was working on my PhD in Computer Science.<p>In 2015, we shared a feeling of disappointment that the vision people had for drones back in 2006 had not fully happened yet. For example, utility companies need to inspect millions of power line pylons. They still mostly perform inspections using helicopters or rope access technicians. They sometimes use drones for short distance inspections, but they could not scale it up to inspect all of their grid.<p>We decided to try to make drone inspections happen in the renewable energy industry.<p>In the beginning, we were super optimistic: we started by designing and patenting actual drone hardware configurations, building and testing drone prototypes. Then we realised that hardware is really hard! and worse, that new drones are not what this industry needs right now. Even with super high-performance drones, you still need a top-gun-level pilot to capture precise photos 8 hours a day from a drone flying high in the wind. And then you need to spend ages trying to find small anomalies on thousands of captured images.<p>So our approach became to automate most of the inspection process, using off-the-shelf DJI drones. We built two core technologies in the last 2 years to try to get there.<p>The first one is a mission planning and execution engine based on ideas developed during my PhD. It allows drones to fly on complex 3D trajectories that wrap tightly around structures, flying the drone sometimes less than 3m away from the objects to inspect. Most other drones companies fly high above the objects to inspect, so their apps show trajectories on 2D maps. Our app shows trajectories on 3D views because our trajectories are intricated closely around objects. As an example, we had to take into account the fact that wind turbine blades bend under their own weight. Here is an image of power grid inspection with our software: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;KRE1Oce\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;KRE1Oce</a><p>The second is a deep learning framework built on top of Tensorflow, PyTorch and Caffe2. It allows to detect 130 classes of defects on images: corrosion, broken equipment, and other safety hazards. The typical use case for drones today is photogrammetry, in order to create 3D models from captured images. This is not super useful for wind turbine and power line inspection, so we focus on our thing: finding defects directly on images, just like human operators do now. For several classes of common defects, our software has 98% recall and 80% precision. We run up to 18 different neural networks on some images in order to find defects on all kinds of equipment. Here is an image of our algorithm detecting an anomaly on a wind turbine: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;iGIxtAZ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;iGIxtAZ</a><p>These two technologies are linked to a GraphQL API and cloud platform. Our customers get to visualize inspections results on PDF reports and 3D interfaces online. Our UIs are made using React and React Native. Here is an image of an HTML report for distribution grid inspection: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;dkznc6o\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;dkznc6o</a><p>In the last 6 months we had successful pilot projects with utilities in 7 different countries, and some have even started to use our software in production mode now. This is exciting for us. But we still have a lot to learn, and we’d like to hear your feedback and ideas in this space!","time":1536689497,"title":"Launch HN: Sterblue (YC S18) – Software for drones to inspect power lines","type":"story"},{"by":"farseer","descendants":44,"id":17961792,"kids":[17963318,17964927,17963388,17962626,17963197,17962502,17961933,17964178,17964223,17965498,17962454],"score":55,"time":1536687926,"title":"Marshall Islands warned against adopting digital currency","type":"story","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45485685"},{"by":"clarkmoody","descendants":3,"id":17961801,"kids":[17961954,17961836,17961911],"score":1,"time":1536687995,"title":"What Would It Take to “Win” the Drug War?","type":"story","url":"https://mises.org/wire/what-would-it-take-win-drug-war"},{"by":"WoodenChair","descendants":24,"id":17961820,"kids":[17964390,17964365,17967467,17968578,17968805],"score":150,"time":1536688114,"title":"Project Python – Free Interactive Book That Introduces Python Programming and CS","type":"story","url":"http://projectpython.net/chapter00/"},{"by":"sethbannon","descendants":28,"id":17961736,"kids":[17961891,17962699,17961854,17962245,17962333,17962233,17962370,17961799,17961821,17963900,17962277,17961899],"score":59,"time":1536687434,"title":"There are now 141 bio and healthcare companies funded by YC","type":"story","url":"https://blog.ycombinator.com/there-are-now-141-bio-companies-funded-by-yc/"},{"by":"stablemap","descendants":24,"id":17961677,"kids":[17963481,17962664,17965356,17963567],"score":157,"time":1536687028,"title":"Ten years of V8","type":"story","url":"https://v8project.blogspot.com/2018/09/10-years.html"},{"by":"adrian_mrd","descendants":9,"id":17961649,"kids":[17962536,17966258,17962062],"score":18,"time":1536686777,"title":"U.S. $23 trillion will be lost if temperatures rise four degrees by 2100","type":"story","url":"https://phys.org/news/2018-08-trillion-lost-temperatures-degrees.html"},{"by":"ohjeez","descendants":4,"id":17961640,"kids":[17979322,17962756],"score":20,"time":1536686720,"title":"Good news: Remote work is more accepted.

Where do you see your industry going, and do you believe you&#x27;ve made a good long-term career choice?","time":1536377462,"title":"Ask HN: Pivot to embedded Linux, pentesting, or robotics?","type":"story"},{"by":"bane","descendants":44,"id":17939204,"kids":[17942882,17941139,17942098,17941163,17942846,17941946,17941494,17939801,17942141,17943141,17941373,17943039,17941307,17944064,17941870,17943789,17942331,17943065,17941569],"score":65,"time":1536376708,"title":"The Mellotron In Action [video]","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsEso9JagdQ"},{"by":"mjfern","descendants":2,"id":17939094,"kids":[17941809,17940180],"score":7,"time":1536374486,"title":"No. 1 utility in Apple's App Store steals browser history, sends to China","type":"story","url":"https://out.reddit.com/t3_9dxz4s?url=https%3A%2F%2F9to5mac.com%2F2018%2F09%2F07%2Fadware-doctor%2F&token=AQAAtUOTW3nW-2hm26Bw4UTvSnXYsBOAwn4BVgo57IYPSRhcCT4s&app_name=reddit.com"},{"by":"TheLastSamurai","descendants":6,"id":17939101,"kids":[17940196,17942589,17940484],"score":28,"time":1536374609,"title":"DD, DU and DF – The Three Linux Commands You Should Commit to Memory","type":"story","url":"https://techtudor.blogspot.com/2018/09/dd-du-df-three-linux-commands-you.html"},{"by":"MBCook","descendants":16,"id":17938903,"kids":[17939087,17938984,17938906,17946918],"score":34,"time":1536370733,"title":"Apple Just Permanently Banned Infowars' App from the App Store","type":"story","url":"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/apple-banned-alex-jones-infowars-app-store"},{"by":"adamnemecek","descendants":16,"id":17939192,"kids":[17944711,17943653,17944524],"score":57,"time":1536376405,"title":"Youth-apprenticeship program in Colorado mirrors a successful Swiss model","type":"story","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/09/apprenticeships-america/567640/?single_page=true"},{"by":"mercutio2","descendants":158,"id":17938885,"kids":[17943073,17943099,17943971,17943452,17943289,17944280,17943142,17943154,17942982,17945029,17943254,17944507,17943187,17943117,17943150],"score":107,"time":1536370445,"title":"Poaching Tesla","type":"story","url":"https://www.aboveavalon.com/notes/2018/9/6/poaching-tesla"},{"by":"jason_slack","dead":true,"id":17938776,"kids":[17938782,17938791,17938779],"score":2,"time":1536368227,"title":"Elon Musk filmed smoking weed","type":"story","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-smokes-weed-on-joe-rogan-experience-podcast-2018-9"},{"by":"DoreenMichele","descendants":41,"id":17938835,"kids":[17939298,17939347,17939220,17939372,17939246,17939734,17939266,17955541,17940074,17939250,17939303,17939322,17939294,17939296,17939282],"score":177,"time":1536369425,"title":"Terry Davis Confirmation: Man killed by train had tech following","type":"story","url":"http://www.thedalleschronicle.com/news/2018/sep/07/man-killed-train-had-tech-following/"},{"by":"gamechangr","descendants":2,"id":17938464,"kids":[17938894,17938844],"score":26,"time":1536363896,"title":"“we're f--ked”: there is only one antidote to silicon valley's ills - engineers","type":"story","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/there-is-only-one-antidote-to-silicon-valleys-ills-their-engineers"},{"by":"artur_makly","descendants":2,"id":17938608,"kids":[17938687,17950187],"score":1,"text":"Ok so i just had the pleasure watching the sci-fi movie Deep Impact (&#x27;98).

I can&#x27;t think when I would&#x27;ve entered this data into any form (or conceivably think of a scenario as to why I would..).<p>In May someone apparently brought a broken iPhone X into an Apple Store, and used the stolen data to replace it under the valid AppleCare plan.

I know its an app with a viable market, and has potential. However I have a high churn rate (install&#x2F;uninstall ratio) of about 70-80% that I know I could improve. Just to put into perspective I am getting an average of 150 installs&#x2F;day and about 115 uninstalls. So I gain about 20-30 users&#x2F;day and of those I am getting 3-5 free 3 day trial signups.<p>Currently my app has a couple of issues with a few crashes a day which I am working to resolve but I don&#x27;t think that is the culprit. My design is decent, it performs decently and its not too convoluted. I use google analytics to track events but they are more of a way to report how much activity my app gets rather than reports on how people feel about my app.<p>I have about 500 active users and about 1,300 accounts. I used mail chimp to retrieve feedback about two weeks ago when I had about 200 active users and 400 accounts and I received only a couple of responses from people saying they really liked it, with just a few minor suggestions but nothing really enlightening. Just today I used to the new search keyword feature in the play console that allows you to see by which terms your users found the app. I have two keywords which I am targeting and have a very nice 50% conversion rate but mostly all of my installs come from keywords that are not listed and get placed in the &quot;other&quot; category. So I am a bit lost since I feel like the app could be optimized right now as its still very new before I try scaling out and just churn through more potential customers.<p>I am looking for advice in general since I work alone but more specifically are there any tools&#x2F;methods that could aid me? I came across https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appsee.com&#x2F; which looks great to be able to see how users interact with my app but I was unable to get a response?

I&#x27;ve always had an interest in programming and growing up I occasionally created scripts for gaming projects using the Allegro Library in C. While I&#x27;ve so far have had a successful career, I&#x27;ve found myself intellectually unchallenged in my job and unwilling to keep trying to convince myself that I was passionate&#x2F;interested in my work. So, I decided I would try to pursue programming professionally and as a back-up, I could always go back to a similar role if for any reason it didn&#x27;t work as planned.<p>I enrolled in a web development boot camp since I figured that would help me become a stronger candidate (I didn&#x27;t complete my bachelors), but after completing the course, I couldn&#x27;t help but find myself far more interested in the case uses of C&#x2F;C++, such as game production, audio programming, computer graphics, desktop software, etc. more than back-end and front-end web development. The problem I see with that is - there are barely any Junior&#x2F;entry-level C++ roles. The few that I see require 2+ years of experience AND a degree from a top CS program. I&#x27;m considering enrolling in a C++ course at one of the largest university in my city, but I figured I would ask for some advice&#x2F;feedback from HN first.<p>Is it unrealistic for someone without a CS degree to get an entry-level C++ developer job without prior professional experience? Would it be best that I get experience as a front&#x2F;back-end developer first? I&#x27;m aware that a language is just a tool, it just so happens that the programming fields that uses C++ are much more interesting to me.<p>Thank you!<p>(side note: I live in one of the largest cities in the US, but I have also been keeping an eye out at other tech hubs.

Have I been an imposter all this time?<p>Any advice?","time":1535993553,"title":"Ask HN: Am I a fraud?","type":"story"},{"by":"dsr12","descendants":24,"id":17903377,"kids":[17903736,17903809,17903728,17903931,17904207,17903733,17904888,17903743,17903734,17903936,17905749,17903749],"score":55,"time":1535991375,"title":"Stop treating tech jerks like gods","type":"story","url":"https://nypost.com/2018/09/01/stop-treating-tech-jerks-like-gods/"},{"by":"nadavami","descendants":26,"id":17903253,"kids":[17904642,17904618,17904899,17905423,17904622],"score":81,"time":1535990221,"title":"Make plastic printed circuits with a standard laser cutter [video]","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z228xymQYho"},{"by":"migueldemoura","descendants":32,"id":17903149,"kids":[17904304,17904220,17904596,17904293,17904280],"score":62,"time":1535989305,"title":"A practical guide to securing macOS","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide"},{"by":"Rovanion","descendants":59,"id":17903081,"kids":[17903478,17904133,17903352,17903309,17903604,17904658,17903209,17903520,17904214,17906101,17903928],"score":247,"time":1535988661,"title":"Unexpected benefit with Ryzen – reducing power for build server","type":"story","url":"http://lists.dragonflybsd.org/pipermail/users/2018-September/357883.html"},{"by":"gacba","descendants":4,"id":17903028,"kids":[17903416,17903426,17903229,17903425],"score":29,"time":1535988233,"title":"Brazil museum fire: ‘incalculable’ loss as 200-year-old Rio institution gutted","type":"story","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/03/fire-engulfs-brazil-national-museum-rio"},{"by":"gbear605","descendants":25,"id":17902961,"kids":[17905665,17905828,17905942,17905907,17905568,17906502,17905741],"score":54,"time":1535987575,"title":"The acceptance of bad scientific practice to the benefit of productivity","type":"story","url":"http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2018/09/science-has-problem-and-we-must-talk.html"},{"by":"JdeH","descendants":5,"id":17902958,"kids":[17908451,17905522],"score":5,"time":1535987497,"title":"Show HN: Transcrypt 3.7 Python to JavaScript compiler: dataclasses, JS6 modules","type":"story","url":"http://www.transcrypt.org?date=y18m09d03"},{"by":"dhbradshaw","descendants":3,"id":17903036,"kids":[17904519,17904371,17911188],"score":2,"text":"Ideally, append-only.<p>Basically, what do you do if you want to pool a bunch of streams into a (potentially very large) log file?","time":1535988290,"title":"Ask HN: S3 but with append?","type":"story"},{"by":"whoishiring","descendants":69,"id":17902903,"kids":[17902909,17932384,17905400,17909202,17905235,17993457,17905569,17903232,17904490,17903067,17904063,17905772,17903293,17959041,17903297,17945038,17938786,17903495,17904397,17903371,17907731,17905059,17904481,17908018,17951493,17907322,17905263,17904231,17913781,17933452,17922711,17936586,17905244,17965044,17935674,17907338,17907211,17906954,17908704,17913198,17924955,17946050,17942079,17908717,17934026,17937903,18004168,17951816,17951336,17910480,17902940,17949152,17903017,17929791,17957106,17976258,17918507,17905903,17936899,17942698,17917343,17916472,17916972,17956213,17962173,17924189,17948128,17909940,17902904,17903144],"score":21,"text":"Share your information if you are looking for work.

The reason I am being upfront about this is due to years of experience. As a born skeptic, whenever I read something like: “this will definitely”…I become cynical. \nI have been a professional graphologist for over 40 years. I know what’s true and what is not.\nGraphotherapy may help. Why should I limit my business market by implying it may not help everyone? Because it’s the truth…this is not made for every individual. Besides the fact that many people do not understand how it works.\nExplanation: When someone changes their usual way of writing, let’s call this style ‘A,’ and now they write style ‘B…’ One thing is for sure…the writer must take note of the difference (and sometimes the slight difficulty of the task). Now let’s say writing ‘A’ is the way an introvert writes, which is the writer’s trait and this writer would like to be more of an extrovert, which is the way one would be writing style ‘B.’ The writer is now trained to write style ‘B. The trick of why this may work is that the writer is informed that writing ‘B’ is the writing of the extrovert. The new writing, after 10 minutes daily for 30 days, has made a great impression and the ‘aware’ person actually look for ways to become more extroverted. This therapy has worked among countless writers.

This is something I personally value but I wasn&#x27;t able to find much technical reviews about this chip that would prove its worth to me.<p>I don&#x27;t particularly care for the touch bar (I admit it may be useful, but in my opinion they should&#x27;ve only added it above the function keys and only if it didn&#x27;t mean a great bump in price) so, apart from the reason above I&#x27;d be open to choose another model.<p>What&#x27;s your opinion on the current MacBook Pro offering?<p>PS: I do have to say though that all their pro hardware seems to be very overpriced for their current offerings and even though I love their products I have to admit that if I really were in the market for a personal laptop, I&#x27;d have a very difficult time choosing myself between a Mac or a PC.","time":1535841323,"title":"Ask HN: Is the new MacBook Pro worth its value for a developer?","type":"story"},{"by":"vyrotek","dead":true,"id":17894224,"kids":[17894577,17895625,17894570,17894571,17894585,17894564,17894576],"score":54,"time":1535840872,"title":"Terry Davis of TempleOS has died","type":"story","url":"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100025903548224"},{"by":"lnguyen","descendants":5,"id":17894111,"kids":[17894652,17896761,17895148],"score":49,"time":1535839182,"title":"The Online Gig Economy’s ‘Race to the Bottom’","type":"story","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/fiverr-online-gig-economy/569083/?single_page=true"},{"by":"fagnerbrack","descendants":25,"id":17894099,"kids":[17902592,17902860],"score":135,"time":1535839078,"title":"Coherence Penalty for Humans","type":"story","url":"http://www.michaelnygard.com/blog/2018/01/coherence-penalty-for-humans/"},{"by":"Jiri_Komarek","descendants":6,"id":17894063,"kids":[17896207,17896061,17896793],"score":32,"time":1535838702,"title":"Free 3D terrain map tiles for Cesium JS","type":"story","url":"https://www.maptiler.com/blog/2018/08/free-terrain-tiles-for-cesium.html"},{"by":"pdog","descendants":125,"id":17894025,"kids":[17894373,17894385,17894505,17894347,17894383,17894426,17894364,17894497,17894417,17894469,17894390,17894381,17894392,17894443,17894437,17894380,17895313,17894362,17894676,17897052,17894472,17894402,17894354,17894440,17894488,17894624,17894341,17894490,17894420,17894359],"score":130,"time":1535838179,"title":"How to Retire in Your 30s with $1M in the Bank","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/01/style/fire-financial-independence-retire-early.html"},{"by":"ohjeez","descendants":6,"id":17893878,"kids":[17899079,17901460,17902123,17902918],"score":35,"time":1535836058,"title":"How parchment is made","type":"story","url":"https://www.lrb.co.uk/v40/n16/mary-wellesley/short-cuts"},{"by":"Deinos","descendants":74,"id":17893865,"kids":[17894685,17894779,17894665,17896385,17896614,17896264,17896120,17896123],"score":110,"time":1535835849,"title":"Carlo Rovelli on challenging our common-sense notion of time","type":"story","url":"http://nautil.us/blog/forget-everything-you-think-you-know-about-time"},{"by":"ccajas","descendants":5,"id":17893788,"kids":[17893863,17894762,17893965,17896399,17898087],"score":6,"text":"I&#x27;m going to lead with a particular example. Everyone probably understand the value of code testing, though I haven&#x27;t seen it in my personal experience, to see fellow developers at work writing their own tests. I&#x27;ve been with five companies and they all follow a QA-focused process.<p>What we typically do is mark an issue on our project tracker (Redbooth, for example) as something like &quot;send to QA&quot;, wait for the lead developer to push to the staging server, which can take a while because the lead dev is usually outsourced and living in a very different time zone. When he finally pushes the code, QA is able to test the new code to see if the issues have been fixed.<p>As the developer I&#x27;m not expected to write my own tests there. I don&#x27;t know what regression means (is that like linear regression?) and wouldn&#x27;t know which testing framework to use. However, more and more, I have been interviewing with companies that prefer automated testing and developers writing their own tests.<p>They might ask me what my experience with unit testing is, my mind draws a blank and simply say I have no experience with it. I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s a turn-off for them and now probably see me as a rogue who plays by his own rules, wreaking a tornado of havoc onto well-structured code. Anyways, I want don&#x27;t want things like a lack of automated testing experience to be an &quot;anti-selling point&quot; anymore. But the companies I worked at didn&#x27;t have a business case justifying why they should spend expensive developer resources that detracts from something that just works already.<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know X but I will have no problem learning it!!&quot; is also not the saving grace at an interview like some people think it does. There has been no instance of me saying I can pick up new knowledge quickly in an interview in which the company gave me an offer.

One may consider Openwrt with some other rootfs so there would be much packages.<p>I am curious about problems in doing such a thing -- certainly for larger open source organizations.<p>( KDE ships slimbook but that is just a new kid on the block -- Not an Idea that can affect the PC landscape.)","time":1535699055,"title":"Why can't open source giants / start ups affect Windows monopoly this way?","type":"story"},{"by":"webdva","descendants":10,"id":17883409,"kids":[17890425,17890003,17883421,17884072],"score":15,"time":1535697368,"title":"Show HN: Portable matrix multiplication library","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/webDva/matrixmul"},{"by":"DoreenMichele","descendants":3,"id":17883401,"kids":[17898303,17899216,17899219],"score":33,"time":1535697235,"title":"Lost in the Storm","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/30/magazine/hurricane-harvey-houston-floods-texas-emergency.html"},{"by":"starpilot","descendants":28,"id":17883332,"kids":[17893456,17894167,17893941,17892991,17892955,17893105,17893949,17894065],"score":68,"time":1535696216,"title":"South Korea scrambles to avoid going the way of Japan","type":"story","url":"https://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/south-korea-scrambles-to-avoid-going-the-way-of-japan/88907"},{"by":"qubitcoder","descendants":114,"id":17883319,"kids":[17884307,17884492,17883946,17885216,17883750,17885192,17885398,17884068,17889382,17884990,17885505,17884886,17885431],"score":119,"time":1535696082,"title":"Silicon Valley is changing, and its lead over other tech hubs narrowing","type":"story","url":"https://www.economist.com/briefing/2018/09/01/silicon-valley-is-changing-and-its-lead-over-other-tech-hubs-narrowing"},{"by":"pietroglyph","descendants":4,"id":17883301,"kids":[17890523,17890754,17883347,17890611],"score":8,"time":1535695764,"title":"Sounds from Scientific, Meteorological, Commercial Satellites 1967-1971 (2013)","type":"story","url":"http://www.dd1us.de/spacesounds%204c.html"},{"by":"FrankyHollywood","descendants":61,"id":17883289,"kids":[17883571,17883591,17883713,17883583,17883764,17883952,17883600,17883628,17890749,17883657,17883609,17885556,17885430,17883595,17883586,17883577,17883703,17883553,17883652,17883663,17883704,17884505],"score":66,"time":1535695395,"title":"An entrepreneur says 32-hour weeks ‘killed work ethic’ at his startup","type":"story","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/productivity-tips-four-day-workweek-2018-8"},{"by":"omeid2","descendants":26,"id":17883269,"kids":[17889723,17889759,17889665,17892152,17890820],"score":124,"time":1535695069,"title":"Security Analysis of WireGuard [pdf]","type":"story","url":"https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.857/2018/project/He-Xu-Xu-WireGuard.pdf"},{"by":"kgwgk","descendants":28,"id":17883252,"kids":[17883625,17890234,17883861,17883729,17887276,17883951],"score":21,"time":1535694664,"title":"BlackRock voted for proposal to replace Tesla’s Musk with independent chairman","type":"story","url":"https://reuters.com/article/BigStory12/idUSKCN1LG01R"},{"by":"zdw","descendants":79,"id":17883236,"kids":[17890815,17890456,17890537,17890957,17893607,17891218,17890467,17890498,17890920,17890469,17890892,17890606,17896329,17890912,17890817,17893659,17884278,17890673,17891588,17890897,17891062,17893352,17890949],"score":97,"time":1535694463,"title":"I've mostly given up on making Ubuntu bug reports","type":"story","url":"https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/UbuntuBugReportsUseless"},{"by":"chmaynard","descendants":10,"id":17883187,"kids":[17885449,17885276,17885189,17885296,17885050,17886678],"score":60,"time":1535693457,"title":"Drawing Spirograph curves in Python","type":"story","url":"https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2018/08/30/drawing-spirograph-curves-in-python/"},{"by":"muzani","descendants":27,"id":17883165,"kids":[17892543,17883724,17885224,17887375,17893079,17887460,17888689,17889181,17887663,17886534,17887271,17886661,17884849,17883604,17888896,17900160,17889394,17883216,17885593,17883173],"score":26,"time":1535693151,"title":"Ask HN: What motivates you?","type":"story"},{"by":"ngaut","descendants":52,"id":17883143,"kids":[17884032,17889625,17893264,17892920,17894009,17884824,17896677],"score":59,"time":1535692823,"title":"The pain that minimal version selection solves","type":"story","url":"https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/the-pain-that-minimal-version-selection-solves/"},{"by":"lermontov","descendants":14,"id":17883069,"kids":[17884039,17884688,17883561,17887573,17886524],"score":123,"time":1535691716,"title":"On the Kidnapped African Boy Who Became a German Philosopher","type":"story","url":"https://lithub.com/on-the-kidnapped-african-boy-who-became-a-german-philosopher/"},{"by":"enjayz","dead":true,"id":17882993,"kids":[17883003,17883036,17883034,17883002,17883009,17883077,17883016,17883013],"score":11,"text":"I can&#x27;t access Github yet https:&#x2F;&#x2F;status.github.com&#x2F;

Your choice also impacts what buttons, form elements etc look like. Also, don&#x27;t get me started on things like jQuery dependencies. Mixing different elements from these frameworks really doesn’t work because your layout will be ruined. Why should wanting to use the bootstrap grid system also automatically decide what danger color a button has in your application? In the end, you spend a lot of time customizing these frameworks.<p>In my opinion what you really need is a grid system for easy responsive spacing, and then on top, you should be able to download elements in plain CSS code (or SASS, LESS, Stylus, whatever floats your boat) to not re-invent the wheel on every element. Also, there should be zero dependencies. It could be a community where people upload there programmed CSS elements and other people can download their code and upvote etc. Is there such a repo&#x2F;UI search engine&#x2F;product available that anyone knows of?

Now I&#x27;m trying to do small projects to apply what I&#x27;m learning, such as manipulating somewhat complex Excel files with Openpyxl.<p>I have a short, mid and long term plan in mind. I&#x27;m aiming to nail down the fundamentals of programming with Python and JS first. Then get hired at a junior position when I permanently move to Australia with my wife next year, and develop my skills as I gain experience in the field. In the long term, I want to write my own software, but that seems far away from now.<p>I have the motivation to learn, but struggle to convince myself if I&#x27;m taking the step in the right direction.

I work for will soon go through a major restructuring. At the moment the company has a &#x2F;very&#x2F; flat, start-up like structure (3 levels: 1 CEO -&gt; 2 Managers -&gt; ~100 employees). There are also roughly 10 team leads in charge of service lines&#x2F;products, but that are not involved with the business side of things at all (e.g. budgeting, leave approval etc.).<p>The reorg&#x27;s purpose is to introduce more structure and delegate responsibility (I guess all startups go through this?). Effectively the plan is to elevate the 10 team leads to managers of the various service lines and products they lead now, including some of the business responsibility.<p>I am one of the team leads, and also one of the most senior developers on staff. There is a big strategy session being planned to discuss and implement the reorg. The meeting will be politically laden (some guys manage 3 people, some as many as 20, with varying years of experience).<p>So I have two questions:\n1) In general, what is your advice for handling the restructuring? Any experience, advice or mistakes, pitfalls or caveats you can recall I should avoid&#x2F;lookout for? Anything I should specifically ask for, or push for?<p>2) There is a lot of unrest amongst the team leads (hence, politics) with some being way more senior (~10 years exp) and managing larger teams who will now be promoted along with&#x2F;treated the same as mid-level guys (~2-3 years exp).

The thing is, they were still riding on the goodwill they had built up thus far pre-paypal purchase.<p>Paypal is a total nightmare for some people (especially if you plan on growing fast), so the fact that they were recently purchased by them, should have been a red flag, but customers and reviews still seemed positive.<p>One of the selling points with Braintree was always that once you are underwritten, they are going to work and grow with you. Unlike Paypal, who will arbitrarily freeze your funds at the most inopportune moment.<p>Apparently, Paypal has now applied this same policy at Braintree. One of the features we offer our customers is allowing them to sell event tickets through our software. They can use their own merchant account, but we encourage them to use our in house system (braintree marketplace) because it is usually faster and easier.<p>And so it worked fine for 3 years, slowly growing, processing more and more payments through more and more sub-merchants. Hundreds of thousands of dollars. Then they just decided to shut down 2 of our newest customers and hold 100% of their funds ransom for 180 days. More than $50k for a single customer which is a terrible burden. Reasons given was that we had a sudden increase in marketplace sales from this new customer and they don&#x27;t want the exposure (even though we processed even more than this from a single sub-merchant last year in a short period of time).<p>So just wanted to put it out there that Braintree is now up to the old tricks of Paypal. Lull you in to a false sense of security, then lock up your funds suddenly for whatever reason with no recourse.<p>If you currently use Braintree, be careful, even with a good growth history on file with them, they are no longer startup friendly as they can&#x27;t seem to handle spikes in activity or at least have no desire to do so.","time":1535407372,"title":"Tell HN: Braintree is no longer startup-friendly","type":"story"},{"by":"DesHacker","descendants":51,"id":17854983,"kids":[17860204,17856797,17858048,17856817,17869188,17858114,17862264,17868093,17862977,17859019,17856694,17857636,17856619,17859786,17862322,17857044,17861573,17857382],"score":68,"text":"Life Hacks is for using best practices in life.<p>I love this one from Reddit:<p>Staying at a hotel?

seen people speculate if they&#x27;ve been pigeonholed in their career, in terms of being stuck with certain technlogy stacks, or tools, or a type of industry. I wonder about something else, if you can get pigeonholed to a limited set of company sizes and cultures.<p>I feel like I&#x27;m pigeonholed with only being able to be hired by very small companies. Fewer than 20 employees small. No fortune 500&#x27;s, not even any full-time benefits or 401(k). They&#x27;re very unstable too. I usually lose my job before I could get another one lined up. I had roughly $8000 in my bank account when I graduated and today, ten years later I have only about $400.<p>I want out of companies that constantly make me walk a tight rope of self-care. I want to ask am I pigeonholed? Because I cast a wide net with job applications, going to larger companies. Even some major ones like Amazon, Cloudflare and Coinbase have phone interviewed me.

hacker community. I am at the crossroads of my career. I started my Comp Sci grad career in software development for a Unix &#x2F; networking consultancy until where I learnt networking and software development ‘in the trenches’ with Perl and C. Later I moved into enterprise systems doing Java EE (J2EE) and .Net. \nAfter completing my MBA I started a generalist business consulting career where I have spent the last six years with a large global consulting firm. I have done a ton of work in financial services where my software background has enabled me to run miles around other consultants because of my ability to juggle numbers at scale. I am now about three-four years to partner in the firm and they have just reconfirmed their unequivocal backing to get me there. $ is good but work hours are long and often involves a lot of travel.\nI miss working in tech and was wondering if anyone else has done the same jump back into the tech industry from a generalist consulting role? I miss having fellow geeks as my peers, I miss tinkering with technical problems and the pace of change. However I also know I am too ‘senior’ for going back into a developer role. Becoming some sort of architect would be ok, but the 9-5pm cooperate environment hours gives me the shivers. I still want to be able to feel the ‘rush’ of business development. So perhaps a start up tech role might be more appropriate.\nSeniority or not, I can still be hands on and love cutting code and debugging tech problems. \nAny ideas or suggestions on possible career moves?\nFYI - I am Sydney based and also looking for international opportunities into Singapore, Hong Kong and other major cities.","time":1535263196,"title":"Ask HN: Moving back into tech industry from consulting","type":"story"},{"by":"anonymous5133","descendants":15,"id":17844483,"kids":[17848598,17846069,17845077,17847073,17846073,17846202,17844683,17845593,17846359],"score":6,"text":"What does everyone think the next big innovation that will be widely adopted be?

Most jobs are bordering on CRUD, and those that need some kind of thinking can be done by someone who has a &#x27;lowly&#x27; masters degree.<p>I see this trend happening for three reasons:<p>1) To reduce competition in job applications; employers are inundated with thousands of resumes for one job.<p>2) Most employers are copying FAANG, pretending that their business problems require PhDs to solve them.<p>3) We have lost our understanding of what having a PhD means, i.e. for a college student who wants to decide between two paths, industry or academics, there is no difference anymore. That seems like a very dangerous trend to me because 1) we&#x27;re wasting workers who could be productive and have no intention of being academics or teachers on PhDs, and 2) we&#x27;re wasting PhDs on people who have no intention of staying in academics, research or teaching. Not saying that PhDs have a limited supply, but PhD programs certainly have limited slots.<p>Industry cannot be like academia because most employers do not have the time or resources to indulge years and years on research, and making sure that the problems that solved are truly sound, and not just sound enough to ship it. This kind of lazy academics in industry almost seems damaging and counterproductive to any field it touches.<p>Maybe I am wrong about this whole deal, and so I ask.","time":1535213284,"title":"Ask HN: Is there really a need for this, or are we drinking the wrong kool-aid","type":"story"},{"by":"octosphere","descendants":7,"id":17841356,"kids":[17841795,17845314,17843066,17841863,17850173,17842049,17844702],"score":21,"time":1535213505,"title":"Show HN: Online Regex Tester for PHP, PCRE, Python, Golang and JavaScript","type":"story","url":"https://regex101.com/"},{"by":"kiyanwang","descendants":31,"id":17841300,"kids":[17841985,17841841,17841676,17841533,17841335,17841717,17842606,17841693,17843045,17841718,17841678,17841785,17841732,17841708],"score":48,"time":1535212624,"title":"Anyway, stop recommending bazookas to kill flies in programming","type":"story","url":"https://itnext.io/anyway-stop-recommending-bazookas-to-kill-flies-in-programming-65f13439be3d"},{"by":"rbanffy","descendants":17,"id":17841110,"kids":[17842115,17841428,17842352,17842075],"score":46,"time":1535210163,"title":"Don’t want Google tracking you?

have recently joined a small startup with a fairly small engineering team. Most of the company is non-engineers, and the engineering team is responsible for the internal tools and external tools.<p>The current engineering lead is unqualified and inexperienced. There have been numerous technical arguments where it is all of the other engineers against the lead, which go nowhere. There have also been times where the lead has told me to do something which is wrong, and I have to explain why it makes no sense to do things in that way and what the proper way would be to do it (which the lead eventually agrees with, usually). The code the lead has written is also atrocious, and if I didn&#x27;t know better I would say it is actively malicious (in terms of nobody else is able to maintain it). The lead was the first engineer, which is the only reason I think they were promoted.<p>Being the first engineer is challenging and tech-debt will accumulate. However, the non-technical side of the company is very frustrated with how often everything breaks and I think they believe engineers are just bad at their jobs. It is really disheartening to have to explain that it shouldn&#x27;t be like this, and that I am trying to fix things but the codebase is not in a great condition and the lead has no interest in making it better. Non-technical folks have talked to me about just doing a rewrite, since there really isn&#x27;t much code, but the lead will not even consider the idea.<p>I really like the company as a whole and I agree with the mission. The founder is non-technical, and I think they do not know what poor engineering looks like, which is why this has continued to go on. I really want to just tell the founder &quot;Hey, your engineering lead is awful, you really need to find someone new.&quot;<p>What should I do in my situation? I am currently planning on leaving, and telling the founder then.

What do you think is the best next step in this situation?<p>Thanks!<p>PS: I know there are hacks to fix the issue, but the ones I have found void the warranty and basically require you to throttle the phone, which I would argue is not an ideal solution.","time":1535115179,"title":"Google Store warranty horror story: what to do next?","type":"story"},{"by":"_quhg","descendants":29,"id":17834514,"kids":[17836680,17836181,17838551,17835964,17837420,17836216,17839087,17835986],"score":101,"time":1535114227,"title":"The Origin of Stimulus JavaScript Framework","type":"story","url":"https://stimulusjs.org/handbook/origin"},{"by":"meridion","descendants":11,"id":17834580,"kids":[17836423,17837300,17836258,17835809,17834603,17836815,17839594,17847407,17839509,17835981],"score":44,"time":1535114998,"title":"Ask HN: What exciting open-source science projects can one contribute to?","type":"story"},{"by":"elijahparker","descendants":97,"id":17834437,"kids":[17834791,17835823,17835366,17834770,17835374,17834984,17838141,17834821,17835417,17834866,17837428],"score":68,"time":1535113207,"title":"There's No 'Safe' Level of Alcohol Consumption, Global Study Finds","type":"story","url":"https://www.livescience.com/63420-alcohol-no-safe-level.html"},{"by":"jakark","descendants":25,"id":17834427,"kids":[17836014,17844107,17851131,17849550,17840817,17834482,17838605,17842029,17845763,17837669,17837635],"score":31,"text":"I work in the south of France, for the past year and a half I have been hearing that engineers and software developers are missing and companies have been unable to fill roles for months and months.<p>Yet, I don&#x27;t see any significant raise in the salaries I&#x27;m being offered (2 years experience 40&#x27;000€ for 40 hour week), if the companies are so desperate to find developers why aren&#x27;t they making their offers more attractive?

I looked him up to get his address and to find if he has any social media.  Figured this would be pretty simple but my Google search found that he is a muliti-billionaire  who lives in a house about the size of a city block, is on the board of Berkshire-Hathaway and is childhood friend to Warren Buffett.  Myself in contrast I ate at Jack in the Box today, live in a condo is a small city in California that no one has heard of... and I drive a nice... but lovingly pre-owned car.<p>I have thought of the following ways to make contact but I am not really in-love with any of these ideas<p>1. I send a letter with some of the geneology and request for the photos.  Unknown if someone will look at it because he most-probably gets a lot of letters from crazy people and may have given up on anyone opening any of them.<p>2. He has a son, who does have Facebook but doesn&#x27;t seem to really use Facebook much.  I could send his son a Facebook message request but his son is a multi-millionaire who has a multi-billionaire father.  I don&#x27;t know maybe a 2% chance of that working.<p>3.  I looked up if he has a personal foundation, I figured I would write his foundation but his foundation address goes to a lawyer&#x27;s office.

As an example and the reason why I&#x27;m posting today my brother and I are working on a project that needed to capture sensitive data, e.g., social security numbers, date of births, etc. The task was to capture and make specific fields available to analytics, e.g., subscription type and other user-specific demographics useful for analytics. Today I just happened to be looking in the analytics and low and behold I see ALL the data in there, social security, etc. I couldn&#x27;t believe it but what made me even madder is when I confronted him about it he said do you really think I&#x27;m that stupid that I would leave it in there? In other words, trying to avoid the fact that it&#x27;s even in there in the first place, why would it be? It&#x27;s a constant pattern with him I find something and explain what I see, and he has an excuse. Really silly things that any developer that&#x27;s been coding for a year or two should know like make sure there are messages (error, success, etc.) after form submission doesn&#x27;t just redirect to a page that for one isn&#x27;t even logical to redirect too and two there&#x27;s no explanation of what happened after the user interacted with the website. To me these are very jr web dev things you should know yet time after time he will mark a task as complete and not do these things, he doesn&#x27;t check his work.

We initially started writing self-hosted equivalents of popular services but quickly found that there is a ton of great self-hosted software out there. It’s just a lot of work to actually run them and keep them up-to-date.<p>The idea with Cloudron is simple: you install the Cloudron platform on your server. You can then install apps like NextCloud, GitLab, Rocket.Chat from the App Store. Cloudron completely automates the installation. Seriously - all you have to provide is a domain to install it on and it will take care of the rest like DNS&#x2F;certs, databases, sandboxing, backups, authentication etc. The App Store provides continuous updates for the apps, so you can use them like any SaaS product (this is all no different from how mobile app stores work).<p>Most importantly, all your data is completely private&#x2F;local to the server - we don’t have access to your servers.<p>Our complete app list - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloudron.io&#x2F;store&#x2F;index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloudron.io&#x2F;store&#x2F;index.html</a>.<p>Seeing is believing.

I have a multi processor computer for my workstation at this time and I realize that there can be a big drop in performance if a process crosses the cpu interconnect zone when it has too many threads.

I have a bit of relevant experience in Python from computational physics courses and labs (lots of work with numpy and scipy).<p>My plan:\n- Finish cs50, (currently week 4)\n- Finish freecodecamp (currently done most of JS)\n- Then from there I have a huge list of courses and am unsure of what to focus on. E.g. cs50x for react native, cs193p from stanford, leetcode projects, project euler (I have about 20 done), I&#x27;ve found a bunch of courses on MIT OCW for algorithms and data structures. \nWriting it out now, it seems a bit scattered as I&#x27;m not sure what exactly I would need to get a position as a data scientist or software developer at say, Google.","time":1534378166,"title":"Ask HN: Canadian, physics degree, in aviation, want to move to tech in US, how?","type":"story"},{"by":"nimos","descendants":101,"id":17770987,"kids":[17771343,17771193,17771215,17771191,17771165,17771339,17772124,17771160],"score":92,"time":1534379918,"title":"MoviePass Owner Sued by Shareholders as Business Model Falters","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-15/moviepass-owner-sued-by-shareholders-as-business-model-falters"},{"by":"justin","descendants":3,"id":17770786,"kids":[17771366,17770834],"score":2,"time":1534377455,"title":"Founders and CEOs need to be proactive about diversity and inclusion","type":"story","url":"https://www.atrium.co/blog/startup-diversity/"},{"by":"zicostar","descendants":3,"id":17770775,"kids":[17771702,17771085],"score":3,"text":"What side projects have you worked on which you think made a significant positive impact on your career as a software developer?\nHow did you come up with the idea, and what were your lessons?","time":1534377382,"title":"Ask HN: What side projects did you work on to become a better software engineer?","type":"story"},{"by":"NaOH","descendants":151,"id":17770707,"kids":[17800021,17800757,17800584,17800056,17800037,17800035,17800791,17799860,17799936,17800146,17800579,17800922,17800096,17800575,17800634,17800159,17800977,17770967,17801198,17799908,17800713,17800029,17801189,17800142,17799852,17802810,17800460,17800054,17800585,17801547],"score":153,"time":1534376611,"title":"Why There Are So Many Thai Restaurants in America","type":"story","url":"https://munchies.vice.com/en_us/article/paxadz/the-surprising-reason-that-there-are-so-many-thai-restaurants-in-america"},{"by":"diminish","descendants":4,"id":17770708,"kids":[17778524,17770714,17772359,17771747],"score":1,"text":"Hi HN,<p>What are some Hacker News feedback and feature requests you had in your mind for news.ycombinator.com?

HN,<p>I’m Mitra Raman, the founder&#x2F;CEO of The Buttermilk Company (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thebuttermilkco.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thebuttermilkco.com</a>). We help you make authentic, fresh Indian food in 5 minutes by just adding water to our products.<p>As an Indian-American in my 20s, I grew up eating my mom’s homemade Indian food everyday. When I moved away from home to attend Carnegie Mellon University, I was homesick for the first time and realized how hard it was to find anything that resembled my mom’s food. I either had to make it myself (finding the Indian grocery store + following my mom’s recipe took way too much time) or would settle for whatever generic dishes at the local Indian restaurant. The options were expensive, time-consuming, or tasted horrible.<p>Two years into my job as an Software Engineer at Amazon, I asked my mom to help me make her rasam. She gave me all the ingredients in a ziploc bag and told me to just add hot water! I asked my friends about how they coped with homesickness and realized that most parents were also figuring out their own ways of getting their kids’ favorites foods to them when they moved. That’s how the idea for Buttermilk started!<p>We crowdsource our recipes from real people (keeping our product truly authentic) and develop them into products that are super easy for our customers to make. If you’ve ever asked your mom to send a family recipe to you, you know how hard it is to get this right! Our team spends hours in the kitchen tweaking each recipe so we can prep and cook it just enough that the customer can complete the cooking with water. We have to be careful to not over-prep such that the taste and nutritional value erode over time.<p>We use fresh and non-GMO ingredients, make everything from scratch (seriously, even the garam masala), and deliver our perishable products in sustainable packaging. Our production is extremely detail-oriented and time-consuming because we are recreating recipes for one family into large-scale batches that need to maintain the quality of its original recipe. To improve efficiency, we have built software to track food production, predict incoming volume, and help our production and fulfillment teams communicate. We’re also exploring new shelf-life extension technologies (such as HPP) so our products can last a lot longer. Currently, they must be refrigerated for 5-7 days or frozen for up to 3 months -- if you don’t eat them before then, that is!<p>In terms of market size: there are over 4 million Indian immigrants in the U.S. This demographic, like all other ethnic groups, is poorly served by the existing food options when it comes to their cuisines. And of course there is the population of everyone who just likes Indian food and can’t find or make it! Though we are starting with Indian cuisine, we definitely don&#x27;t plan to stop there. The market for ethnic foods in the U.S. is at least $5B. But in good startup style, we&#x27;ve started with the specific problem we ourselves had.<p>We’re super eager to hear your feedback, ideas, and experiences in this space or as it relates to our type of product.","time":1534353342,"title":"Launch HN: The Buttermilk  Company (YC S18) – Homemade Indian Food in 5 Minutes","type":"story"},{"by":"smacktoward","descendants":11,"id":17767649,"kids":[17767762,17768295,17767917,17767966,17767930,17767921],"score":27,"time":1534352538,"title":"QAnon and Pinterest Is Just the Beginning","type":"story","url":"https://hapgood.us/2018/08/15/qanon-and-pinterest-is-a-completely-predictable-disaster/"},{"by":"indumania","descendants":45,"id":17767625,"kids":[17767842,17769078,17768309,17768618,17769446,17769234,17769575,17774987],"score":83,"time":1534352445,"title":"What It Takes to Hold Your Breath for 24 Minutes (2017)","type":"story","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/what-it-takes-to-hold-your-breath-for-24-minutes-yeah-its-a-thing/"},{"by":"weirdtunguska","descendants":5,"id":17767736,"kids":[17775016,17775328,17774161],"score":85,"time":1534353008,"title":"Collective awareness, or the models that we use to understand the world","type":"story","url":"https://www.edge.org/conversation/j_doyne_farmer-collective-awareness"},{"by":"lazerpants","descendants":83,"id":17767454,"kids":[17768827,17768333,17769085,17769043,17768550,17768813,17769233,17769120,17768654,17769638,17769143,17770761,17768902,17768492,17768778,17768968,17770839,17768906],"score":56,"time":1534351431,"title":"Los Angeles to Use Body Scanners at Transit Hubs","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/15/us/los-angeles-metro-body-scanners.html"},{"by":"ilamont","descendants":50,"id":17767314,"kids":[17767644,17767413,17768021,17767742,17768192,17768283,17768127,17767876,17768002,17768059],"score":42,"time":1534350653,"title":"People living in storage units in order to avoid paying Boston rents","type":"story","url":"http://www.bostonherald.com/news/local_coverage/2018/08/officials_people_living_illegally_in_rented_spaces"},{"by":"abrax3141","descendants":3,"id":17767243,"kids":[17767297,17770072],"score":2,"text":"Before Unix, programming languages were careless.

I’m Agustin, founder of Fintual Inc, from YC’s S18 batch. We’re building an automated passive investment platform for Latin Americans (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fintual.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fintual.com</a>). I come from a computer science + business background so when we first started discussing this idea I didn’t have much experience on finance or investment other than what I had learned by playing around with Bitcoin. Since I graduated I knew I wanted to become an entrepreneur, but not having any work experience led me to pretty standard ideas like a music streaming website or a food ordering app. I realised rather late that I needed to join experienced partners to find better business insights and opportunities.<p>After many conversations with my current business partner Omar, who had been 8 years working for the largest wealth manager in LATAM, I was shocked to understand how Latin American people, including people around me, were unfairly paying enormous amounts of money to banks who offered very expensive and many times overly complex investment solutions to retail &#x2F; uninformed long term investors. After investigating how Betterment, Wealthfront and passive investment strategies in general had been changing the landscape for Americans, we were motivated to do whatever it took to solve this problem in LATAM starting from our own country Chile which, despite being a tiny country, has more than 60 billion dollars allocated in Mutual Funds by itself.<p>We started by building a responsive website using AngularJS and Ruby on Rails as quickly as we could to get user feedback soon, we mostly copied the onboarding process directly from Betterment. At the beginning we thought automating every step of the investment process was the most important challenge, but now, after some experience and several conversations with YC partners, we have come to realize the real problem to solve is none other than distribution: how to reach millions of users in an economically viable way. Banks already have the clients, while we have to explain and convince people there’s a better way. At first we tried to find an incumbent to work with us, but after a year trying we decided to get our own license (the equivalent to a FINRA Series 6 license) which took a large part of the seed round and 8 months of work, but finally got it. We’ve been growing at a healthy 10% week over week since March now thanks mainly to word of mouth, but we know we need to have a better handle on this growth for the future.<p>I’m very excited to be at this point, I have been reading HN for 10 years now and I only dreamed about making a YC launch post. As I said, we need to find a more consistent approach on growth, If any of you has any new idea or has heard of approaches of how could we get more people to realize they’re overpaying (some even pay 7% annual fees!) and get them to know and trust our solution, that would be awesome, but anyway, I’m eager to read and respond to whatever this great community has to say.","time":1534266518,"title":"Launch HN: Fintual Inc.

I&#x27;m the highest-ranked technical person, and I feel there isn&#x27;t any room to grow within the company or learn from a mentor.<p>However, the owners take very good care of me.

I spend 3.5 hours a day commuting.

For you personally, what service in particular do you feel would be of great benefit to your financial health, whether planning for a short term goal, long term retirement, not having to deal with the headache of financial matters (which is a leading cause of divorce and other societal issues), etc.?<p>I am open to any and all suggestions or criticisms.","time":1534011741,"title":"Financial Lifestyle Startup","type":"story"},{"by":"bad_ramen_soup","descendants":28,"id":17740743,"kids":[17740826,17742804,17741079,17746569,17741796,17741680,17744673,17743835,17742678,17740897,17744564,17742723,17741816,17757310,17740774],"score":33,"time":1534010193,"title":"Ask HN: What types of knowledge are worth knowing?","type":"story"},{"by":"al_ramich","dead":true,"id":17740712,"kids":[17740901,17742876],"score":1,"time":1534009766,"title":"Should rock stacking be banned?","type":"story","url":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-45146681"},{"by":"rohmanhakim","descendants":3,"id":17740635,"kids":[17741345,17741610,17741312],"score":20,"time":1534008764,"title":"Don’t do what you love for a career–do what makes you money","type":"story","url":"https://qz.com/819233/do-what-you-love-is-bad-advice-work-for-money-not-for-passion/"},{"by":"anw","descendants":63,"id":17740622,"kids":[17741190,17740855,17741302,17740775,17741396,17740821,17740838,17741001,17741218,17741197,17741359,17741290,17741885,17741112,17742524,17741405,17740853,17741327,17741520,17742978,17740817],"score":162,"time":1534008510,"title":"Bulma – Flexbox CSS framework","type":"story","url":"https://bulma.io/"},{"by":"pjmlp","descendants":8,"id":17740564,"kids":[17740839,17740890],"score":35,"time":1534007861,"title":"DX12 Ray Tracing Tutorials","type":"story","url":"https://news.developer.nvidia.com/dx12-raytracing-tutorials/"},{"by":"okket","descendants":23,"id":17740542,"kids":[17742311,17741318,17741060,17741291,17741512,17741472,17743053,17747586,17741470,17742792,17741317],"score":164,"time":1534007652,"title":"Meteor showers from space","type":"story","url":"https://www.meteorshowers.org/"},{"by":"classichasclass","descendants":8,"id":17740427,"kids":[17741440,17742387,17745797,17740470,17747455,17743179],"score":15,"time":1534006339,"title":"Who killed the great American cable TV bundle?","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-08-08/who-killed-the-great-american-cable-tv-bundle"},{"by":"henrik_w","descendants":73,"id":17740343,"kids":[17740689,17740742,17740623,17742434,17740416,17740929,17742964,17742798,17742397,17742545,17741271,17740429,17740390],"score":148,"time":1534005323,"title":"Bayesian analysis suggests that John Lennon wrote the music for 'In My Life'","type":"story","url":"https://www.npr.org/2018/08/11/637468053/a-songwriting-mystery-solved-math-proves-john-lennon-wrote-in-my-life"},{"by":"dangom","descendants":110,"id":17740292,"kids":[17740563,17740620,17740944,17740521,17740499,17740652,17743386,17740471,17743296,17745584,17740806,17743511,17742000,17740589,17740388],"score":301,"time":1534004679,"title":"Worst Computer Bugs in History: Therac-25 (2017)","type":"story","url":"https://blog.bugsnag.com/bug-day-race-condition-therac-25/"},{"by":"oblib","dead":true,"id":17740312,"kids":[17740752,17740726,17740484,17740709],"score":8,"text":"Sat an my desk this morning and opened a new Safari browser window and it loads an ad for an iPhone X from Apple.<p>I quit the browser, restarted it, same thing.

have always doubted whether I would be a successful programmer; in high school I excelled in history and politics. I pursued a BA, not a BS, in CS in college, and am doing reasonably well because of my effort. I have had some rough spots where I considered changing majors, but stuck with it, and learned some c,java,python, and sql in the process.  I doubt my own skills not because two months ago I started my Internship, and I messed it up terribly. The first two weeks I was not given a lot of work because my team was already in the middle of a huge project. My mentor told me to read the code. I did, but was slow to start, because I did not know where to begin, and slow to understand. By 3 weeks, I understood some of what junit tests and what spring was, two concepts heavily used in the code base, but could not really contribute. However, I would volunteer for a few little tasks each week. I also had a horrible habit of sleeping late, so I would show up to work tired and unmotivated. I told myself that I was reading the code, but really I round be distracted on my phone, ensnared in theology and history books. My manager was so stressed that I could get away with this. So I was listless and useless for a few weeks. Towards the end, my manager gave me two small projects, and I did each, although I was not good with keeping tabs with him each day. When I finished each, I wanted to show him, but he was not interested. I learned today that during this weeks where I would lazily “read code,” he was expecting me to take initiative and come up with ideas. I also should have not kept sleeping late. I just blew a six figure job away. I feel stupid and entitled (why was I so sure I would get a return offer?), but now feel the need for personal discipline and to really start coding and reading coding books in my free time.

Haven&#x27;t used all of them but have been to all their sites (not recently for a few of them). If there are others out there, I would love to know.

Pick one of our six cheese sauces, a pasta base, add unlimited toppings like roasted broccoli and mushrooms, and top it off with anything from truffle oil to hot cheetos. We’re currently in San Francisco and Portland.<p>MAC’D was inspired by a mac &amp; cheese restaurant called Homeroom, which Chen-Chen frequented while at Cal. Fast-casual has consistently been the fastest growing segment in the food and bev industry, so it made sense to apply that spin to an old-school comfort food like mac &amp; cheese. It’s a social, nostalgic, late-night meal that’s both familiar in taste and unique in experience.<p>After graduating from Berkeley, Chen-Chen was a management consultant, but quickly realized that consulting wasn’t the career for him. Together with a part-time partner, he began drafting up ideas for a restaurant concept. The one that struck a chord was mac &amp; cheese. After confirming high demand through several pop-ups in early 2017, Chen-Chen and his partner opened MAC’D’s first brick &amp; mortar in SF’s Marina District. About 6 months in, Chen-Chen’s partner made a decision to pursue business school, and Chen-Chen ran the restaurant solo until opening up a second location. Antony was a friend of Chen-Chen’s and had been following MAC’D’s progress while a software engineer at AWS. He worked in restaurants throughout his life and after a brief stint as a chef in Milan, knew he wanted a career in the food industry. Chen-Chen had been pretty spread thin running two locations with eyes on a third, and good timing on both ends led to our partnership.<p>In a little over a year, we’ve successfully bootstrapped two locations in SF and have served over 75,000 meals. We’re profitable and have a validated concept in a city with among the highest costs in the US. We want to continue to grow and expand to other cities.<p>In Portland, we’re using low capital commissary kitchens to explore new food markets through catering and delivery. Commissaries give a low managerial overhead and remove front of house staffing &#x2F; building costs. It’s a way of getting into new markets quickly and intelligently, with the goal of proving a market and getting our name out before investing in brick &amp; mortar spaces.<p>We’ve identified roughly thirty cities across the US as potential locations for MAC’D. Our customers range from families looking for a predictable meal to more boisterous late night crowds. Our target markets are college towns, cities in the south and midwest, and ones with progressive food scenes, both in and outside the United States. We’re also ramping up on catering, so if you’re in SF and Portland, reach out! Our catering form is on www.getmacd.com. We’re also on instagram @getmacd.","time":1533834449,"title":"Launch HN: MAC'D (YC S18) – Fast-Casual, Build-Your-own Mac and Cheese","type":"story"},{"by":"jhabdas","descendants":4,"id":17725989,"kids":[17728533,17729001,17732438,17729622],"score":4,"text":"So you&#x27;re begging up your privacy online.

They&#x27;re 14 years old and have a basic math background. I&#x27;ll have close to 40 hours of teaching time with these kids. The objective of the course isn&#x27;t immediate employment. I am hoping to get them more interested in the field and maybe get them started on programming on the side.<p>I need to design a 4 week course for them. Here is what I have right now:<p>Computer Fundamentals ~ 10 hours (Basic computer achitecture, basic networking, very basic introduction to OS)<p>Basic web design ~ 4-6 hours (Introduction to HTML, CSS, making a real simple webpage)<p>Introduction to JS ~ 16 hours (Introducing programming concepts like abstraction, simple JavaScript syntax like functions and variables, basic DOM interactivity)<p>Make a simple app from scratch ~ 10 hours (maybe a timetable or a to-do app to bring together most concepts we have been learning and get them excited about making new stuff)<p>Things I am skipping in the interest of time but unsure if I should:<p>Discrete Math, Logic, Algorithms, Datastructures, Linux&#x2F;UNIX, Lots of OS, Lots of Computer Architecture, A JS framework like React or Vue, Databases<p>Do you folks have any suggestions to improve the course? \nShould I include something key that I am missing?<p>I understand that I have not included very fundamental CS concepts but I am hoping these are things they can take up if  they express further interest in learning the subject.<p>Appreciate your feedback!<p>PS: If some of you can donate some Computer Hardware and can ship it to Mumbai, India, that would be awesome!

If yes, at what kind of companies &#x2F; Tech Writer jobs?<p>4) Any other useful info would be much appreciated.<p>Thanks!<p>-Sharon Su","time":1533770507,"title":"Ask HN: Software Engineers (SWE) turned Technical Writers – How did you do it?","type":"story"},{"by":"wolf550e","descendants":8,"id":17720495,"kids":[17720542,17731552,17731275],"score":21,"time":1533770617,"title":"ROCA vs. ROBOT: An Eternal Golden Braid","type":"story","url":"https://latacora.singles/2018/08/08/roca-vs-robot.html"},{"by":"pepys","descendants":7,"id":17720470,"kids":[17725525,17729025,17727133,17725590],"score":37,"time":1533770352,"title":"The Sex Life of Samuel Pepys (2016)","type":"story","url":"https://www.rmg.co.uk/discover/behind-the-scenes/blog/sex-life-samuel-pepys"},{"by":"raleighm","descendants":2,"id":17720296,"kids":[17721669,17722341],"score":7,"time":1533768633,"title":"Jack Dorsey's Dangerous Defense of Alex Jones","type":"story","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/the-most-powerful-publishers-in-the-world-dont-give-a-damn/567095/?single_page=true"},{"by":"curtis","descendants":14,"id":17720246,"kids":[17734725,17734929,17737313,17736158,17735102],"score":31,"time":1533768332,"title":"Ancient Mass Graves Could Be Filled with Tsunami Victims","type":"story","url":"https://gizmodo.com/ancient-mass-graves-could-be-filled-with-tsunami-victim-1828189360"},{"by":"curtis","descendants":30,"id":17720194,"kids":[17733803,17730568,17731081,17734659,17730632],"score":72,"time":1533767885,"title":"Humans May Have Reached North America by More Than One Route","type":"story","url":"https://gizmodo.com/humans-may-have-reached-north-america-by-more-than-one-1828194893"},{"by":"dhash","descendants":46,"id":17720128,"kids":[17720614,17720707,17720258,17720983,17720570,17720513,17720825,17721681,17730139,17720228,17721397,17720933,17720751,17721735,17721475,17720609,17748808,17720281,17720494,17742640,17721197],"score":176,"time":1533767427,"title":"Shannon Labs – $100K Fellowship to support independent researchers","type":"story","url":"https://shannonlabs.co/?hn"},{"by":"anuragbiyani","descendants":8,"id":17719916,"kids":[17721769,17720973,17721972],"score":75,"time":1533765785,"title":"F1 Query: Declarative Querying at Google Scale [pdf]","type":"story","url":"http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol11/p1835-samwel.pdf"},{"by":"ris","descendants":86,"id":17719848,"kids":[17720044,17722803,17720464,17720974,17720772,17720722,17722162,17721931,17720109,17720946,17720131,17721635,17720311],"score":302,"time":1533765320,"title":"Tomu, a tiny ARM microprocessor which fits in your USB port","type":"story","url":"https://tomu.im/"},{"by":"Thevet","descendants":9,"id":17719719,"kids":[17726225,17723776],"score":28,"time":1533764228,"title":"It’s Tough Being a Right Whale These Days","type":"story","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/07/you-really-dont-want-to-know-what-its-like-to-be-a-right-whale-these-days/566009/?single_page=true"},{"by":"tonyztan","descendants":3,"id":17719769,"kids":[17719832,17719814],"score":5,"time":1533764603,"title":"SpiderOak warrant canary to be replaced by 'transparency report'","type":"story","url":"https://boingboing.net/2018/08/06/spideroak-warrant-canary-to-be.html/amp"},{"by":"rossdavidh","descendants":46,"id":17719574,"kids":[17719593,17721221,17721365,17721670,17719706,17720375,17723386,17728565,17729007,17722142,17726352,17719996],"score":28,"text":"I don&#x27;t generally expect society to listen if computer programmers tell them to do or not do something.

We build software that lets biologists automate and transparently share their work. Our software glues together biologists&#x27; existing lab hardware and provides a seamless way for biologists to execute their protocols on it. Check us out at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;radix.bio&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;radix.bio&#x2F;</a> .<p>We think lab equipment is like mainframes were in the 1980’s - you have to program each one as a special snowflake. All that we&#x27;ve done is built an operating system so you can write a program once that runs on all of them. Just like developers write apps for android, they write recipes for Radix.  In the future with our technology, you’ll be able to download a recipe for making a coca-cola and if you have the right robots and precursors in your lab, they’ll just start making it.<p>Technically, we do this by making biologists describe their protocol in a formal language with verified operational semantics. We do this with a web UI, so they don’t have to  write “real” source code. We compile this protocol to our IR, deriving control and data flow graphs to inform our place-and-route algorithms. After the program is realized to robot&#x2F;lab instrument commands, we generate code to be run on the automated machinery. If the entire protocol can’t be totally realized by automation, we generate natural language instructions for humans to interact with the runtime system.<p>We go through this process to gain features you’re used to in your “normal” operating system. We provide a virtual memory abstraction so that programs compose, concurrency primitives for executing tasks in parallel and synchronizing access to fluids, and drivers to support a wide variety of different lab hardware.<p>These abstractions differentiate us from companies like Transcriptic and Emerald Cloud Labs by allowing us to write programs with branching control flows, support for on-premise deployments, a wider variety of compatible hardware, and an advanced optimizing compiler to allow users to specify optimization criteria like minimum execution time, minimum consumable usage, or max flow to run a lab as a high-throughput assembly line.<p>Right now we’re compatible with some pipetting robots (Opentrons and some Tecan robots) and we&#x27;re working on adding more devices. Contact us and let us know what you need automated.\nLaunch HN: Radix Labs (YC S18) - Software for Bio Lab Automation<p>We’re doing this to bring better lab-scale tooling to biologists, it currently costs 2.3B to get a new drug to market.

We’re building developer tools to simplify building, optimizing and maintaining Machine Learning models for embedded, mobile and IoT applications.<p>This platform is the result of our own struggles while helping on two ML powered projects; one using Computer Vision and one Voice Recognition. In both cases running models in the cloud was too expensive and slow for a good user experience. Moreover, it was not clear whether the training data our Data Science team had, at the beginning of the project, was representative of the data to be encountered in production.<p>The solution for cost and speed was to run inference on some end-device. However, we did not know which device would be feasible, nor did we know what model the Data Science team would end up with.<p>We initially considered two options:<p>* Postpone working on ML related software tasks until the Data Science team figured out what they wanted to do. Unfortunately, this meant that we could not parallelize the development. Moreover, the Data Science team would not get any feedback on the model runtime performance until we integrated them towards the end.<p>* Make a bunch of assumptions about models that the Data Science team would use and implement something. This would allow us to work in parallel, but we would be running the risk of having integration issues if those assumptions turned out to be wrong.<p>We looked for tools online to solve this but we couldn’t find anything comprehensive. So we decided to build our own! We settled on a design that packages ML models into (very primitive) serializable objects, encapsulating all the information and supporting files to use the models. For example, an object detection model would package the DNN graph, shape of the input and output tensor, bounding box anchors, etc.<p>This gave us what we wanted. On the software side we could write against the “interface” of the package. During initial development, we simply packaged dummy DNN models that always returned the same value. Later, the Data Science team would simply drop in a new package and everything just worked. One more victory for abstraction!<p>Since then, we’ve added a number of features around the packaging system. We can now add models during compilation or remotely through a cloud service and a user-friendly GUI. Models are versioned and report basic performance metrics to the cloud so Data Science teams can get feedback and guide model exploration. Remote delivery also allows sending different models to devices with different compute capabilities. We also added the possibility of running models on different runtimes (TensorFlow Mobile, TensorFlow Lite, our own library, Caffe2 is coming soon). Finally, we wrapped the app side code into ReactiveX API to make working with multiple models asynchronously easier.<p>Today we’re releasing the Numericcal Cloud Tools and Android SDKs in Beta. You can read about the system in more detail at (overview.workspace.numericcal.com) and check out demos (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;numericcal&#x2F;BetaDemoApp\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;numericcal&#x2F;BetaDemoApp</a>).<p>Machine Learning on mobile and IoT devices is yet to gain wide adoption. Making this transition will bring personalization of mobile apps and automation of business and industrial processes to a whole new level. We’re currently working on projects for automatic damage assessment on vehicles and preventative maintenance of mobile assets.<p>We hope these tools will add to the momentum by speeding up development iterations for other teams, as they did for us. In the long term, we plan to open source edge integration and packaging SDKs. We will also open up more of our cloud-hosted functionalities, such as automatic model benchmarking, deployment, model compression and runtime optimization as services.<p>We’re eager to hear comments, ideas and your experiences in building Edge applications with ML.

We offer the lowest prices on contact lenses online. On average, each of our customer saves $70 on each order in comparison to buying their contacts from a large online retailer.<p>It turns out that most of the cost of contacts is just advertising cost and fulfillment overhead. \nWe&#x27;ve built automation software for the fulfillment and prescription verification processes allowing us to cut overhead. We also use statistical models for ad optimization which allow us to cut our customer acquisition costs dramatically and deliver savings to our customers.<p>I have a technical background (I studied computer science and statistics, interned at Meteor (YC S11) and a quant hedge fund) and my Dad trained as an ophthalmologist. This was the perfect circumstance to realize that this is a large, fairly overlooked space within ecommerce where improved operations through software&#x2F;data science can have a strong impact.<p>We&#x27;re starting with contact lenses and we&#x27;ll eventually apply our core tech to other prescription medical products with very similar cost structures. At the end of the day, we&#x27;d like to make these products cheaper and more easily accessible. Help us out by buying contacts from us or telling your contact-wearing friends about us!<p>If you wear contacts: We sell the same contacts as your doctor or other retailers, just for a lot less money. Check out our website at beta.jetlenses.com - order from us and save some dough while supporting our run-up to demo day! You can also check out our price comparison tool at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beta.jetlenses.com&#x2F;compare_prices\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beta.jetlenses.com&#x2F;compare_prices</a> - we&#x27;re the cheapest\nfor most lenses but not all (yet!).<p>I would love to hear HN&#x27;s thoughts about this! I&#x27;m particularly keen to learn about your experiences buying contact lenses (or even other medical products) and if what we&#x27;re doing sounds exciting. You can also reach me at dhaivat AT jetlenses.com<p>Thanks!<p>Dhaivat<p>P.S.

All were rejected by the VP for reasons I was never able to pin down exactly. It&#x27;s probably my fault for not &quot;going to bat&quot; for the hires I wanted, but I was trying to be sensitive to the culture of the new company.<p>When the reorg came, I was told I was more of a &quot;Software Architect&quot; and not given the position of Director. Two other long-time employees were promoted to Director. I reported to one of them.<p>The same VP very publicly presented to the board of directors shortly after I&#x27;d arrived that we&#x27;d have a complete rewrite of our application within ten months, against my advice. In the meantime, anticipating a complete failure to deliver anything at all, I found a way to update the look and feel of the existing application while slowly replacing views. The actual delivery time was around four years (there were numerous &quot;shiny things&quot; distractions). Senior management didn&#x27;t seem to care, and there were no repercussions for the VP.<p>There is much, much more.<p>Now a newer (one year plus) employee has been given the Director role I&#x27;d originally been slated for. I have great respect for this person, and our VP and Directors actually seem to listen to them. This Director is asking me to consider an actual role as architect, within the next few months.<p>My question is: Given the experience I&#x27;ve had so far, should I stick around? I already feel like I&#x27;ve &quot;sunk costs&quot; on this one for way to long. I have little to no trust the VP or legacy Directors, and there are no other employees who have an Architect role.

I should probably give some backstory.  Without going into too much detail, when I was a kid up until the age of 12 I was bullied so badly by much older members of my extended family that it sent me to a downward spiral.  I didn’t fully recover until senior year of high school, where I finally made some friends, and at 22 I dated someone for the first time who would later be my wife.<p>But I was still isolated, at 23 I started getting panic attacks, and became very nervous in social situations for no apparent reason.  I couldn’t hold down any job because of fear of negative evaluation, ( I would literally freeze in place or be in utter confusion for minutes at a time)  I took everything from SSRIs to therapy, but strangely enough, the only thing that worked was running 7 days a week, something I gratefully discovered at 27 and now do habitually.  (haven’t been on medication since).  Now, at age 34, I still find it awkward to meet new people, even though I have been told by coworkers that I am quite affable, and am still at my job for 4 years (where prior I couldn’t hold down one longer than 3 months)<p>All that said, I am still underemployed and I feel a big part of that is a lack of connections.  I guess I’m posting here because ycombinator seems to attract a lot of formally shy people who became almost super-connectors.  There are also non-pragmatic reasons for this, I am lonely a I feel a big part of it is the discrepency between my desired network and my actual one.

We&#x27;re building a bug bounty platform for startups. (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.federacy.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.federacy.com</a>)<p>I was an early engineer at MoPub, responsible for security and infrastructure. By the time we were acquired by Twitter, we were 20+ engineers, but growing so fast that building software and systems securely was almost an impossible task. I found that there were never enough hands; I couldn’t peel engineers from revenue-driving features and it was really difficult to find contract or full-time security engineers.<p>William and I started Federacy to make it easier for startups to secure themselves. We think the key is to pair startups with extremely talented, outside security researchers to test their applications for vulnerabilities, review code, and help implement best practices—essentially serving as an outsourced CISO.<p>We saw that the best security minds we knew either weren&#x27;t interested in a full-time role for a single company, weren’t able to work in the United States, or already had day jobs at the largest Internet companies. We thought that if we provided an efficient, no-bullshit way for them to do work that they enjoy, make a real difference in how startups secure themselves, and make money while honing their skills, we could unlock a huge amount of talent that wasn’t accessible previously.<p>We have a lot of respect for what HackerOne and BugCrowd have built, but they are focused on serving mostly enterprise companies with large engineering and security teams, who can afford their services. Their revenue comes largely from triaging the high volume of low-quality and automated&#x2F;spam bug reports that come through their platforms. These services can be in the six figure range. It may be a good business, but that isn’t where our passion lies.<p>Startups can’t afford these services and the burden of triaging low-quality bug reports can completely overwhelm even the best dev teams, leaving them worse off than they started.<p>We think there is a better way:<p>• We hand-pair startups with a small team of pre-vetted researchers who are subject matter experts in your stack.<p>• Researchers test your infrastructure for vulnerabilities in an initial scan, and work closely with you to resolve issues and implement best practices.<p>• Your program can be private, where only you and the researchers you approve will have access to your program. You don’t have to provide source code and all initial testing is done with only the information and access your normal users have.<p>• We create your program for you and have you up and running in 5 minutes (or you can self-serve, if you prefer).<p>• We only charge for results (when a researcher finds a vulnerability).<p>We just started building a couple months ago and are looking for early feedback. Here’s an invite link we made for HN:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.federacy.com&#x2F;signup?invitation_id=3b4d06c5-ac02-4b9b-b0b9-4bf1e72f7f7f\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.federacy.com&#x2F;signup?invitation_id=3b4d06c5-ac02-...</a><p>We’ll be around all day to chat and are very happy to answer any questions as well as discuss how we built our product, security-related topics (systems automation, vulnerability reporting, coping with imposter syndrome, etc.), what it&#x27;s like building a startup with family (we’re twin brothers), or anything in between.<p>Some specific questions we have:<p>If you’re familiar with other bug bounty platforms, are there any issues we can tackle early on that made the experience frustrating for you?<p>Would you consider contracting an outsourced CISO or a pentest with a security researcher that has reported vulnerabilities to you through your bug bounty program?","time":1533231016,"title":"Launch HN: Federacy (YC S18) – bug bounties for

It’s improbable but it would be awesome if the customer management solution could even handle that part.<p>Any recommendations?","time":1533173604,"title":"Ask HN: What can I use for customer management with Stripe for billing?","type":"story"},{"by":"niutech","descendants":216,"id":17668401,"kids":[17669229,17668655,17669118,17668826,17668692,17670038,17668649,17669441,17670136,17669642,17671728,17670648,17668528,17671241,17669596,17670690,17669253,17675753,17672061,17669281,17670930,17669198,17669544,17668536],"score":271,"time":1533170850,"title":"Lubuntu is taking a new direction","type":"story","url":"https://lubuntu.me/taking-a-new-direction/"},{"by":"Parqyt","descendants":5,"id":17667837,"kids":[17668051,17668167],"score":2,"text":"Hello Everyone, we have launched our &quot;metered style,&quot; general parking for everyone to use!

There are usually some pretty smart people here.<p>In replacing spark plugs last night on a 2016 Ford Mustang - I had to remove my strut tower brace to remove the engine cover to gain access to the spark plugs.<p>The 2 bolts for the strut tower brace closest to the engine are 10mm by 1.25 thread pitch while the 2 farthest from the engine are 10mm by 1.5 thread pitch. (4 bolts on either side).<p>I got the nuts confused - they weren&#x27;t marked differently and I couldn&#x27;t see the difference in pitch - so... I stripped 2 of the 1.25 nuts - 1 on either side.<p>(I&#x27;m told I&#x27;m safe to drive it with 3 of the 4 properly torqued to 35lb until I can get a die to recut the bolts, and new nuts)<p>The question - \nWHY would a designer &#x2F; engineer use 2 different kind of bolts &#x2F; nuts - so closely to each other, providing the same purpose?<p>I&#x27;m curious what the reasoning is behind this. Do the different thread pitches provide different security for the bolt?<p>With the amount of boost I&#x27;m running (tuned) and methanol injection - I&#x27;m told I should change the plugs every 10-15k miles so this won&#x27;t be the first or last time the strut tower brace will need to come off.","time":1533117322,"title":"Ask HN: Different size nuts?","type":"story"},{"by":"pmcpinto","descendants":5,"id":17660946,"kids":[17670720,17669576,17669078,17668659],"score":36,"time":1533116227,"title":"Chocolate, bioterrorism and the birth of Brazilian funk","type":"story","url":"https://www.engadget.com/2018/07/27/bioterrorism-in-bahia-witches-broom-chocolate/"},{"by":"alxpez","descendants":10,"id":17660910,"kids":[17674532,17670266,17672438,17673743,17673528],"score":29,"time":1533115835,"title":"Show HN: Woye – Insert plain text, get information from YouTube and Wikipedia","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/alxpez/woye"},{"by":"misterdata","descendants":23,"id":17660883,"kids":[17661072,17661121,17661230,17661033,17661247,17662904,17661349,17661175,17661973,17661078,17661258,17661239,17661264],"score":168,"time":1533115425,"title":"Is it Pokemon or Big Data?

HN,<p>We&#x27;re Duncan, Austin, Jonathan, and Patrick, the founders of JITX (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jitx.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jitx.com</a>). Today, every circuit board is manually designed by skilled engineers. JITX is automating circuit board design with AI that designs optimized boards in hours instead of weeks.<p>This all started for us while we were still at UC Berkeley. Duncan and Austin were PhD students and constantly designing robots to test new ideas. We realized we had to start from scratch every time we started work on a new robot. All that work had to be thrown away, because you can’t reuse hardware designs like software. We wanted a way to design robots faster; we wanted a way to design better robots!<p>At the same time Patrick and Jonathan were building Chisel, an automated tool for digital logic design. The roboticists saw Chisel and got inspired. Patrick and Jonathan saw how people design circuit boards and were horrified. We hit it off and decided to solve the problem — we would make circuit board design more like software development: agile, flexible, reusable, fast.<p>Our core technology is inspired by the technology used for designing computer chips.  The introduction of Hardware Description Languages (HDLs, e.g. Verilog) in the 80s, revolutionized chip design. Instead of manually drawing the shapes that make up the circuit, engineers would instead express the intended behaviour of their circuit using code, and then have algorithms automatically translate that code into the necessary copper shapes. This workflow is what makes possible the billion-transistor chips we see today. We bring the same workflow to PCB design.<p>Circuit board design is a multidisciplinary challenge, and we have to factor in electrical engineering (circuit design, RF design, signal and power integrity), mechanical engineering (thermal, vibration), and manufacturing (cost optimization, DFM&#x2F;DFA&#x2F;DFT). Unsurprisingly, almost every subproblem is computationally intractable, so we use clever representations and heuristics to arrive at good solutions. There are a million details to keep track of across all of those disciplines, and it’s high time we get computers to do the bookkeeping.<p>To give you an idea of our workflow, here’s a link to the first demo we ever recorded: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;ra0SWTrLzhs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;ra0SWTrLzhs</a>. It’s rough and out of date (new demo here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;lYrY7iskgng\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;lYrY7iskgng</a>), but it helped us get into YC and shows the key ideas. Cliff notes: we describe circuit boards with a domain specific programming language, and then compile that language into hardware designs (and simulations, and schematics, and documentation, and manufacturing outputs). You describe what you care about at a high level, and then the system solves for everything you don’t specify.<p>For example, we request a board with BLE and a microphone, and the system selects matching key components from the library, solves for power supplies and component values, sources all the parts (thanks Octopart!), assigns pins, plans out placements, routes traces, and then exports a KiCAD project (board + schematic), and manufacturing outputs (BoM, Gerbers, etc.). If you care about the shape of the board, add it as a constraint; if you care about the position of a component, add it as a constraint; if you know which BLE chip you want, add it as a constraint. Design tools should be smart enough to solve for the million details you don’t care about, and optimize your design for what you do care about.<p>We started JITX to give everyone ready access to professional-quality boards, and today JITX runs as an electronics design contractor. You tell us what a circuit board needs to do, we use our tools to design the board, fab it, and get it back to you. We already do this faster than humans can, and our speed depends on the design. For product and proof-of-concept boards, JITX is on average 3x faster and also cheaper than human contractors.

I think I was always a little bit nervous about flying, but never enough to make me really anxious.<p>A few years ago, on a short flight to NYC, the plane went through a sudden turbulence. It was strong enough to send 2 flight attendants to the floor. It probably lasted 10-20 seconds and, during those seconds I thought we were going to crash because I had never experienced turbulence that strong.<p>Since then, I started to develop fear of flying. Even though I have flown since then, each time it has made me more anxious. Now I actively avoid flying.<p>After some introspection, I realized that I&#x27;m more afraid of the moments preceding the crash than actually dying. This fear got worse after I had a daughter because now I also picture how the last moments would be if she was by my side on a falling plane.<p>Rationally, I do know how infrequent plane crashes are, and how driving is more dangerous, but at the end I convince myself that the best way to not die on a plane crash is to not get on a plane. Since flying is not required for work, and I&#x27;ve already seen most of the world, it&#x27;s not hard to convince myself that I don&#x27;t need to get on a plane.<p>The last few times I&#x27;ve flown, I used a mental trick to help me get through it. I read that the odds of a plane crash is 1 in 1.2 million, so I used a random number generator to generate a number between 1 and 1.2 million, and then tried to guess what that number was. That gave me some relief but didn&#x27;t completely stop the bad thoughts.<p>How do I overcome my fear of flying?","time":1533053988,"title":"Ask HN: How to overcome fear of flying?","type":"story"},{"by":"sahin-boydas","descendants":69,"id":17654479,"kids":[17667852,17654550,17670379,17668879,17653957,17667120,17672642,17667535,17667610],"score":364,"time":1533053909,"title":"How we scaled Nginx","type":"story","url":"https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-we-scaled-nginx-and-saved-the-world-54-years-every-day/?ref"},{"by":"Tomte","descendants":9,"id":17654434,"kids":[17655313,17656589,17655333],"score":14,"time":1533053586,"title":"Nintendo Has Sold 19.67M Switch Consoles to Date","type":"story","url":"http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/07/nintendo_has_sold_19_67_million_switch_consoles_to_date"},{"by":"therealmarv","descendants":2,"id":17654378,"kids":[17654524,17661002],"score":3,"time":1533053165,"title":"Press '?' on Facebook Desktop and you will see keyboard shortcuts","type":"story"},{"by":"okket","descendants":216,"id":17654220,"kids":[17654746,17654648,17656495,17654749,17655921,17660488,17654638,17654632,17655768,17654701,17654618,17654725,17656398,17655368,17657499,17662347,17656911,17654650,17657873,17654794,17658251,17665112,17659936,17658382,17655111,17654571,17660611,17660196,17658339,17655009,17661893,17655206],"score":824,"time":1533052128,"title":"Teenager Finds Classical Alternative to Quantum Recommendation Algorithm","type":"story","url":"https://www.quantamagazine.org/teenager-finds-classical-alternative-to-quantum-recommendation-algorithm-20180731/"},{"by":"dsr12","descendants":2,"id":17654183,"kids":[17654878,17654656],"score":14,"time":1533051983,"title":"Why we never sold Basecamp by the seat (2017)","type":"story","url":"https://m.signalvnoise.com/why-we-never-sold-basecamp-by-the-seat-4482f3e6a195"},{"by":"phantom_oracle","descendants":79,"id":17654165,"kids":[17655236,17654557,17654615,17654938,17654512,17656350,17655062],"score":160,"time":1533051877,"title":"Tencent loses $143B in market value","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-31/think-u-s-tech-is-bad-check-out-tencent-s-140-billion-selloff"},{"by":"wemdyjreichert","descendants":17,"id":17653906,"kids":[17657794,17654668,17655806,17656019,17664460,17653977],"score":20,"time":1533050639,"title":"Ask HN: Is Magic Leap just vaporware?","type":"story"},{"by":"ahubert","descendants":2,"id":17653893,"kids":[17654353,17654599],"score":4,"time":1533050569,"title":"Should C Programmers learn C++, Go or Rust?","type":"story","url":"https://ds9a.nl/articles/posts/cpp-rust-go/"},{"by":"hsikka","descendants":6,"id":17653742,"kids":[17662715,17655411,17653837,17653782],"score":6,"text":"I&#x27;m speaking specifically about the US.

We&#x27;re Jono and Brendan, the founders of Toybox (YC S18). Toybox lets designers, marketers, and copywriters communicate changes to developers on any website, without having to write code. These changes get annotated as CSS edits so engineers can understand, reply, and implement the fixes (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.toyboxsystems.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.toyboxsystems.com</a>).<p>For years Jono and I have struggled to communicate changes with one another during the development cycle. As a UX designer and Jono as a full-stack engineer, we spend hours going back-and-forth, trying to make small but important tweaks to sites. This was by far the most frustrating part of our jobs, driving us to try to solve this age-old problem.<p>While learning about the development to design handoff, we’ve come across some common challenges teams face. First, not all companies have sophisticated or easy to deploy staging environments to quickly share works-in-progress. Second, some designers make tweaks using Chrome Inspector, but these changes don’t persist and are recorded nowhere near the relevant web page. Lastly, the majority of these conversations are happening in unofficial and unformalized spaces, making it easy to dismiss and disregard.<p>The first problem we attempted to solve was creating a way to share web pages without a staging environment. To do this, we built a chrome extension that collects and sends the rendered DOM of the current page to Toybox. People write HTML and CSS in creative ways, so making sure we accurately re-render the captured page within Toybox has consistently been a fun and difficult challenge (looking at you CSS in JS...).<p>We built Toybox in a way that doesn’t require prior front-end knowledge to use. We created an inspector that makes any page feel like Squarespace—a universal WYSIWYG of sorts. As you make tweaks, those edits get saved as CSS allowing a developer to contextually review where on the page a change was requested and the relevant code required to resolve that change. To see it in action, we made a demo of Hacker News here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.toyboxsystems.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;Zodzjmzhpx3w\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.toyboxsystems.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;Zodzjmzhpx3w</a><p>We&#x27;re excited about the possibilities of having a rendered web page within Toybox. We’re currently testing the concept of style and component linting. Instead of the rules being tabs vs. spaces :) we can lint for incorrect uses of color, accessibility, typography, button styles, and so forth by using design files or style guides as inputs. With the rise of component libraries and design systems, we’re excited to further automate these QA efforts and make this communication channel even smarter.<p>We’d love to hear your feedback and personal experiences when it comes to this phase of the development process.

Who is still playing interactive fishing games and holding rifles in Call of Duty? Part of the reason it didn&#x27;t stay was because it never actually improved playing performance. We tend to forget, hardcore gamers makeup a large audience of the whole industry. In my and many others definition, this being users who play games in their leisure. VR doesn&#x27;t help gamers improve in traditional gaming, if anything it actually impairs them when playing online with keyboard and mouse wielding opponents having a more accurate edge.<p>I will agree, it does bring a new experience to the way we play games, but so has motion-based gaming.

I am mid 20s and thought I already reached my career goals only to find out I am still unhappy with the need for a change.<p>I am coding since I&#x27;m 10. I love(d) it. I was working in tech ever since. This year I had the chance to co-found a company with very nice conditions for me. I always wanted to have a team of good engineers to &quot;make it better than all the other guys doing so much stuff wrong&quot;. This I got now and after only a few months I realized this doesn&#x27;t make me happy at all.<p>I have a decent apartment, a good working relationship with my SO and a way above-average salary and freedom at work for being CTO of that company. Basically everything I always thought are my career goals. Still, unhappy, thinking every morning to skip going to work today. It should be the other way around: being excited and love going to work to manage my team and do a bit of coding.<p>I always loved being around with friends, engineers and people I really respect due to their cleverness, loyalty and intelligence. I probably thought I will get this situation by hiring great people to have an environment I like 24&#x2F;7. Reality is that I quickly realized that employees are not friends and that only because they are good engineers this does not mean at the same time that they have the characteristics I love to be around with all day long. To even make the situation worse I continuously lost my drive to code. It got boring for some reason. I cannot motivate myself to start a new project or getting a module done way quicker as I do currently.<p>How can I even motivate a team when I&#x27;m not even self motivated?<p>I really think I&#x27;m just a stupid idiot not realizing what I have here or could it be that my goals are actually different to what I originally thought they are?<p>Can someone recommend ways to actually find out about these?

They are struggling to understand which images they are supposed to select, even using prescribed glasses. The whole experience affected my mother so much that she cried when, after 2.5 hours, she was able to register her account, maybe out of happiness.<p>My grandparents didn&#x27;t do any better. We resorted to make a video call so I could tell them which images to select, but obviously this is not a solution in the long term. They will surely face this challenge over and over again. I fear that I will not be there to help them all the time. I want to know what is a good way to teach non-tech-savvy people about this type of things.<p>Note #1: I understand how Google reCaptcha works. It will stop showing the image-selection challenge after some time, when the user&#x27;s behavior can be detected with enough accuracy to consider them a non-artificial entity <i>(aka. robot)</i>. But with the little amount of time that my family spend on the computer, I am sure that they will have to face the infamous Google reCaptcha for a few months.<p>Note #2: The problem with the images is not with the quality of the pictures, but with the fact that they don&#x27;t know if the objects in the squares are part of the category requested in the challenge. For example, my grandfather asked a couple of times if a truck could be selected even though the challenge was requesting to select only buses. Road signs were the most difficult ones to solve, some of them were too small, or were spread across different images, they though that selecting the image image would be enough, but clearly it wasn&#x27;t <i>(clearly for me, not for them)</i>.","time":1532813422,"title":"Ask HN: How to help my parents and grandparents understand Google reCaptcha?","type":"story"},{"by":"okket","descendants":10,"id":17635162,"kids":[17635287,17635304,17635310,17635339,17642329,17635284,17635544,17639482],"score":14,"time":1532813386,"title":"Reality Show Fame Is More Lucrative Than an Oxford or Cambridge Education","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-26/love-island-fame-is-more-lucrative-than-an-oxbridge-education"},{"by":"wheresvic1","descendants":0,"id":17635136,"kids":[17635257,17635241],"score":2,"time":1532813037,"title":"ES6: The Bad Parts","type":"story","url":"https://benmccormick.org/2018/06/05/es6-the-bad-parts/"},{"by":"kpozin","descendants":78,"id":17635063,"kids":[17637944,17638985,17638018,17637786,17638119,17636764,17641877,17638056,17638884,17638630,17638267,17638893,17637403,17636432,17637816],"score":85,"time":1532812091,"title":"A $3B Plan to Turn Hoover Dam into a Giant Battery","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/07/24/business/energy-environment/hoover-dam-renewable-energy.html"},{"by":"DanBC","descendants":10,"id":17635021,"kids":[17638207,17637948,17638274,17640589],"score":75,"time":1532811509,"title":"Visualizing the Hidden ‘Logic’ of Cities","type":"story","url":"https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/07/see-your-citys-street-structure-with-these-tools/566138/"},{"by":"dEnigma","descendants":2,"id":17634982,"kids":[17635125,17635035],"score":3,"time":1532810951,"title":"Nautilus 3.30","type":"story","url":"https://csorianognome.wordpress.com/2018/07/27/nautilus-3-30/"},{"by":"mattlong","descendants":3,"id":17634949,"kids":[17634981,17635736],"score":56,"time":1532810475,"title":"Watch the Live Stream of YC's Work at a Startup Expo","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdpRbJ8Pc9s"},{"by":"okket","descendants":23,"id":17634935,"kids":[17637097,17636178,17637659,17635584],"score":59,"time":1532810319,"title":"Resistant protocols: How decentralization evolves","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@jbackus/resistant-protocols-how-decentralization-evolves-2f9538832ada"},{"by":"wheresvic1","descendants":16,"id":17634814,"kids":[17635192,17635992,17635346,17635151,17635990,17635963,17635398,17637120,17635895,17635888],"score":95,"time":1532809038,"title":"QuickMockup","type":"story","url":"https://jdittrich.github.io/quickMockup/"},{"by":"okket","descendants":70,"id":17634772,"kids":[17635565,17635003,17635631,17635808,17635572,17635261,17635089,17635480],"score":35,"time":1532808540,"title":"Steven Pinker’s case for optimism","type":"story","url":"https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2018/02/24/steven-pinkers-case-for-optimism"},{"by":"shawndumas","dead":true,"id":17634763,"kids":[17637494,17638305],"score":4,"time":1532808418,"title":"The Jell-O Family Curse","type":"story","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/07/the-jell-o-family-curse"},{"by":"erichileman","descendants":2,"id":17634710,"kids":[17695043,17642166],"score":1,"text":"I&#x27;ve been load testing z1d last couple days and cpu&#x27;s are always set at the base 3.4GHz.

for obvious reasons; on HN since 2012; 25 years old]\nI&#x27;m one of you who hangs out on HN&#x2F;PH&#x2F;Reddit. I joined CS in 2011, then dropped out to start freelancing (because I couldn&#x27;t pay college fees) in 2013. After three years, in late 2016 I quit freelancing, and since then I&#x27;ve been building utility apps and simple mobile games for the last two years. Some of my apps are bringing me Ad revenue; combined revenue from my projects might sustain me for a couple of years.<p>By working in dozens of small-scale projects, I have gained a diverse range of skills; I&#x27;m pretty good at Unity3D, image manipulation using C++, native mobile apps, system&#x2F;server administration (setting up web&#x2F;mail&#x2F;database servers and containers). Since I have had a passive revenue stream, I find myself spending a lot less time working; I just spend most of my time reading articles on Medium&#x2F;HN&#x2F;PH and tinkering with new technology, without any motive of commitment with any of those (take blockchain and flutter as two examples).<p>My apps might support me for 9-12 months without actively maintaining them. Personally I&#x27;d like to involve myself in a project that doesn&#x27;t only involve writing CRUD and APIs. I&#x27;m pretty burnt out of all these stuff. I feel I&#x27;m doing the mindless programming even if I&#x27;m solving interesting problems in a while. I think I&#x27;m not working on something important enough, and will soon lose my passion for development. To fix this I have thought of three options-<p>i. help the open source community, because without it I&#x27;d probably be selling peanuts in the railway station,<p>ii. start working on to hardware&#x2F;IOT with a lot of learning (Logic, Computer architecture, signals, boards, basic electrical, etc.)<p>iii. work on a technology that is promising, as well as interesting enough for coming years, like ML&#x2F;AI&#x2F;DL<p>I&#x27;m not a native speaker of english, and belong to the 3rd world country in South-East Asia, please pardon my ignorance of language.

We’re Jacob and Miguel, founders of RevenueCat (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.revenuecat.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.revenuecat.com</a>). We’re taking the pain out of building a business on in-app subscriptions.<p>Before starting RevenueCat, Miguel and I worked together at Elevate (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elevateapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elevateapp.com</a>), Apple’s 2014 App of the Year. Elevate is a brain training app that monetizes with in-app subscriptions. We found that while the subscription model was essential to the business being viable, implementing it was time consuming, complicated, and boring. We needed to see and react to customer level data on LTV, churn, and conversion and it just wasn’t possible without building our own, complex subscription tracking infrastructure.<p>RevenueCat is an Android, iOS, React Native, and Unity SDK that allows you to get up and running with subscriptions (with all the bells and whistles) in a couple of hours instead of weeks or months. We’ve found and cataloged the nuances and bugs of the platform in-app purchase APIs and wrapped around them to provide a stable and easy to implement API that is consistent on all platforms.<p>Right now we provide cross-platform status tracking, receipt validation, customer management, and charting for MRR, conversion rate, and more. Our plan is to become a full revenue management platform, so app makers can focus on making their app useful, and we’ll handle making sure it makes money. There are lots of standard monetization strategies (price testing, lifecycle offers, sales, churn prevention, etc.) that most app developers simply don’t have the time to implement and maintain. These things can make a huge difference to revenue (we saw it first hand).<p>We believe mobile software is undervalued and subscriptions can help. Right now, it’s too hard for developers to do them right. We want to fix that.<p>I’d love to hear your thoughts, fears, and desires! We’re working on adding more SDKs (Xamarin, Cordova, etc.) Sound off in the comments if there is one you’d like to see. Also, if you have an app that wants to try subscriptions or monetize them better reach out, we can help.","time":1532537609,"title":"Launch HN: RevenueCat (YC S18) – Simple API for Managing In-App Subscriptions","type":"story"},{"by":"nuna","descendants":22,"id":17610669,"kids":[17611904,17610831,17612298,17611413,17613848,17611094,17616420,17615137,17627186,17613535,17612161,17634452,17612218,17620043],"score":27,"text":"I refactored our code and made a library that improved our work.

well.

We&#x27;re a single GraphQL endpoint that brings together all your SaaS APIs.<p>We make it easy to build integrations for your app into services like Salesforce, Stripe, GitHub, Clearbit,  and Gmail. Since each service’s API is unique you usually have to read their documentation, implement their specific authentication, make very specific calls to their servers, etc.—it seems normal right now, but all of this adds up.<p>Both of us have done plenty of integrations into these services for different startups over the years, so we knew intimately how painful it can be, especially when you have to coordinate data from multiple services.<p>Then GraphQL came along, and we saw that it could be a query language for all of the APIs we wanted. We can express our data requirements—even between services—succinctly, and let a single execution engine figure out how to translate those requirements to specific API calls.<p>We’ve built a GraphQL service that does just that - it knows how to talk to each backend API we support to pull out exactly the data you need. Here’s an example of how it works:<p><pre><code>  {\n    youTubeVideo(id: &quot;YX40hbAHx3s&quot;) {\n      snippet {\n        title\n        uploadChannel {\n          snippet {\n            title\n          }\n          twitterLinks { # twitter accounts associated with the channel\n            twitter(first: 5) {\n              tweets {\n                text\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\n(You can see the full result of the query <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;sgrove&#x2F;5f17d046e535763c3c85258054ed00fb\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;sgrove&#x2F;5f17d046e535763c3c85258054ed0...</a>\n or play with it yourself <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2NL89GA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2NL89GA</a>)<p>We charge based on the services you’re integrating with, whether you want white-label authentication for your users, and overall usage.

We started as a democracy - trying to discuss and plan everything between us. But as time went by I feel those best intentions kind of backfired.<p>We often couldn&#x27;t agree on the direction of the product, pricing, marketing and features to develop - which led to heated arguments at times. The bigger problem was that it was seldom resolved - each of the founders pretty much ended up implementing their own idea. We tried addressing this a few times over the years, using different methods&#x2F;products&#x2F;solutions to try to plan and structure this. But after some time - things always returned to what they were.<p>To a point where it stopped being fun for me. I&#x27;ll go on a vacation and come back to find features implemented that we never discussed or I was against. Or offers being sent out to clients with amended pricing. Meetings are now almost painful for me and I think about it so much that it kind of paralyses me from doing &#x27;real&#x27; work.<p>Have considered quitting before but I poured so much of my time&#x2F;craft into the product in general that I just didn&#x27;t want to let go and was always postponing that decision. But I might have no choice - is just not fun any more and I don&#x27;t see how it could get better in the future.<p>Anyone with similar experiences? How did you resolve it?<p>----\nEDIT: the company is private i.e. bootstrapped and funded by the founders (mostly client work&#x2F;sales) so no issues with stock&#x2F;investors.

Although I like what I am doing, lately, I have the intention that I am not satisfied with the conditions and the environment. More specifically, I feel that there is not much personal and career development going on around and that keeps me in a stationary&#x2F;demotivated position.  After work, I am usually trying to program and study, but I feel that my progress is slow. I also thought of moving to a different position in a new company. However, though, the market standards are quite high, and I feel that I am going to land something similar. I am familiar with the following technologies; Docker, MongoDB, ElasticSearch, MySQL, Java, Python, PHP, Web Frameworks such as Flask, Django, Phalcon and JavaScript (now into the process of learning React).

am sympathetic to many libertarians ideas; however, I have a hard time getting past a few thoughts.<p>For instance, if we adopted a libertarian alternative for the reduction of our government and the freeing our our markets we might be - in aggregate - a wealthier country, many people would end up in abject poverty because they cannot acquire an sustaining income (for whatever reason). For instance, the argument I hear against the minimum wage is that it suppresses the number of jobs available (i.e. If a worker can only provide $5&#x2F;hr worth of production for their employer, but there is an $10&#x2F;hr minimum wage, then the employer will not hire that person at 10&#x2F;hr and so that person doesn’t get a job. Alternatively, they <i>could</i> have a job if the minimum wage was removed and the employer was able to hire them at 5&#x2F;hr. Ok, sure - 5&#x2F;hr is better than 0&#x2F;hr. Now, if a person can only pull in a 5&#x2F;hr - or 2&#x2F;hr - wage that subsequently leaves them unable to access healthcare, education, nutritious foods, etc. in a free marketplace, then what is the libertarian answer to their poverty (or the inevitable social costs of their poverty)? Leave them to die on the streets?<p>Likewise, how does libertarian thought confront monopoly power? Ostensibly, our government is designed to distribute certain rights and powers to all citizens. If we eliminate those rights and powers, what protects me - as a relatively poor and uninfluential human being - from being exploited by my more powerful businessman, landowner, etc.? It seems to put too much faith in everyday people to act morally - or if not morally, at least altruistically. In a libertarian environment, what is preventing a monopoly from wielding private power (rather than taking advantage of public power e.g. regulatory capture) to secure or maintain their position?<p>I’m genuinely trying to understand this political&#x2F;ethical worldview.","time":1532364984,"title":"Ask HN: Libertarian thoughts on poverty/monopoly power?","type":"story"},{"by":"scottndecker","descendants":3,"id":17593912,"kids":[17598099,17594154],"score":1,"text":"<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lifetimeofweeks.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lifetimeofweeks.com&#x2F;</a><p>Just created this over the weekend.

Designers today use tools like Sketch to design websites, web apps, or mobile apps, but these tools are limited and static. After experiencing the pain first-hand for over a decade, we resigned ourselves to try to make any kind of improvement we could.<p>We started by building our own fully-featured design studio software that allowed users to design iOS apps and export Swift code. But we quickly learned that although people were excited about it and tried it out, after about a week they went back to using Sketch. We realized that while writing algorithms for a layout engine is hard, getting adoption for your new product is harder!<p>Luckily one of our users pointed us in the right direction when they said that out of everything we’ve built, they were only really excited about our Auto-Layout engine. And so we decided to yank out our Auto-Layout solution and release it as a Sketch plugin. That was the turning point for us. Auto-Layout became very popular (100k users) and to this day is a main engine of growth for us.<p>In the past year and a half we shipped three products:<p><pre><code>  • Auto-Layout - Responsive Design for Sketch[1]  \n  • Launchpad - Export Sketch to HTML[2]  \n  • Timeline - Interaction Design for Sketch[3]\n</code></pre>\nThe team consists of Michal, our co-founder&#x2F;designer and 2 technical founders, myself (Avishay) and Or (previously founded the Yo app).<p>Of course we are dogfooding our products and have built our websites using our own tools.<p>We’re sure that Hacker News readers will have a ton of experience in this space, and would love to hear about your experiences and ideas!<p>[1] <a

You can test that here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;acunniffe&#x2F;optic-networking-code-demo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;acunniffe&#x2F;optic-networking-code-demo</a>.<p>We have also had teams configure Optic to:<p><pre><code>  - Write&#x2F;Maintain standard tests for their React components\n  - Migrate to GraphQL by generating wrappers for each endpoint\n  - Generate&#x2F;Maintain CRUD routes from models\n  - Wrap their Tensorflow models in APIs\n\n</code></pre>\nThere’s a checkered history of optimism and failure around automated programming and many tools have promised to make developers&#x27; lives easier. In each generation of programmers there’s an acknowledgement that much of the code we write is routine, but none of the solutions have caught on. I failed once before when I founded Dropsource. While we built that product into one of the most popular tools for non-programmers to build mobile apps, we failed at our goal of building a tool we ourselves or other developers would use.<p>I left the company and went into research mode for around 18 months. A lot of the automated programming projects do their functional job well, but when it come time to integrating into a developer’s workflow they are littered with tradeoffs. Automation isn’t worth it if it means giving up control, rewriting lots of code, rebuilding your app visually, describing your project in some foreign dsl, or becoming tied to a vendor. Many of these projects haven’t caught on because the tradeoffs of using them have been too high.<p>When I started working on this problem again I was determined to get the developer experience right. For me this meant making Optic:<p><pre><code>  - work with your existing code \n  - plug in to your favorite IDE\n  - useful throughout the lifetime of your project\n\n</code></pre>\nI knew that whatever product I ended up building would need to interface with source code so I started building an API for code that let you:<p>GET JSON objects describing different types of code. Powered by a regex like pattern matcher we wrote that walks AST Trees.<p>PUT new values of the same shape back to update the code. This was the hardest part by far. We ended up training decision trees on different programming languages using the raw code and the resulting AST tree as input. We use these models to regenerate code in the smallest sections possible so formatting and manual changes are preserved.<p>POST new code into the project. This was actually the easiest. A generator can be reformulated as a Parser + Mutator so we bootstrapped all the generation in Optic by combining the GET &#x2F; PUT functionality.<p>This API was really powerful and it became the foundation of Optic. Generating code, doing transformations, syncing projects — all Optic’s major features are built on top of this API. It’s such a solid foundation (you get parsing, generating and the round-trip problem in a box) that I believe a lot of new meta-programming tools will be built on our platform. Our work is open source (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;opticdev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;opticdev</a>) and there will always be a free-forever version available. We plan to make money from some specialty features aimed at larger teams.<p>It’s still the early days but we hope to build Optic into a valuable open source resource that improves the workflow of developers and their teams. I’m looking forward to hearing your feedback, experiences and ideas for tasks we should automate.

It was bearable to be able to not pick what I am working on, but now I have to follow word for word what a Senior developer says is right. This doesn&#x27;t allow me to grow.<p>The past few months I have been solely focused on a subsystem at work. Now that I&#x27;ve worked on it, I feel confident in my ability to solve problems &#x2F; bugs it has, but it&#x27;s very discouraging when all of a sudden a manager decides that the Senior developer has ultimate authority over my work and comes in making order &#x2F; commands and basically throwing out work I&#x27;ve done. I spoke to the manager in question about this, and they basically said I have to get approval before I make ANY changes from here on after. The difference between my patch for this task and the Senior developers instructions were minimal. He just wanted it done in his way, and not mine. Basically all of my work was wasted. I was never even told &quot;why&quot; that way I implemented the patch was wrong, just that it wasn&#x27;t liked.<p>I believe the problem is the Manager did not communicate that I needed to get permission, or &quot;guidance&quot; from this Senior developer, and then in the end, when the Senior didn&#x27;t like it, and I voiced my concerns about how this work will be wasted, he suggested that in the future I communicate all code changes with both him and the Senior. This leaves me no room for growth, but as a puppet being controlled by the strings.<p>Is this literally what I&#x27;m going to encounter in every job I have? Having to be micromanaged?

We crowdsource food poisoning reports, and help detect and prevent outbreaks.<p>I launched Iwaspoisoned.com after experiencing a brutal bout of food poisoning from a deli in my hometown of Tribeca, NY. Out of concern for other consumers I called the deli to try and explain what happened and they hung up the phone. That inspired me to create a crowdsourcing platform to allow people to report. The idea was that if it was easy to discover if others were also sick after eating there, that would be useful information not just for other consumers but also for the deli owner.<p>Foodborne illness sickens 48 million consumers, and kills 3,000 every year in the US, according to US Center for Disease Control estimates. The financial burden is also significant. The total national cost of foodborne illness is estimated at $55 to $92 billion per year. and the impact on companies can also be significant, Chipotle lost $10 billion in market cap from its peak to its lowest point after it’s series of food safety missteps, and the founder and CEO was forced to step down.<p>We built a mobile responsive website with a simple form that allows consumers to report when they believe they have food poisoning. We moderate every report, with both a back end review, and front end&#x2F;human review of each submission with the goal of eliminating malicious and inauthentic reports. We then geo analyze the data in real time, allowing us to pinpoint clusters of reporting associated with a single store, looking for multiple independent reports associated with the same store or location in the same time frame. We also store and analyze historial data. We developed an index and benchmarks that enable us to identify brands with negative and positive trends.<p>With our data, we predicted that Chipotle would have food safety issues ahead of their series of outbreaks, and we detected several of their outbreaks, and many others in real time.<p>Our business sells data intelligence to industry, focusing on enterprise clients in the restaurant industry. We offer daily alerts, intraday (outbreak) alerts, benchmarking, and secure messaging, plus an API service. We have also had interest in custom email branding&#x2F;messaging, and &quot;Dinesafe Certification&quot; for those brands that rank consistently well in our analytics.<p>We now provide daily alerts to over 25,000 consumers, sending over a quarter million emails a month. We partner with and provide daily surveillance services to public health agencies in 6 countries. Within the US we partner with over 350 public health agencies, covering 90% of the US by population. We also provide services to the food Industry, primarily restaurants, but also producers, the grocery and convenience sectors and more. We have over a third of the top 50 restaurant chains in the US on our platform.<p>We are delighted to be on Hacker News, and look forward to hearing insights from the community.

If the ET didn&#x27;t know the bit rate, it would be impossible for it to determine whether there was 100 ones or 10 ones encoded in the signal unless some zeroes were present as well--that is, unless the signal was modulated.

Since then, I&#x27;ve occasionally tweeted about it, and gone through various phases of motivation to properly push&#x2F;advertise&#x2F;market it, but that side of it feels completely unnatural to me, I&#x27;m far more happier sitting behind the screen, building the product.<p>It gathers 1-2 sign ups a week, but zero conversions.<p>My specific question is, what the heck do I do with it?<p>In my opinion, it is my most complete piece of software that I&#x27;ve released. Everything works nicely, payment integrations with Stripe and GoCardless, domains through DNSimple, themes are just a set of React Components, so they&#x27;d be easy for people to build. It seems a real shame for it to be sat online, doing very little. I really don&#x27;t want to abandon&#x2F;take it down, because I spent a <i>lot</i> of time building it.<p>Should I try and sell it? Should I just give up? Am I missing something blatantly obvious? If anyone&#x27;s got any advice, broad&#x2F;specific&#x2F;big&#x2F;small, I&#x27;m all ears.<p>If you want to drop me an email, I&#x27;m at hello@benhowdle.im","time":1531737706,"title":"Ask HN: Should I abandon a functioning SaaS with no paying users?","type":"story"},{"by":"subcosmos","descendants":120,"id":17540094,"kids":[17540106,17541000,17540795,17540721,17542981,17542880,17540512,17540805,17541243,17540457,17541794,17540507,17541617,17544623,17541486,17542545,17541392,17547619],"score":340,"time":1531736403,"title":"Alzheimer's risk 10 times lower with herpes medication","type":"story","url":"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322463.php"},{"by":"tdurden","descendants":25,"id":17539969,"kids":[17545982,17549154,17548978,17547064,17546759,17546233],"score":71,"time":1531735065,"title":"To Make Sense of the Present, Brains May Predict the Future","type":"story","url":"https://www.quantamagazine.org/to-make-sense-of-the-present-brains-may-predict-the-future-20180710/"},{"by":"dsr12","descendants":50,"id":17540001,"kids":[17540359,17540409,17540305,17540934,17542785,17540288,17541928,17544091,17540515],"score":103,"time":1531735389,"title":"Scaling: Ethereum’s make or break challenge [video]","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/video/in-conversation-with-vitalik-buterin-justin-drake-and-karl-floersch-ethereum-foundation/"},{"by":"porjo","descendants":109,"id":17539900,"kids":[17540146,17540442,17540062,17540612,17540283,17540197,17540293,17540091,17540277,17540854,17540151,17540084,17541159,17540201],"score":120,"time":1531733998,"title":"Australia's new e-health platform crashes as people rush to opt-out","type":"story","url":"https://www.zdnet.com/google-amp/article/my-health-record-systems-collapse-under-more-opt-outs-than-expected"},{"by":"charlieirish","descendants":1,"id":17539825,"kids":[17546921,17553058],"score":13,"time":1531732830,"title":"How to Design your Resume","type":"story","url":"https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-design-your-resumes-3b86ff7d9f76"},{"by":"duked","descendants":84,"id":17539836,"kids":[17540017,17539846,17539919,17540653,17540024,17540208,17539981,17539960,17539994,17544045,17539992,17540042,17539956],"score":110,"time":1531732986,"title":"British cave diver considering legal action after 'pedo' attack by Elon Musk","type":"story","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/16/british-diver-in-thai-cave-rescue-stunned-after-attack-by-elon-musk"},{"by":"simulate","descendants":20,"id":17539765,"kids":[17549165,17548801,17547581,17548204,17547909,17549235,17550081,17550066],"score":101,"time":1531731932,"title":"How thick is the atmosphere?

I&#x27;ve realized my day to day has almost nothing to do with architecture or programming. It is mostly about problem solving with constraints--creative solutions to bespoke problems (<i>not</i> programming problems). For example, we had a feature that streamed one of our large models to prevent Out Of Memory exceptions, but it was extremely expensive. The goal was to reduce the cost of this feature while maintaining reliability in the service, so no Out Of Memory exceptions. We ended up turning off the feature, deploying a larger machine, which fixed the Out Of Memory exception for most cases, and if it still failed, only then do we initiate the streaming of the resource.<p>I would&#x27;ve never thought of this. My initial plan was to root cause the high memory, which might&#x27;ve been a rabbit hole even if timeboxed, and I don&#x27;t think I would&#x27;ve had a solution at the end. I suppose I was trying to &quot;fix the high memory issue&quot; instead of &quot;reducing cost&quot;, which was what I was <i>actually</i> tasked with doing.<p>My take-a-aways were:\n1.

The third time recruiter contacted me again, I spent months to go over fundamentals&#x2F;algo&#x2F;coding systemically. The feedback turned out to be generally good (two strong hires), but with a mix that my recruiter revealed that my second interviewer, who also delayed my process by two weeks, he gave me the no hire and his feedback was I &quot;needed a lot of hints&quot;?! where he was spending a lot of time asking my experience and leaving me 15 minutes doing the quiz and coding. Worse, he did not give me the opportunity to fix my code the moment I wrote it out! Unfair! While I could not afford to lose the &quot;last&quot; opportunity, but someone like him just destroyed everything! I got rejected by the hiring committee, even though my team match was successful!<p>My girlfriend told me your career is not about stupid google, nor about her. I totally agree with him. However, I felt confused and defeated. I searched online that google is very good at using statistics to judge candidates. So the one No hire is not the only reason, but is it the hiring committee can see all the previous performance before that made the conclusion I was weak, not worth to hire, no matter how many strong hires or recommendation of its own googler? Of course, they don’t cares about how hard you worked. Once a loser, loser forever, in their eyes?<p>The recruiter encouraged me to try in the future. But I think I might have been put in their blacklist or something.

The password is sent over the wire in base64 encoding (which can be easily converted to plaintext).<p>&gt; 2. The password is sent repeatedly, for each request. (Larger attack window)<p>&gt; 3. The password is cached by the webbrowser, at a minimum for the length of the window &#x2F; process. (Can be silently reused by any other request to the server, e.g. CSRF).<p>&gt; 4. The password may be stored permanently in the browser, if the user requests. (Same as previous point, in addition might be stolen by another user on a shared machine).<p>None of his&#x2F;her reasons seem compelling to me though. TLS protects the password on transmit so #1 is no longer a concern. I’m unsure what the attack scenario is with the #2 so I don’t know what a “larger attack window” really entails; MITM, replay attacks... (all of which TLS protects from)? Regarding #3, cookies are also susceptible to CSRF but unlike basic auth, there are methods to protect against that; though I cannot see how CSRF can cause any harm if GET is idempotent as intended (except wasted bandwidth maybe). Lastly, cookies are also stored in the browser for a very long time if the user requests so I don’t think #4 is really valid either.<p>I believe the most concerning&#x2F;valid point of all is #3, and yet I still don’t think it’s something I need to worry about. Am I mistaken? Is there anything else that one should be aware of for the sake of security?<p>Thanks!<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;security.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;990","time":1531376396,"title":"Ask HN: Why isn’t HTTPS and Basic Auth as common as cookies?","type":"story"},{"by":"okket","descendants":2,"id":17512496,"kids":[17512634,17512730],"score":5,"time":1531375425,"title":"Should I Run Postgres on Kubernetes?","type":"story","url":"http://www.databasesoup.com/2018/07/should-i-run-postgres-on-kubernetes.html"},{"by":"curtis","descendants":4,"id":17512293,"kids":[17519173,17533971,17515448],"score":52,"time":1531371646,"title":"The rescue of the crew of the yacht Django (2016)","type":"story","url":"https://boatingnz.co.nz/articles/deep-impact/"},{"by":"curtis","descendants":32,"id":17512419,"kids":[17517156,17516527,17517216,17519317,17516173,17516962,17518194],"score":56,"time":1531373906,"title":"Cassava crisis: the deadly food that doubles as a vital Venezuelan crop (2017)","type":"story","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2017/jun/22/cassava-deadly-food-venezuela"},{"by":"okket","descendants":1,"id":17512313,"kids":[17513737,17512417],"score":1,"time":1531372098,"title":"Why Does Every Soccer Player Do This?","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/10/sports/world-cup/england-croatia-france-belgium.html"},{"by":"prostoalex","descendants":45,"id":17512175,"kids":[17512253,17512282,17512262,17512383,17512450,17512261,17513646,17512255,17512298],"score":25,"time":1531369382,"title":"Tesla CEO Elon Musk vows to 'fix' tainted water in Flint, Michigan","type":"story","url":"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2018/07/11/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-says-he-ready-tackle-contaminated-water-flint-mich/777221002/"},{"by":"evo_9","descendants":232,"id":17512201,"kids":[17514448,17515065,17514008,17512983,17512543,17512531,17512763,17512694,17513466,17513041,17514556,17512911,17512583,17512584,17512992,17512595,17514849,17519773,17514916,17512844,17517253,17532505,17512619,17512690,17512499,17512705,17512546,17512605,17513739,17512778,17512507,17512480,17512559,17512591,17512548,17512925,17514092,17512532,17512539,17513006],"score":308,"time":1531370040,"title":"A biologist who believes that trees speak a language we can learn to listen to","type":"story","url":"https://qz.com/1116991/a-biologist-believes-that-trees-speak-a-language-we-can-learn/"},{"by":"wlrm","descendants":36,"id":17512005,"kids":[17512683,17513242,17512511,17513150,17512430,17512359,17516320,17513121,17515383],"score":104,"time":1531366851,"title":"Neatly Bypassing Content Security Policy","type":"story","url":"https://lab.wallarm.com/how-to-trick-csp-in-letting-you-run-whatever-you-want-73cb5ff428aa"},{"by":"brudgers","descendants":2,"id":17511999,"kids":[17519800,17529793],"score":32,"time":1531366739,"title":"The Carbon Transfer Process (2008)","type":"story","url":"https://unblinkingeye.com/Articles/Carbon/carbon.html"},{"by":"Hernanaracena","descendants":90,"id":17511947,"kids":[17512119,17512038,17512162,17512040,17512121,17512097,17511996,17512214,17512024,17512106,17512013,17512007,17512509,17512237,17512244,17512210,17512043,17511994,17512014,17512182],"score":177,"time":1531365673,"title":"Certified Translator, stuck in Venezuela, looking for remote freelance work","type":"story","url":"http://www.cointotranslate.com/"},{"by":"hiccupingminor","descendants":3,"id":17512108,"kids":[17523591,17525074],"score":33,"time":1531368304,"title":"Teaching Computers Art History","type":"story","url":"http://chrischung.me/2018/06/20/using-a-computer-to-separate-fifteenth-from-seventeenth-century-data/"},{"by":"callmekit","descendants":5,"id":17511901,"kids":[17512837,17514984,17512989],"score":104,"time":1531364907,"title":"Logic programming courses","type":"story","url":"https://edu.swi-prolog.org/"},{"by":"oedmarap","descendants":10,"id":17511732,"kids":[17513840,17517927,17513374],"score":42,"time":1531362258,"title":"Tardigrade protein helps human DNA withstand radiation (2016)","type":"story","url":"https://www.nature.com/news/tardigrade-protein-helps-human-dna-withstand-radiation-1.20648"},{"by":"le-mark","descendants":195,"id":17511850,"kids":[17513389,17512664,17512713,17512642,17512708,17513889,17512902,17512743,17512809,17512868,17513881,17517048,17518395,17512796,17512553,17513698,17512666,17513797,17513496,17513979,17512722,17514235,17517102,17511885,17512948,17513511,17512456,17516396,17522785,17516454,17518503,17513954,17511957,17515265,17521518,17512657,17512712,17513815,17512223,17514804,17516894,17512859,17513065,17517086,17516686,17513510,17518522,17512656,17515080,17516532,17513630,17513847,17514439,17513446,17517264,17513440,17512944,17515610,17514579,17512840,17512896,17514032,17515109,17513640,17513622,17513567,17513114,17515336,17520007,17513327,17512934,17512628,17511856,17514130,17530292,17515335,17521562,17517079,17512841],"score":325,"text":"This is kind of a banal story.

I&#x27;m Saurabh, founder of Synthetic Minds (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;synthetic-minds.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;synthetic-minds.com</a>) in the current YC batch. We protect smart contracts by using formal methods to synthesize their adversaries.<p>Current use of web-app-like development practices for smart contracts is not working. People have lost over 4.1M ETH due to code bugs in these contracts, aka decentralized applications (Dapps). That equals $1.8B at current exchange rates, or $500M at the time of loss. The execution environment is &quot;deploy once, change never&quot;, which resembles hardware and space applications. NASA&#x2F;Airbus use formal methods to check this kind of software. Dapps need similar tools.<p>I have worked on formal methods since 2006. In my PhD on program synthesis, I reduced checking code properties to theorems that could be proven mechanically. Incidentally, a full program was not required. The program could have &quot;holes&quot; and the prover would “fill” the holes by synthesizing code. I took those ideas to synthetic biology in my postdoc and previous company.<p>In 2016 when I started to look at smart contracts, I realized those ideas could help build robust Dapps, and maybe prevent them from losing $100M+&#x2F;year. In June 2016, a Solidity vulnerability was discussed (June 10), but the DAO was deemed immune (June 12), right before it was exploited (June 17), losing ~$150M. In 2017, another ~$300M was lost to the Parity multisig bug. This year, I built a system to help mitigate future failures.<p>The core insight requires some background: Imagine you wrote a lossless compression algorithm `K` (e.g., LZ77 or LZW). Would it not be amazing to synthesize the decompressor `D` automatically? The invariant for `K+D` is the identity function. So if we had a `D` with holes, we could use a prover to verify the identity invariant and “solve for D” simultaneously. Now, what if your `K` was a blockchain smart contract, and `D` an arbitrary user contract? If we want K to be immune to double spends, we could ask for `K+D` that violates the invariant “K’s balance at start &gt;= K’s balance at end”. Not only would we formally verify properties, we would synthesize a specific `D` that helps explain any violations.<p>Here&#x27;s how it works: Our tool has `prove` and `autocode` modes. For a smart contract, `prove` validates its properties while `autocode` will generate user contracts that break it—if any exist. Our servers will aim for turnaround times of minutes allowing use in CI, instead of weeks-long human audits. Two demo screencasts are online: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;synthetic-minds.com&#x2F;pages&#x2F;faq.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;synthetic-minds.com&#x2F;pages&#x2F;faq.html</a>.<p>There are 3 steps under the hood. The 1st step is a source-to-source compiler from Solidity to a shared-memory, non-object, explicit Blockchain-state Intermediate Representation (BIR). BIR is not Solidity specific, so we could compile Ethereum’s Vyper or Tezo’s Liquidity to it, but Solidity’s traction makes it a natural place to start. The 2nd step is a symbolic executor that converts BIR to an “equation”. Think of symbolic execution as execution that traverses <i>every path</i> and <i>without</i> explicit values. E.g., `func a(int x) { y = x + 1; z = y * y; return z; }` would translate to `a(x) = (x + 1).(x + 1)`. Symbolic execution allows us to convert entire programs into an SMT equation. SMT is a theorem proving language used by many automated solvers, e.g., Z3, CVC4. The most novel, 3rd step, augments a user contract with holes for function bodies. That encodes any arbitrary <i>future</i> user contract. The solver can fill holes that (dis)prove combined properties. This simultaneously validates global invariants, and provides readable code if problematic user contracts exist.<p>Formal methods are sometimes hard to use, but it turns out that for smart contracts we can bypass the major issues (false positives, esoteric bugs found, and difficult-to-explain findings). First, most false positives come from inevitable approximations that formal analyses have to make, so they can terminate while analyzing code that itself might not terminate, i.e., Undecidability of analyzing Turing-complete languages. Gas limits truncate executions, which means we get to skip those approximations. Second, when esoteric (weird and obscure) bugs cause failures in normal web services you have to weigh the time and cost of fixing it against the potential loss, which might be negligible. But because smart contracts are immutable, any esoteric code path can be fatal to the entire Dapp, so there is no such tradeoff. Lastly, in contrast with the infinite variability of interfaces for normal web services, the uniformity of blockchain actors provides a template, enabling us to synthesize code as developer-friendly explanations of behavior.<p>Over 12+ years of work, there is one question I have repeatedly asked: Can we trade off human insight at the expense of compute power?  Current alternatives for securing contracts look for 10-20 anti-patterns, built from human insights observing past failures. In contrast, our approach asks for a functional invariant (e.g., no double spend), which might be 100x or more expensive to solve. Compute is cheap though, and our ability to find future failures is only limited by the amount we expend on `autocode`.<p>The first prototype is operational now, and I am sending out beta invites next week: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;synthetic-minds.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;synthetic-minds.com</a>.

Roughly 50% of the services and squads are using metrics and alerts, and this is on-track to becoming 90% until the end of the next quarter.<p>Having a metrics and alerting platform ready to use is making engineers much more confident on their services, but we&#x27;re still facing some incidents that are reported by customer support instead of engineering tools, which could mean either we&#x27;re missing something, or we just have to double down on the rollout to make sure everything is covered and alerting correctly.<p>Could you share your thoughts and experience around observability?","time":1531327417,"title":"Ask HN: What observability effort have had the best impact on your company?","type":"story"},{"by":"sergex","descendants":60,"id":17508151,"kids":[17508178,17515885,17515135,17513036,17515061,17512913,17515203,17512089,17513445,17514020,17516448,17513691,17513489,17519970,17511690,17513441,17513240,17520565,17514743,17514180,17514969,17516633],"score":143,"time":1531326361,"title":"Show HN: Online challenge: Build a CPU from scratch","type":"story","url":"http://nandgame.com/"},{"by":"kjhughes","descendants":2,"id":17508110,"kids":[17509244,17510256],"score":22,"time":1531326137,"title":"Facebook’s Early Days in Palo Alto","type":"story","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/sex-beer-and-coding-inside-facebooks-wild-early-days"},{"by":"Reedx","descendants":34,"id":17508087,"kids":[17509697,17510542,17511575,17511656,17512243,17510965,17510691,17511056,17512465,17515524,17509487],"score":104,"time":1531325971,"title":"The Entire History of Steel","type":"story","url":"https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/a20722505/history-of-steel/"},{"by":"cvaidya1986","descendants":4,"id":17508097,"kids":[17508533,17509421],"score":5,"time":1531326038,"title":"How 20 year old Kylie Jenner built a 900M fortune in 3 years","type":"story","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesdigitalcovers/2018/07/11/how-20-year-old-kylie-jenner-built-a-900-million-fortune-in-less-than-3-years/#9d08962aa62c"},{"by":"SnowingXIV","descendants":9,"id":17508060,"kids":[17510668,17511973,17512563,17514013,17514394,17510469,17517731,17513115],"score":13,"text":"Managing a list of subscribers below 2k is fine though pretty expensive once you exceed 2k.
