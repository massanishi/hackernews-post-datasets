morally wrong is to leave a company and start the same business because you like the business, you think it can be way better and you know that that company will never improve it? What could be the problems? How could I get the customers?<p>The story behind the question, if you are interested:<p>I worked for 2 years for a small company (25 people), in a small team (4&#x2F;5 people, all pretty young, 27&#x2F;33). Basically fresh from college, I was hired as a backend engineer to re-do the backend services (DB, APIs). Lots of decisions were already taken when I joined.<p>These decisions were not great: a lot of architectural choices were done with no rational behind, just by feeling. DB was a mess, no triggers, inconsistent data, zero to null security, and so on. Application layer even worse.<p>What&#x27;s worse is that the dev team was given ALL THE TIME AND SUPPORT from the management to redo everything from scratch, but still made a mess, eg, again, de-normalizing the DB without knowing if it would really be a performance plus, but just because &quot;I feel it would be&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t claim to be the best, but I think that as engineers we should at least try to take decisions based on real things, and not &quot;by feeling&quot; (which I could accept from someone with a lot of experience and recognized in a field).<p>I learned a lot, but lots of things I wanted to do, implement and improve did not get approved. So, at some point my I had enough and left, because I saw that the only things we were doing was trying to fix the mess that was done, and I didn&#x27;t want to go on with that when clearly the whole codebase was so messy that the only solution would be to start over with a real and well defined plan.<p>The service now works somehow (with &quot;duct tape&quot;, as we say) -although there are lots of complaints from customers- so management now is kindof ok with that (because they spend money and time in the redo, so don&#x27;t want to do that again), although they know its shitty (once again).","time":1558532918,"title":"Ask HN: Starting same business of the company I left?","type":"story"},{"by":"bluedino","descendants":16,"id":19981046,"kids":[19981354,19982218,19982110,19981536,19981749,19981532,19981751,19986357,19981586],"score":31,"time":1558532542,"title":"The US reportedly considering blacklisting Chinese surveillance firm Hikvision","type":"story","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/22/us-reportedly-considering-blacklisting-chinas-hikvision.html"},{"by":"abedef","descendants":2,"id":19981035,"kids":[19983838,19981065],"score":3,"text":"I try to always keep security in mind when working on my side projects, but can&#x27;t shake the feeling that I am obliviously committing grave mistakes.<p>What are some of your favorite resources for trustworthy general-purpose security best practices?<p>To clarify, I am looking to better understand appropriate practices for things like password hashing &amp; storage and authentication token generation, and considerations that should be taken when running a web server.

Currently I am passing ~15 arguments to _main.

I can create an object by using parameters from CLI or JSON as required and pass this object to _main.<p>The downside is that _main is called only at one place.

been very dilemmatic about my current career situation and I’m hoping I can get some advice from the people here at HN.<p>I&#x27;ve joined my current company 3years ago as a web developer. By the end of my first year with the company, they decided to offshore most of their technical work. I was subsequently promoted to be the project manager to manage the offshore vendors.<p>On paper, I’m currently a project manager. But I&#x27;m really just a middleman between the internal users and the offshore vendors. On average, I only spend about 3 hours a day sending emails to vendors. I usually spend the rest of the hours doing my own things.<p>I&#x27;ve lots of freedom at managing my time too! Because I can have long lunch breaks, I&#x27;ve recently started moonlighting through a freelance assignment to teach programming during lunch time at places within 30mins distance from my office. It&#x27;s crazy how I get to do my own things during office hours while still getting paid! I literally have zero stress and I’m so happy every day. It doesn’t feel like a job at all!<p>However, lately, I’ve started to worry if this is going to hurt my technical career in the long run. I&#x27;m pretty sure my current job has nothing great to boast about at interviews when I&#x27;ve to move on to a new job. Although I still continue to learn newer tech on my own such as React, Angular, etc, it&#x27;s worrying to wonder how much of these counts as real experiences when I really need to find a new job.<p>A part of me feels my current job is a rare find and I can&#x27;t bear to just walk away. It feels silly to find a more demanding job just for “work experiences” when I can earn additional income through freelance gigs during office hours!<p>But another part of me is also telling myself I should leave this job asap for the long-term good.<p>Has anyone been through a job like this before? What path did you take and how did things turn out?

Set up a first computer with a neural network that 1) takes as input the audio and video output from a second computer (including a microphone input) and 2) outputs keyboard and mouse commands to the second computer.<p>2 Train the first computer neural network to operate the second computer like a human operator in response to instructions (voice commands) from a human controller (i.e., the first computer neural network being the operator of the second computer and the human controller giving instructions to the neural network operator).<p>3 The neural network may be similar to the Openai Five network [1] with CNNs plus embedding and FC layers at the audio and video inputs that feed into a long LSTM layer that feeds into FC layers for the keyboard and mouse outputs.<p>4 The &quot;reward&quot; for the neural network is something like a laptop battery life meter that drains over time as the neural network operates the second computer and gets refilled at the whim of the human operator, e.g., after the successful completion of commands. Eventually, with a large enough network and enough compute, the commands transition from &quot;open this&quot; and &quot;do that&quot; to &quot;what will happen next?&quot; and &quot;how does that make you feel?&quot;. Sessions using human operators can be recorded and replayed for the neural networks to begin learning and then graduate to live interaction with a human controller.<p>5 If emotions, intelligence, and consciousness are emergent properties, then those properties should emerge from the neural network behavior.<p>6 If consciousness is not emergent, then the neural network may still be trained to operate a computer.

I have been aggregating a weekly list(http:&#x2F;&#x2F;houston.substack.com) of interesting problems that people have shared that if solved might turn into great businesses. A couple of interesting things have repeatedly come up and I thought HN might find them interesting. Here&#x27;s what seem to have resonated the most with people:<p><i>1. I wish the startup I work at allowed me to choose my own perks</i><p>&quot;A lot of the office perks I get at work are kind of useless. I wish that I could choose my own perks like free Spotify and Netflix rather than some obscure &#x27;wellness benefit&#x27; that I have to remember to expense to get a reimbursement.&quot;<p><i>2. There&#x27;s no good software for managing a campaign and running for office.</i><p>If you&#x27;re someone young like Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, it&#x27;s hard to figure out how to run for office and manage a campaign. NationBuilder is the legacy player in the space you can tell it&#x27;s not a mobile or video native product (doesn&#x27;t natively support YouTube, Insta, Snapchat, etc.). Another problem is that this software costs some real money so playing around with the business model might unlock substantial value (e.g., charge a % of $ raised).<p><i>3. A dedicated social network for memes is something that doesn&#x27;t exist</i><p>My Instagram is now a basically feed of memes but Instagram itself was not built for this purpose. It’s impossible to create memes on Instagram so creators use other tools, import them to Insta and do a similar process for people that send them memes to upload to their accounts. I think 9gag might have been too early to the game but right now feels like the perfect time.<p><i>4. We need a way to process cannabis payments! Processing cannabis payments is too bureaucratic</i><p>&quot;I just found out that Stripe will not process CBD payments. I love Stripe, and sure there are many reasons this is the case. But doesn’t this seem crazy in 2019? I can buy CBD products at almost every corner store in Los Angeles, including CVS and Walgreens.&quot;","time":1557959312,"title":"Problems that people have that can be turned into meaningful businesses","type":"story"},{"by":"naveen99","descendants":9,"id":19924381,"kids":[19924932,19939014,19924401],"score":4,"time":1557959109,"title":"Why don't startups list valuations along with funding amounts to the press?","type":"story"},{"by":"tosh","descendants":2,"id":19924272,"kids":[19924590,19925831],"score":8,"time":1557958194,"title":"Bristol academic cracks Voynich code","type":"story","url":"https://m.phys.org/news/2019-05-bristol-academic-voynich-code-century-old.html"},{"by":"ccdev","descendants":2,"id":19924099,"kids":[19924437,19924171],"score":1,"text":"A mention of Chinese-made developer frameworks was brought up in a different website&#x27;s discussion, so that got me curious to ask this question.

be sharing it with you all.<p>Guestboard keeps all your big group events under one roof, and includes a growing number of optional widgets to help your event, currently:<p>• A Central message board (forum)<p>• Shared resources (to post important links like GDocs, lineup posters, etc)<p>• Airbnb map<p>• Timeline&#x2F;Schedule<p>• Interactive checklist (my favorite)<p>• Parter Deals (so you can save money on goods and services related to your specific event type)<p>Important note: We know, and an iOS AND Android app is currently cooking in the background. :)<p>------<p>A little backstory, for those who want to read more:<p>Out of personal frustration, we began with the mission of  allowing WEDDING GUESTS to see who else is going, and be able to plan carpools, share flight deals, and more. (b&#x2F;c weddings are stupid expensive for the guests, too)<p>But we quickly saw that our beta users were using it for OTHER group events that required a bit more organization rather than &quot;just showing up&quot;..<p>..events like bachelor&#x2F;bachelorette parties, camping for a music festival, group vacations, and small retreats&#x2F;conferences.<p>As a couple of 30-year-olds, we remember how FB events USED to be used - a place to invite and plan events with your real friends. But FB events has quickly become a mess of invitations from local businesses trying to drum up ticket sales.<p>Meetup.com didn&#x27;t make sense, eventbrite.com seemed more appropriate for charging admission, and ultimately, we saw a general shift to reverting back to massive email chains or group texts..<p>.And we hate 20-person group texts.<p>There&#x27;s still much to do, but really looking forward to your feedback and thoughts.

Is there a way to spin this into something positive?<p>I would love to hear if anyone else has gone through what I described and managed to move into a different role, and how you managed to spin your situation and emphasise the positives.","time":1557768770,"title":"Ask HN: Have you moved to a less technical role after failing as a developer?","type":"story"},{"by":"Thorondor","descendants":49,"id":19901431,"kids":[19901712,19902608,19902830,19904410,19903814,19901733,19901654,19903751,19905117,19906815,19905136,19905644,19906577,19902389,19904435],"score":384,"time":1557767907,"title":"Stack Overflow lets Facebook track users across their sites","type":"story","url":"https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/384864/stack-overflow-lets-facebook-track-us-across-their-sites?cb=1"},{"by":"lelf","descendants":4,"id":19901386,"kids":[19906605,19902224],"score":6,"time":1557767584,"title":"Common food additive E171 found to affect gut microbiota","type":"story","url":"https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-05-common-food-additive-e171-affect.html"},{"by":"AndrewBissell","descendants":162,"id":19901362,"kids":[19901703,19902772,19902903,19903888,19902732,19901987,19901927,19905801,19901804,19901974,19901546,19901681,19902009,19904006,19901519,19907351,19903478,19907370,19902397,19901629,19901863,19903336,19901914],"score":110,"time":1557767462,"title":"Uber's Losses Reach Double Digits in IPO Debut","type":"story","url":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uber-shares-decline-second-day-091656484.html"},{"by":"tshannon","descendants":133,"id":19901318,"kids":[19902273,19901677,19902544,19902334,19901929,19901708,19908284,19906926,19904075,19908630,19902453,19902228,19902061,19902517,19901901],"score":105,"time":1557767255,"title":"The sci-fi cities of Bezos’s Blue Origin derive from his teacher Gerard O’Neill","type":"story","url":"https://www.citylab.com/perspective/2019/05/space-colony-design-jeff-bezos-blue-origin-oneill-colonies/589294/"},{"by":"callumlocke","descendants":4,"id":19901175,"kids":[19916320,19919850],"score":61,"time":1557766443,"title":"What interactives can do that articles can’t (2018)","type":"story","url":"https://ejb.github.io/2018/06/03/interactives.html"},{"by":"codesternews","descendants":83,"id":19901196,"kids":[19902331,19901815,19901515,19901919,19901575,19901780,19902248,19901631,19902063,19902264,19901607,19916951],"score":51,"time":1557766542,"title":"Amazon to employees: Quit your job, we’ll help you start a delivery business","type":"story","url":"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/05/amazon-to-employees-quit-your-job-well-help-you-start-a-delivery-business/"},{"by":"rvnx","descendants":35,"id":19900808,"kids":[19906161,19907237,19906157,19906104,19904785,19905780,19907385,19910235,19907393],"score":54,"time":1557764401,"title":"DNS over SMS, send a text message to 1(833)672-1001","type":"story","url":"https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/fun-stuff/dns-over-sms/"},{"by":"jseliger","descendants":47,"id":19900807,"kids":[19901410,19901200,19901130,19901381,19901165,19901124,19901467,19901768,19901945,19901348,19901091,19901291,19901342,19901371],"score":78,"time":1557764400,"title":"Journalists Are Reporting Their Colleagues to HR for Political Opinions","type":"story","url":"https://jessesingal.substack.com/p/journalists-are-reporting-their-colleagues"},{"by":"nathanasmith","descendants":401,"id":19900955,"kids":[19901740,19901559,19905658,19902291,19901468,19902590,19904070,19901591,19901907,19902332,19902838,19906381,19904622,19903658,19905017,19903836,19901818,19903281,19904755,19903675,19905201,19904579,19902094,19903512,19901553,19904342,19901501,19903093,19903602,19907433,19902265,19902004,19902054,19902359,19901989,19902391,19901543,19903403,19910128,19901912,19904320,19913833,19901937,19903707,19901504,19902687,19901808,19903990,19904987,19903016,19904758,19908191,19904322,19902798,19906225,19906456,19904576,19906285,19904242,19906956,19902619,19901859,19906510,19904359,19902733,19904458,19903899,19903203,19905000,19902177,19941734,19906480,19904989,19903200,19907043,19904411,19901428,19905096,19905937,19909482,19902018,19905067,19902920,19902282,19902222,19904347,19905098,19904951,19907508,19901790,19904545,19907936,19907015,19904593,19904401,19911370,19903172,19905091,19904263,19907244,19904699,19906264,19902067,19908416,19901058,19906586,19904975,19904396,19901963],"score":927,"text":"15 years ago I learned Python by studying some O&#x27;Reilly books and I have been a hobbyist programmer ever since.<p>The books went into detail and since reading them I&#x27;ve felt confident writing scripts I needed to scratch an itch. Over time, I grew comfortable believing I had a strong grasp of the practical details and anything I hadn&#x27;t seen was likely either minor quibble, domain specific, or impractically theoretic.<p>This was until last year when I started working on a trading bot. I felt there should be two distinct parts to the bot, one script getting data then passing that data along to the other script for action. This seemed correct as later I might want multiple scripts serving both roles and passing data all around. Realizing the scripts would need to communicate over a network with minimal latency, I considered named pipes, Unix domain sockets, even writing files to &#x2F;dev&#x2F;shm but none of these solutions really fit.<p>Googling, I encountered something I hadn&#x27;t heard of called a message queue. More specifically, the ZMQ messaging library. Seeing some examples I realized this was important. The step of then plowing through the docs was nothing short of revelatory. Every next chapter introduced another brilliant pattern. While grokking Pub&#x2F;Sub, Req&#x2F;Res, Push&#x2F;Pull and the rest I couldn&#x27;t help breaking away, staring in space, struck by how this new thing I had just read could have deftly solved some fiendish memorable problem I&#x27;d previously struggled against.<p>Later, I pondered the meaning of only now stumbling on something so powerful, so fundamental, so hidden in plain sight, as messaging middleware?

I struggled through the whole university too. I understood and learned almost everything at home for 5 years. Sometimes I even got asleep during important classes. I&#x27;m not talking about 1.5 hour long scrum groomings or reviews, sometimes I can&#x27;t even pay attention during a 15 minute long standup in the morning.

I am a 28 year old developer working in New York at one of the big tech companies for the last several years. Lately I am finding myself burnt out and in poor health both physically and mentally and all around miserable. I have lost joy in a lot of things in life including the work. I recognized work being a key thing contributing to this and made the decision to quit my job, take 2-3 months off just mentally recovering and improving my physical health and then finding a new job at another company- likely a startup instead of another megacorp.<p>I have enough money saved up that I could afford to not do anything for many years and live off my savings if I wanted. I am single with no house, no kids or responsibilities and a simple lifestyle, the most expensive thing I own is my $2500 desktop.<p>However as I get closer to handing in my resignation the more self-doubt is creeping in. The thing is this job pays incredibly well and I feel guilty quitting it to take an extended break without having anything lined up. Another thing is that I have been working basically non-stop since I was 16-17 so the idea of taking 2-3 months off for myself is also making me feel bad and guilty. Moreover I see people who are much worse off then me who continue to grind and that makes me feel even more guilty for doing this.<p>I imagine there are many here who might have been in similar situations and can share their story and offer advice.

You would be required to take a short training class before having one and be licensed and registered. It would use some combination of non-lethal weaponry (stun dart, gas round) and use a smart targeting system where it basically works like a camera and it&#x27;s point and fire. The target would be &quot;painted&quot; and the the device would figure out the best trajectory to the target. So in the heat of the moment a non-combat trained person would have an easier time using it. After the round is fired and the target is unconscious, the police would be notified and a picture of the target sent to them as well as the GPS coordinates of the device. I imagine if something like this was even integrated into cellphones or something it could become extremely widespread and everyone would have a method to protect themselves that didn&#x27;t rely on guns alone. I think if adoption rate was high enough then these shootings would become less frequent.<p>I just wanted to share this idea.

I would like to argue the reason articles have titles usually in the form of a question is mainly because of the laziness of the author. I want HN&#x27;s feedback on this hence me posting this here.<p>If you think about it there is no reason for a title of an article to be a question. A question is typically directed toward a person who can answer that question. If a question is asked without the expectation of an answer why is it in the form of a question? (I just did that here by the way.) To raise curiosity could be one reason, but there is no one having a dialog so it seems wrong to me that a question is asked when in fact an assertion should be made.<p>Part of the reason I believe for why this is happening is because it may be fashionable to pose a question instead of making an assertion because it&#x27;s indicative of not making assumptions and having an open mind. However, articles do make assumptions constantly and are in fact loaded with biases both unintentionally and on purpose. They try to persuade us by highlighting the information that is supportive of their final conclusion and omitting others that are not so much.<p>Finally the reasons may not be so nefarious as the picture I painted above, but perhaps at best just laziness.<p>Please let me know if this is what you think too or why I&#x27;m making a mistake.","time":1557364729,"title":"Ask HN: Why post titles are created as a question?","type":"story"},{"by":"nreece","descendants":3,"id":19864368,"kids":[19865206,19864630],"score":18,"time":1557363054,"title":"Adam Savage on Lists, More Lists, and the Power of Checkboxes","type":"story","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/adam-savage-lists-more-lists-power-checkboxes/"},{"by":"jeffbarr","descendants":135,"id":19864351,"kids":[19864536,19864709,19865135,19864611,19865047,19864909,19864549,19864782,19870959,19866949,19864849,19864569,19865222,19865808,19865309,19868686,19869742,19864575,19866485,19869613,19866669,19866663,19864869],"score":604,"time":1557362823,"title":"Amazon S3 Path Deprecation Plan – The Rest of the Story","type":"story","url":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-path-deprecation-plan-the-rest-of-the-story/"},{"by":"ohjeez","descendants":3,"id":19864309,"kids":[19864545,19864551],"score":3,"time":1557362316,"title":"Brain scans reveal a ‘pokémon region’ in adults who played as kids","type":"story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18531287/pokemon-neuroscience-visual-cortex-brain-information"},{"by":"rmason","descendants":54,"id":19864169,"kids":[19866073,19865611,19866672,19865338,19865870,19866230,19866616,19864541,19864431],"score":80,"time":1557360455,"title":"On the Trail of the RoboCall King","type":"story","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/on-the-trail-of-the-robocall-king/"},{"by":"bullcitydev","descendants":16,"id":19864197,"kids":[19866224,19866013,19927116,19866096,19866717,19867083,19869223],"score":59,"time":1557360885,"title":"Show HN: Flipt – an open-source feature flag solution","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/markphelps/flipt"},{"by":"newman8r","descendants":145,"id":19864189,"kids":[19866308,19865535,19864843,19865150,19864880,19865208,19864696,19865378,19864687,19864848,19869823,19867333,19865092,19865435],"score":323,"time":1557360740,"title":"United Nations Expert Arrested in Tunisia for Using an RTL-SDR","type":"story","url":"https://www.rtl-sdr.com/united-nations-expert-arrested-in-tunisia-for-using-an-rtl-sdr/"},{"by":"pepys","descendants":18,"id":19864148,"kids":[19891466,19891418,19891097,19956833,19892550,19892212,19892285,19892331,19892245],"score":58,"time":1557360256,"title":"The Great Hanoi Rat Massacre of 1902 Did Not Go as Planned (2017)","type":"story","url":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/hanoi-rat-massacre-1902"},{"by":"Kinnard","descendants":5,"id":19864039,"kids":[19867157,19877028],"score":5,"text":"What are some great stack programming resources?","time":1557359045,"title":"Ask HN: Stack Programming Resources?","type":"story"},{"by":"scarface74","descendants":2,"id":19863989,"kids":[19864389,19864608],"score":3,"time":1557358515,"title":"The Problem with Banning Plastic Bags","type":"story","url":"https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2019/04/09/711181385/are-plastic-bag-bans-garbage"},{"by":"chmaynard","descendants":184,"id":19863871,"kids":[19864505,19864437,19864844,19865165,19866034,19865647,19865791,19864432,19867772,19868169,19864863,19864729,19864795,19865409,19867531,19869118,19865478,19864496,19869944,19864990,19865836,19866235,19874328,19864749,19869581,19866337,19866199,19866924,19866331,19866374,19865473,19869072,19870771],"score":273,"time":1557357509,"title":"Inheritance versus Composition","type":"story","url":"https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/787800/b7f5351b3a41421a/"},{"by":"furcyd","descendants":161,"id":19863887,"kids":[19867635,19867369,19868399,19867332,19866597,19866048,19866907,19867383,19867261,19866935,19866070,19865803,19866864,19867906],"score":197,"time":1557357652,"title":"Training the Brain to Eat Less Sugar","type":"story","url":"https://drexel.edu/now/archive/2019/May/brain-train-diet-game/"},{"by":"selimonder","descendants":28,"id":19863913,"kids":[19865397,19866069,19865810,19868990,19870846,19890908],"score":76,"time":1557357815,"title":"Adversarial Examples Are Not Bugs, They Are Features","type":"story","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02175"},{"by":"b0rsuk","descendants":16,"id":19863818,"kids":[19865216,19864276,19866995,19877974,19889898,19876386,19876192],"score":8,"text":"Today our boss came up with a &quot;reorganization&quot; to &quot;improve efficiency&quot;.

I’m Rob, Founder of Prometheus. We’re removing CO2 from the air and turning it gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Since we use zero-carbon electricity from sources like solar and wind to make our fuel, there are no net CO2 emissions when you use it.<p>An article about us came up on HN recently and people seemed interested (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19792412\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19792412</a>), so we thought it would be good to try to answer some of the questions we saw there and try to dive in some more to any questions that follow!<p>The only inputs to make the fuel are CO2 and water (both from the air) and electricity. The only outputs are fuel and oxygen. One way to think about it is that making fuel is reverse combustion. The process isn’t super efficient (we expect 50-60% overall efficiency at maturity), but it turns out that doesn’t matter as long as the electricity is zero carbon and low cost. If the cost of our equipment is also low,  then we believe we can not only make zero carbon fuel, but actually compete on price with fossil fuel.<p>We’re not the first to make fuel from the air - in fact Google, Audi, Carbon Engineering, Global Thermostat, Climeworks, and labs at universities and national labs have all done it before us. What no one has been able to do so far is do it at a low enough cost to compete with fossil fuel.<p>The thing that’s new about what we’re doing is that we have gotten rid of all the thermal processes normally used, and instead use a process that uses only electricity (no natural gas, etc) and does it at room temperature. This is a big deal for both capital cost and for being truly carbon zero. We can use inexpensive materials, which keeps our cost low, and can start up and shut down quickly, which allows us to run intermittently, matching the intermittent nature of many renewable energy sources. We can also only run when the power is at the price we want.<p>Digging in to some more details, we absorb CO2 and water vapor from the air into an aqueous electrolyte. We then react the CO2 in the water with a copper catalyst to directly make alcohols like ethanol, butanol, propanol, etc. Both of these things have been done by many others and the science is known. Normally at this point one would have to use a thermal process (distillation) to get the fuel out of the water, and this is expensive and makes the economics really hard to get right. We don’t have to do this step thermally though, because we have a carbon nanotube membrane that replaces it, extracting the alcohols from water in a single step at room temperature. This makes a huge difference in cost. The last step is that we up-convert the alcohols to gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. This last step is also well known and we can actually buy this step from others.<p>The carbon nanotube membrane that makes this all work is the product of 6 years at my previous startup, Mattershift. I was developing it for desalination and water purification. About 3 years ago I realized it could do this job, but it wasn’t clear that a startup could raise money for such an ambitious effort, especially one linked to a political issue (unfortunately) like climate change. When I saw the YC request for startups in carbon removal, I knew that the timing was right, and I founded Prometheus to do it.<p>Please let me know if you have more questions or feedback. I’ll do my best to answer any questions, but please excuse if I’m not able to go too far into details like our piping and instrumentation design, or other really specific things we wouldn’t want to help competitors with.<p>Thanks!","time":1557166918,"title":"Launch HN: Prometheus (YC W19) – Remove CO2 from Air and Turn It into Gasoline","type":"story"},{"by":"fniephaus","descendants":14,"id":19842238,"kids":[19843863,19842892,19844088,19843940,19843897],"score":53,"time":1557166908,"title":"Alan Kay on “What Made APL Programming So Revolutionary?”","type":"story","url":"https://www.quora.com/What-made-APL-programming-so-revolutionary?share=1"},{"by":"howard941","descendants":2,"id":19842179,"kids":[19842264,19842210],"score":3,"time":1557166579,"title":"A 30-MPH e-bike to compete with cars in cities?

After about a week I realized I hated it. Weird company culture, bad micromanager, disgusting codebase, no WFH. It&#x27;s not terrible but there are certainly better jobs out there. I decided to stay; the pay is decent and I had a lot to learn (about being professional, office politics, marketing, knowing when you have PMF, sales, branding, stock options, <i></i>NOT<i></i> engineering). Just for a year though. Then I was gonna switch to another, better job.<p>What I didn&#x27;t anticipate was being incredibly burnt out. I want to quit and not work for a while. Issue is I heard that&#x27;s &quot;bad&quot; around the Internet.<p>Here&#x27;s what I have going for me:<p>* I can live with my parents at any time for as long as I want no questions asked.<p>* About 10 months in I started getting regular pings (2x per week) via email&#x2F;LinkedIn from recruiters for various other jobs, varying from startups to Uber&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;Google.<p>* I have been shipping production-quality software since 2007. Based on my experience at this startup I believe I have the equivalent of 8 YoE but that&#x27;s hard to put on paper.<p>* I have friends at various other companies that could refer me.<p>Basically my career goal is to bootstrap a SaaS company and either turn it into a lifestyle business or get acquired for like $1-5M. The job market is a backup plan for me. I&#x27;ve had 2 engineering jobs at this point and I fucking hated both of them.<p>Will this recruiter outreach stop once I quit? I&#x27;m also kinda worried about closing the door to Google&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;Uber but honestly I&#x27;d rather work somewhere that let me work part time remote so I could focus on my own stuff.

They sent me information regarding a debt that I dispute, and legally in the US I have a 30 day window to dispute the debt in writing via certified mail, which I did. However, they cleverly put a fake date on their initial letter to me, to narrow the date in which I could dispute it. I.e. they wrote me a letter about the debt on February 25th, but put a fake date of February 1st on the letter- thus only giving me until March 1st to respond within the 30 day window. They now state that my certified letter to them was outside of that 30 days. I cannot think of any way of proving when I actually physically received the letter, so their fraudulent &#x27;date&#x27; on the notice made it impossible for me to respond in time.<p>Yes I am familiar with credit repair agencies and some of my federal rights, but- I was planning on purchasing a property this year, and their fraud likely makes that impossible. Even if I eventually have it removed, it will be months or years too late. And no simply paying the debt isn&#x27;t worth it now, as my credit report would still show an account that had been in collections very recently.<p>I know this is not the right place for legal advice, but I am considering aggressive &amp; punitive litigation. It&#x27;s rational for me to spend significant money on a litigator, as it&#x27;s still likely less than what I&#x27;d pay in a higher interest rate over 30 years due to worse credit.

I&#x27;m aiming at something a lot like Excel in that respect, except focused on symbolic data like personnel sheets, instead of primarily numeric data. One of the important ways that I try to make this &quot;smooth&quot; learning curve is by providing what I&#x27;m trying to make a very powerful and intuitive GUI and also by having a natural language interface to the logic programming engine. So far, the NL interface can allow simple rules to be written without a lot of domain and syntax knowledge. So far this NL interface isn&#x27;t very smart, but hopefully, I&#x27;ll be able to make it ready to deal with fairly sophisticated rules in the future.<p>Since I&#x27;m still in high school, I have honestly no experience with actually making good software that people can use, so any suggestions on usability, documentation, interface or program design would be more than welcome!

Bars, theaters, barbershops, can use Withfriends to convert their customers to become monthly-paying members. Members receive simple &amp; automated benefits, and small businesses earn additional revenue.<p>We’ve started by focusing on music venues and event organizers. All three of us come from a lifetime of organizing events, primarily in NYC. Joe and Kunal started a music venue and collective art space in Brooklyn, called The Silent Barn. Kunal started one of the first video game galleries, called Babycastles. Martha and Joe used to run a newsprint listing called Showpaper, which aggregated shows from hundreds of venues every week. We know that culture in cities is defined by the beloved small businesses around us, we know how cultural funding works and where it falls short. With our own businesses, we saw that by changing how we asked for support, we could radically change the volume of people funding our venues, and by automating member benefits, it was easy to facilitate them. After testing an early iteration of the product with a handful of organizers, we decided to bring these insights to a larger audience as Withfriends.<p>How does it work? We found that people are most willing to purchase a membership when asked in the checkout flow, with their credit card already out. Instead of asking business owners to promote memberships as an entirely new product, we integrate with the point of sale to sell memberships as an add on to any purchase.  This makes selling memberships as easy as selling tickets for any small business, so they can start today. Withfriends uses point-of-sale APIs to make this possible, and automates member benefits directly in the POS, like presale and discounts. Any business can write in custom member benefits in addition to Withfriends benefits, but we have data from over 100,000 purchases to date on the platform, so we start each business with a proven set of membership tiers and benefits specific to their business as soon as they sign up. We’re taking infrastructure that has been proven by large institutions like museums, and making it accessible to any small business organizer anywhere, whether they have a staff of 50 or only 1.<p>We already are working with over 85 small businesses around the country, and have 5500 members supporting them. We&#x27;ve generated an average of 40% additional revenue for our businesses.  We’re making $6k in MRR, and our membership revenue is growing 30% month over month.<p>Much of our initial traction last year was from our own networks, relying on an invite-only approach to new sign-ups, and we activated each and every membership program by hand. This taught us a lot, but since joining Y Combinator we’ve been focused on preparing for the public by automating the setup flow. Now anyone can become an organizer on Withfriends in minutes, and start growing their members with every upcoming event. This has allowed us to jump from 7 small business sign-ups per month before Y Combinator to over 70.<p>When we began, we took a 5% fee of the membership revenue, and charged ~$1 per ticket when an organizer uses our native ticketing. That pricing is the same as other ticketing or fundraising platforms, but none of them offer businesses the 40% revenue boost that Withfriends creates for our customers. Since then, we&#x27;ve built an integration with Eventbrite that allows organizers on Eventbrite to easily sell memberships too - in that case, we only earn membership fees. We believe memberships are our strength, so we&#x27;re testing new pricing that focuses on membership revenue entirely. By making memberships for small businesses easy and successful, we’re thrilled to help them grow and become more  sustainable.<p>It’s an honor to be able to share this idea with the Hacker News community and we’d love to hear what you all think.

We are Erik, Zach, and Tom, the founders of Centaur Labs (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;centaurlabs.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;centaurlabs.io</a>). We’ve built a platform where doctors, other medical professionals, and med students label medical images, improving datasets for AI.<p>The idea grew out of Erik’s research when he was a PhD student at MIT’s Center for Collective Intelligence. In short, he found that by aggregating the opinions of multiple people--even including some people with little or no medical expertise--they could reliably distinguish cancerous moles from benign ones better than individual dermatologists.<p>The three of us have been friends since we were undergrads. When we would chat about Erik’s research, it seemed like a no-brainer that there’d be demand for more accurate diagnoses. We all had our frustrations that as patients, you usually have to trust one doctor’s opinion.<p>So we built a mobile app called DiagnosUs where users around the world analyze medical images and videos. Many are doctors who simply enjoy looking at cases or want to improve their skills. Other users like competing with their peers, seeing themselves on our leader boards, and winning cash prizes in our competitions.<p>Different people (and algorithms) have different skills. Using data on how our users perform on cases with “gold standard” answers, we train a machine-learning model to identify how differently-skilled people complement each other and cover each other’s blind spots. The more we learn about our users’ skills and expertise, the better we get at aggregating their opinions. It is a bit like putting together the optimal trivia team: you don’t just need the five best people, you need someone who is good at pop culture, someone who knows sports, etc. Experts trained in the same way often have the same blind spots, so outcomes improve when you include a range of opinions.<p>We initially thought we’d go straight to providing opinions on demand for consumers like ourselves. There aren’t nearly enough doctors to meet the demand around the world to have everyone’s medical images analyzed. But it didn’t take long to realize that our fledgling startup wasn’t yet prepared to deal with the regulatory issues that would entail.<p>Meanwhile, we’d been hearing for years that AI was on the verge of replacing radiology, but it seemed like the hype didn’t match the reality. Many companies trying to develop medical AI are impeded by bad data. They try to hire doctors to go through thousands or millions of images and re-label them, but this has proven hard for them to manage and scale.<p>Our customers have giant medical datasets and want to use them to train AI. But the quality of the data holds them back, and they can’t find nearly enough doctors to label the data accurately. Our platform provides a high volume of labels quickly, and our performance analytics enables us to get highly accurate labels from groups of people with a range of skills.<p>We’d love to hear from anyone working on medical AI who’s faced the challenge of dealing with flawed datasets. If you’re interested in trying our app, you can download DiagnosUs for iOS in the App Store.

I think that is a shame because WiFi networks are essentially a bunch of existing micro-communities which your phone already automatically connects to. Think about how many other people have used or will use the same WiFi as you at home, school, work, or in public; and so far it has been practically impossible to chat or share pictures with them.<p>After leaving my job earlier this year, I decided to work on a simple chat app that solves this problem, by simply opening a <i>persistent</i> group chat for every WiFi you connect to, which allows for long-lasting conversations and meaningful relationships everywhere you go. So far a great use case I&#x27;ve seen are college campuses where thousands of students connect to the same WiFi, and who can now all chat with each other. I&#x27;d love to see what else this can or will be used for.<p>(Spoiler alert: the app doesn’t bother with mesh networks)<p>Feedback is much appreciated!

I&#x27;ve been working for the past ~5 years at a fortune 500 company, and have switched my positions a few times (generally advancing my tech skills, so think tech support -&gt; QE -&gt; software engineer type of a thing).<p>It has happened to me multiple times that I came to work and if I simply read a book the whole time, nobody would notice. So, I&#x27;d desperately try to find some work for me in each of my positions. Paradoxically, that would make me stand out, because I&#x27;d be extremely receptive to PR reviews and collaborative processes, which would be a huge factor in the promotion process. At the same time, I dislike this feeling of &#x27;all jiras done, what now?&#x27;, and so the fact that a position had prolonged periods of it was the major, deciding factor in me abandoning it.<p>I thought, until recently, that this was mainly a &#x27;me&#x27; thing, i.e. I&#x27;m too green to actively look for work even when none is given. You know, these people that always have a ton of ideas, and the only thing you have to do is manage their priority. I&#x27;m not that, and so I&#x27;ve been kind of hard on myself for not being creative enough to see what needs to be done without being explicitly told.<p>That said, my wife recently joined a new company, and was complaining at home that she had 0 things to do. They hired her, and now, she&#x27;s sitting there re-reading documentation, managers scrambling to give her some tasks. She&#x27;s also at a fortune 500 company. She also mentioned that her fellow new hires said the same thing.<p>I&#x27;m now beginning to wonder, is this a common thing? How do you deal with these periods?

Rahul later completed a Master&#x27;s in Robotics at the University of Toronto and I&#x27;ve done my MBA at Rotman.<p>We started this a few years ago when I (Manmeet) found out that my nephew, Praneit, has Cerebral Palsy, and that he would not be able to walk. Not walking can lead to contractures, hip subluxation, and many physiological and psychological issues for kids. We wanted to change that. We decided to use our robotics background, along with help from friends and the top rehabilitation researchers in North America, and in 2016,  watched my nephew take his first steps using our device. Watching Praneit walk is definitely the proudest moment of my life, and we realized that there are families all over the world that can benefit from this, so we started Trexo Robotics.<p>The Trexo device is available for $899 per month (via financing) or can be purchased outright for $29,900. \nIt is an exercise and therapy tool, allowing children to get the benefits of daily walking at their homes. We decided to design it so that it attaches onto an existing walker. Currently, it only works with Rifton&#x27;s Dynamic Pacer, but hopefully, we can add other walkers later on as well. Our controller allows you to modify the gait pattern to adapt to the needs of different kids and adjust the amount of force&#x2F;assistance that the robot provides on each joint.\nWe are already launched, with kids using it to walk thousands of steps daily. It has been amazing to see the interest of families.\nOur device is available for pre-order. Our 2019 production is already fully reserved, and we are now taking reservations for next year.<p>Really interested to hear the HN community&#x27;s thoughts on our approach, and experiences families or others have had in this space.","time":1556556971,"title":"Launch HN: Trexo Robotics (YC W19) – Robotic Legs for Kids with Cerebral Palsy","type":"story"},{"by":"magtux","descendants":64,"id":19780032,"kids":[19781100,19780618,19780801,19781023,19780580,19780749,19781121,19780204,19780372,19780937,19781323],"score":91,"time":1556556474,"title":"Boeing waited until after Lion Air crash to tell Southwest safety alert was off","type":"story","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/28/boeing-didnt-tell-southwest-that-safety-feature-on-737-max-was-turned-off-wsj.html"},{"by":"minimaxir","descendants":2,"id":19780071,"kids":[19780525,19780668],"score":5,"time":1556556740,"title":"Nintendo pulls Switch game after dev reveals he sneaked in basic code editor","type":"story","url":"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-04-29-nintendo-pulls-switch-indie-game-from-eshop-after-dev-reveals-he-sneaked-in-basic-code-editor-easter-egg"},{"by":"guivr","descendants":5,"id":19780045,"kids":[19780422,19868526,19780086],"score":19,"time":1556556574,"title":"Show HN: CSS Scan 2.0 – Instantly check and copy the computed CSS of any element","type":"story","url":"https://getcssscan.com"},{"by":"ls612","descendants":19,"id":19779790,"kids":[19785234,19785221,19787489,19788778,19783487,19783740,19779798],"score":71,"time":1556555043,"title":"‘996’ Is China’s Version of Hustle Culture.

Reaching this tipping point implies we create a self-reinforcing feedback loop where the whole &#x27;Earth System&#x27; becomes destabilized which in turn leads to an increase in temperature of up to 50° in the next 100 years. See [3].<p>We think its clear there is reason to act now. There&#x27;s some &#x27;simple&#x27; points one can personally do to help:<p>* no flights\n* use public transport\n* use less energy \n* buy local groceries\n* cut back on dairy products<p>However, the largest impact on climate does not come from e.g. flights [1] but from the energy industry. One can only impact this indirectly.<p>Lots of the general public (including politics) seems to be oblivious to the problem at hand - ignoring the problem fully or at least partly. With Fridays for future [2] there is (at least in Germany) work done in this regard. At the same time it has just been decided there won&#x27;t be a tempo limit on german autobahns and no CO2-emission tax.<p>It looks like the best might be to improve education on the topic - but it has to happen fast. If more people try to reduce their emissions it might force the &#x27;bigger forces&#x27; to reduce their emissions, too.<p>This whole topic has a very negative ring to it - &quot;Life is probably over in 50 years&quot; is not something everyone wants to be confronted with.

I&#x27;ve had a few developer jobs so far in life and on balance, I haven&#x27;t really liked any of them. When I ask myself why, the reason is always the corporate bullshit that I must endure. I find the actual job of being a developer quite fun and enjoy solving problems and building things with code. I also have no troubles with the interpersonal side of developing, as far as working in a team and being a decent coworker is concerned. What I cannot stand is the corporate environment and it&#x27;s associated crap and rituals. I don&#x27;t like being &quot;obligated&quot; to put in extra time with my colleagues on team events and retreats. I don&#x27;t like daily stand-ups that are about talking about what you&#x27;re up to so you look busy, rather than sharing (both ways) useful info with the team. I don&#x27;t like a lot of the personalities I have to interact with at work (IMHO, certain departments&#x2F;roles attract people who I feel are inherently dishonest or manipulative. These people creep me out and I wish I didn&#x27;t have to be so close to them every workday). Many who read this will be able to add a lot to this list of complaints, as I can too.<p>What I want is a remote dev job where I close tickets. That is, one where the gig really is cash for functioning solution that meets spec, code standards, and QA. My ideal world would be where I log in somewhere, pull a respectably specified ticket with clear acceptance criteria, and then pull request myself to at least a modest quality of life. Does anyone know of any remote work where the hassle is just engineering related? I will specify that I am not interested in simply transitioning the interpersonal bullshit to a Skype-based model, so team-intensive remote work won&#x27;t suit this requirement. My greatest thanks for any insightful thoughts or resources you guys can provide.","time":1556396600,"title":"Ask HN: Sources of remote dev work with minimal human interaction?","type":"story"},{"by":"adamnemecek","descendants":7,"id":19767461,"kids":[19768449,19767700,19767898,19767910],"score":99,"time":1556397087,"title":"QuaterNet: A Quaternion-Based Recurrent Model for Human Motion","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/facebookresearch/QuaterNet"},{"by":"gmemstr","descendants":4,"id":19767394,"kids":[19767458,19768280,19768660],"score":42,"time":1556396177,"title":"Show HN: Platypus 3.0 – Server monitoring with websockets","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/gmemstr/Platypus"},{"by":"pplonski86","descendants":2,"id":19767326,"kids":[19767350,19769733],"score":1,"time":1556395189,"title":"Challenge Incredicat Can You Beat the Thinking Cat?","type":"story","url":"Https://incredicat.com"},{"by":"ducaale","descendants":41,"id":19767319,"kids":[19767445,19767432,19767414,19767808,19768041,19767441,19767440,19767507,19770988,19768056,19767704,19769188,19768070,19775144,19767982,19769947,19767998,19767859,19778739,19783675,19767500,19767957,19767621,19768046],"score":35,"time":1556395067,"title":"What No One Tells You About Noise Cancelling Headphones","type":"story","url":"https://www.pointchaser.com/noise-cancelling-headphones-ear-pain/"},{"by":"throwaway203719","descendants":7,"id":19767284,"kids":[19767631,19769254,19768133,19767714,19767582,19767474,19767529],"score":4,"text":"I have been with my company for a few years.  Over the past year or so, there&#x27;s been a huge management change.<p>We had been a small agile team and have grown like crazy with a bunch of new processes and managers added into the mix. I recently learned that I was not given a promotion due to reasons outside of my technical ability or developer velocity.  During my previous reviews leading up to this, there was never any indication that those reasons would hold me back and I specifically talk to my manager a few months ago telling them I want to get to the next level, and they told me they didn&#x27;t see any reason why I wouldn&#x27;t.<p>The new management that came in are making a huge push for diversity and most of the promotions were diverse co-workers, which is great.<p>But now I&#x27;m not sure what direction to go in?  It&#x27;s obvious to me that I&#x27;m not respected at the company.  I&#x27;m not a 10x developer.  I&#x27;m not diverse.  My big skill is that I can get features working and I volunteer to work on hard problems that have no clear solutions.<p>I still like my company and I do enjoy working with my co-workers.<p>I&#x27;m

My name is Rohan Pavuluri, and I’m launching an iPhone app called Office Hours (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunes.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;get-office-hours&#x2F;id1456480521\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunes.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;get-office-hours&#x2F;id145648052...</a>). The app lets you hold “office hours” by phone anytime, anywhere. You can think of it as the green Facebook messenger symbol but for calls. In real time, easily let your network know that you’re free to accept calls. And easily find out who in your network is free to accept a call from you.<p>I built Office Hours as a side project on the weekends with a friend to address the personal pain I feel scheduling phone calls. I run a nonprofit, and I love having conversations with everyone who reaches out to learn more about our work. But these conversations are generally painful to schedule for two reasons:<p>1. The back-and-forth email exchange to find a time slot is exhausting.<p>2. I don’t want to commit to time slots on my calendar because something that takes priority -- aka anything directly work-related -- may come up. Calendly doesn’t solve this.<p>Given that I have deadtime during grocery shopping, commutes, and other errands, I thought to myself, what if I could easily schedule all of these calls during my deadtime? What if I could just turn “on” my “office hours” and send a notification to “followers” that I’m free to chat? I also wanted to follow my friends and mentors and get notifications when they’re free, so I could eliminate the friction involved with scheduling. That&#x27;s how I got the idea for Office Hours.<p>How it works if you have inbound requests for your time: just download the app, add people who want to talk to you as “Followers”, and they’ll get a notification whenever you turn on your Office Hours. Whenever you’re on a call with someone who follows you, your Office Hours automatically close to your other Followers.<p>How it works if you want to request someone else’s time: just send them a Follow request. If they accept your request, you’ll get a notification when they open up their Office Hours. When you see they’re free, you can give them a call through the app.<p>I’m looking for any feedback, particularly around potential use cases. Some ideas: professional networking that’s not time-sensitive such as career advice chats, social catch-ups with friends and family, and teachers and students.<p>In the future, I hope to implement VoIP, so I can make it easier to schedule calls internationally. I also hope to implement end-to-end encryption. Feel free to email hi@getofficehours.com with any feedback too.","time":1556297610,"title":"Show HN: Office Hours – Hold office hours by phone anytime, anywhere","type":"story"},{"by":"juokaz","descendants":79,"id":19759490,"kids":[19760237,19760587,19760978,19759725,19761505,19760194,19760047,19760404,19760121,19759919,19759847],"score":130,"time":1556297607,"title":"Put Another Zero on Facebook’s Fine.

One way to find out is to send your password to the link here https:&#x2F;&#x2F;haveibeenpwned.com&#x2F;Passwords. However, while the owner of that website is a well respected security researcher, I still don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s wise to send my password to another website. So I downloaded the 24gb file, hashed my password and grepped the file for it.<p>That unfortunately took a long time and I realized this was the perfect opportunity to use a BloomFilter and test the inclusion of a password in a set.<p>With a bloomfilter, the 24gb file can be compressed down to ~2gb assuming a false positive rate of 1 in a million. You can achieve even better rates with lower false positives. Despite it dropping to 2gb, I wasn&#x27;t satisfied and decided to compress the bloomfilter using golomb codes. This type of data structure is known as a golomb set and I was able to get the database down to ~1.475gb.<p>That makes it small enough to exist in a microservice that any company can use to test whether users are using hacked passwords. With a golomb set the time to test a password was microseconds. I made some node js bindings and put the file in a simple express app. Now anyone can create a pwned password as a micro-service! It&#x27;s open source because you can audit the code and confirm no one is logging your passwords.<p>Anyway thought I&#x27;d share it since I&#x27;m more or less done with this. Future work could split the 2gb file into on disk files and therefore require significantly less ram to work. This would be a great use case of storing the entire list in a laptop or phone for example, where it would take 1.5gb of disk, but be able to quickly tell you if a password you are typing is in a

many folks here, I probably spend too much time reading about, trying and contemplate using many new languages.

Many people say &quot;work on projects&quot; or &quot;read lots of code.&quot; But that&#x27;s not what deliberate practice is.<p>According to Eriksson and Pool (2016, &quot;Peak&quot;), deliberate practice is different from what they call &quot;purposeful practice&quot; (trying very hard to push yourself past your limits and improve). In contrast, deliberate practice is both purposeful and &#x2F;informed&#x2F;. &quot;In particular, deliberate practice is informed and guided by the best performers&#x27; accomplishments and by an understanding of what these expert performers do to excel.&quot; (p. 98)<p>Is there anything that satisfies these criteria? (from p. 99-100):<p>1. Deliberate practice develop skills that other people have already figured out how to do and for which effective training techniques have been established.<p>2. Deliberate practice requires a student to constantly try things that are just beyond his or her current abilities. It demands near maximal effort, which is generally &#x2F;not enjoyable&#x2F;.<p>3. Deliberate practice involves well-defined, specific goals and often involves improving some aspect of the target performance; it is not aimed at some vague overall improvement.<p>4. Deliberate practice involves immediate feedback and modification of efforts in response to that feedback.<p>5. Deliberate practice nearly always involves building or modifying previously acquired skills by focusing on particular aspects of those skills and working to improve some &#x2F;specifically&#x2F;. Because of the way the new skills are built on top of existing skills, it is important for teachers to provide beginners with the correct fundamental skills in order to minimize the chances that the student will have to relearn those fundamental skills later when at a more advanced level.<p>The best violinists spend 3-6 hours in deliberate practice per day.

So far it&#x27;s great, catered meals, WFH days, nice work-life balance and so-on.<p>Yesterday I had my first 1:1 with my manager, in which he told me the company has rated me as a &quot;4 out of 7&quot; in terms of skill. The conversation was pretty friendly, we were laughing etc. but as the day went on I kept thinking &quot;4 out of 7? Based on what metrics?&quot;. I asked my manager what the rating is based on over Slack, no response. Later in the day after we had talked about other stuff, asked again briefly, no response.<p>What the job has been like so far:<p>• I worked with design in my 1st week to prototype 3 different design systems in CRA apps – basically todo-list apps using different UI libraries. The goal was to see which React app was easiest for designers or Rails devs (and anyone else who is anti-styled components) to jump in and modify styles, and which system seemed easiest to extend. Ended up choosing a system, and building a bridge between CSS and styled so devs can use styled-components and designers can use SASS and both will work, design seemed happy, we presented to the company, everyone clapped. Yay, great first week.<p>• The next week was training 8 hours a day with the other new hires, and I got no tasks for a week.<p>• Third week I&#x27;m back into the mix. We just switched to Auth0 so I was tasked to write the e2e tests to test logging in with our new provider, using various authentication methods. I also reviewed a number of PRs, and fixed some small&#x2F;easy front-end bugs.<p>• 4th week I had my 1:1 where they said I&#x27;m a &quot;4 out of 7&quot;. I know I haven&#x27;t exactly been doing rocket science in my first month here, but I&#x27;ve done everything they&#x27;ve told me to within the allotted time. We have 2-week sprints and usually only have a couple of tasks. From my perspective this job is really easy, so I&#x27;m confused.<p>Anyone heard of this system, or know what I can do to improve my rating?","time":1555517422,"title":"4/7 Engineer","type":"story"},{"by":"mxbck","descendants":3,"id":19683896,"kids":[19699662,19699502,19689069],"score":18,"time":1555517857,"title":"Bringing Webrings Back from the 90s","type":"story","url":"https://mxb.dev/blog/webring-kit/"},{"by":"skrebbel","descendants":5,"id":19683901,"kids":[19684045,19685320,19684006,19684023],"score":6,"text":"Stripe just emailed their customers a link to this page:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;billing&#x2F;migration&#x2F;strong-customer-authentication<p>If I read it right, it means that the EU is forcing a 2-factor authentication flow for every single payment, recurring or not.<p>I&#x27;m running a SaaS business (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talkjs.com). My reading of this is that we have to send every EU customer we have an email each month that goes &quot;Hi! It&#x27;s time to pay again! ^_^&quot; with a link. They then have to click that link, login to our site, and then go through a 2-factor payment authentication flow. This means they need to have all the required gear for that on them, which depending on their bank will often mean having a special bank-issued debit card reader ready that can generate unique one-time auth codes.<p>Our customers will get one such email every month for every service they use.

I thought of joining a company which works in Microservices but they all need experience which I do not have. So, I am rather confused about how to go ahead. I see this as a problem while learning about any new stuff. I can&#x27;t get into a company without any experience on the technology and I can&#x27;t get experience without solving real problems in it. This is like a chicken and egg problem for me. So, here are some questions I have -<p>1. While learning a new skill, how do I put myself in a situation where I will have to solve real world problems. I can think of doing a weekend project. But consider the case of learning about distributed applications. I will need a real customer facing application there to face some real problems.<p>2. I feel if I get a chance to work in a company which uses those technologies, I will be able to get a good experience. Is that a way? How do I get into it as a beginner?<p>3.

It&#x27;s always been some sort of blind job application, and I&#x27;m tired of the rat race. I&#x27;m a software engineer with a non-STEM degree but does the degree not matter much anymore(?). A lot of the problem would be due to the fact that I&#x27;ve only taken shorter-term jobs, all at very small companies.<p>Here&#x27;s an summary of my work history as a programmer:<p>Held a total of 7 jobs over 11 calendar years. 90% web dev work. 5 of those are contractor (only 2 of which are 30-40 hrs&#x2F;week), one short full-time job and one part-time job (those two were 8 and 10 years ago respectively). I might spend anywhere from 2 to 20 months unemployed in between. Out of all these jobs, I made connections from the 2nd job, and current job. But they usually don&#x27;t know anyone that is hiring when I contact them, nor do they really contact me first about work.<p>So I am at a standstill on how to build up my reputation after so much time spent not building it. I can see myself with two options:<p>* Return to college and complete a CS degree as a BS or MS. Use the resources in college to network with people. Talk to professors, join career-oriented clubs, go to job fairs, hackathons and take internships, convert to full-time.<p>* Harder route: Apply to larger companies for full-time roles, and interview prep. I don&#x27;t know of any good reliable sources for reading your interview approach. I&#x27;m talking to local developers through a Slack channel to see if anyone has time to mock interview, but opening up time is hard.<p>I am open to other options besides these two. Let me know what I should do to build that network effectively, and get better leads to jobs without cold applying so I don&#x27;t have to be in the rat race forever.","time":1555095279,"title":"Ask HN: A lot of jobs, but little reputation.

My name is Sarah and I&#x27;m a senior studying computer science at MIT. Over the past 9 months I&#x27;ve been working on Allparel (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;allparel.io). Allparel uses tags that are auto-generated from clothing product images in combination with product descriptions to match search and filter queries.<p>I had the idea of using computer vision to improve text search a couple years ago while shopping on Urban Outfitters. Every time I searched something, almost everything (even products that should have been returned) would get filtered out. Because search didn&#x27;t work, I instead had to browse pages upon pages of products to find what I wanted. I noticed that the reason search wasn&#x27;t correctly finding matching products was because the product titles and descriptions were often missing information. Text search can only be as good as the textual information provided about a product, so I decided to train classifiers that could automatically generate search tags for a product given just its image.<p>Allparel is live right now, and lists hundreds of thousands of products from retailers like Nordstroms, Macy&#x27;s, Maurices, and more! Mens&#x27; products, as well as additional retailers and product tags, will also be coming soon.  In the meantime, let me know your thoughts and feedback!","time":1554826051,"title":"Show HN: Allparel - Fashion Search Powered by AI Generated Product Tags","type":"story"},{"by":"stanzheng","descendants":1,"id":19616167,"kids":[19616672,19616476],"score":19,"time":1554826404,"title":"Anthos","type":"story","url":"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/hybrid-cloud/new-platform-for-managing-applications-in-todays-multi-cloud-world"},{"by":"LolWolf","descendants":4,"id":19616021,"kids":[19619031,19616429],"score":1,"text":"Heya HN!

2017, I made a Google Cloud Account to use Google Maps API for a Computer Science student group project and put my debit card in. I naively put a $5 account notification in, thinking it was a cap. This project was defunct after 2017 and I should have just closed the Cloud account.<p>All was fine up until January 2019 when the Google Cloud Credentials were somehow stolen and over the course of two days on Google Maps API, racked up enough API calls to generate over $14k invoice. I disabled the Google Cloud Account a day after I noticed an email from Google Cloud. Google Cloud did try to use debit card to deduct from checking account, but I don&#x27;t leave thousands sitting around in it, so charge was declined.<p>I talked to Google Cloud Billing and they have not been helpful, telling me to contact my bank. Today, I got a scary email from a collections agency demanding I login to my Google Cloud account and pay the bill! Worst part is, this API used to be free, until Google started charging exorbitant amounts for it.<p>I know I did not make these API calls -- if you looked at the call volume history, there was nothing for well over a year, until those two days in 2019, it started going crazy (and the project is not running on any server or being used in any way). I suspect a group member might have accidentally leaked the credentials.<p>I know AWS has waived costs[1] like this in the past, but Google is not known for customer support. I should have been more proactive in setting up a cap.<p>Appreciate any advice or Google contacts to talk to an actual human. Should I see if Google is willing to actually verify this was unauthorized usage or just lower the bill?

We see the second problem here - juniors are struggling to land a job. So why companies do not employ junior developers?<p>During several interviews with recruiters, founders and CTO&#x27;s, we realized that the main problem is that there are no people in companies who are ready to teach juniors. Experienced team members don’t have enough time for mentoring as they have to perform their tasks. It made us think that maybe there is an opportunity to create a service that can provide remote mentors to these companies.

places of different sizes as data scientist (from start-up to mega-corp), and I&#x27;ve seen different ways to evaluate employee&#x27;s performance (think yearly performance review).

I would be curious to hear your input, what works and what doesn&#x27;t in your opinion. Evaluation methodologies I have often seen are:<p>- Demonstration of impact on business: In this case it&#x27;s up to the data scientist to justify as best as possible what business decision (or internal milestone) was made because of an analysis performed. In theory it makes sense (= your focus should be on impacting business), in practice I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen a single analysis changing the course of anything; decisions are driven by many factors, your analysis being only one of them.<p>- Tool usage: I guess some programmers are evaluated the same way; basically, you develop a tool for co-workers to perform analyses with. The more the tool is used, the better it is for you (it&#x27;s assumed that high usage = high business relevance). In this case the usage is sometimes easier to track and more impartial, but it&#x27;s often difficult to develop a data science tool covering many use-cases, and one frequently ends-up with a niche product with low usage.","time":1554711193,"title":"Ask HN: Data scientists, how are you being evaluated within your

I would like to ask you guys for some advice. Up until recently, I was vaguely aware of one of my friends being involved in some side business. Just yesterday, I found out that the business - a startup - was going to use blockchains for whatever reason. Not only that, he is the founder of said startup! His team has received some investment and has conducted a blockchain workshop or two, and they seem to have no signs of stopping.<p>Now, I know that there are probably blockchain and cryptocurrency advocates among the HN crowd. That being said, I am skeptical about him running a startup that focuses solely on blockchains. The problems he wants to address (e.g. fraud prevention in charity money transactions) could be easily solved using conventional databases with basic security measures. While I laud my friend for embarking on this venture, I can&#x27;t help but feel as if this will lead nowhere. His team is basing their tech stack off an open source blockchain developed for a Chinese cryptocurrency, though they are not in charge of it directly - they have an IT team for that.<p>Both of us are still university students. I have no intention of discouraging him, but at the same time, I would like to nudge him in the right direction. Feel free to ask any questions, but please note that I won&#x27;t bring up any names unless absolutely necessary.

Honestly, I would throw the last 40 away in a heartbeat if given the chance. I was an only child born to narcissists. I spent my adolescence as a military brat moving every 2-3 years. It was brutal at times but I got really good at reading people, having the reset switch pushed on my life so often and being forced to brave yet another wave of a new &quot;community.&quot; What I generally saw in others wasn&#x27;t good. One of my early memories being at a new school and watching most of a class taunt a kid whose entire body has been terribly burned. This was probably second grade and was the beginning of a pattern I&#x27;d witness. I&#x27;d go on to try to befriend and defend outcasts but I felt it was sort of a losing battle, that the world was just going to grind them up regardless (cue starfish analogy).<p>I went on to work in a lot fields before landing in programming and had a knack for getting into places where I could see behind the curtain. This is ultimately what I think gutted me. I was disillusioned again and again seeing the gulf between what really takes place and what most believe happens. Should happen. This occurred in the military, medicine and law enforcement. I was shaken repeatedly by what I saw and deeply dejected.<p>My guts finally gave way in earnest about seven years ago after experiencing burnout at a job that was knowingly running me into the ground (I left). I&#x27;ve just been staggering forward resentfully while trying to numb myself since. While I&#x27;m fully aware of how unhealthy it is but I&#x27;ve isolated myself to the extreme nonetheless. I always felt divorced and frustrated by people but the alienation feels too far gone now. I&#x27;ve been through the gambit of treatment options and providers. The drugs, therapy, none of it seeming to make a difference. Now, I&#x27;m beyond tired. I have no interest in another 40 years.

This brings communication benefits that other productivity tools fundamentally cannot provide. Wherever you are working, you can essentially pull up a chair next to your coworker to see and discuss what they are working on.<p>This live code view leads to a many other productivity benefits. Existing tools will let you know your teammates&#x27; task, but not the exact lines of code they are modifying. CoDiff on the other hand, can notify you in real-time when you conflict with one of your teammates. This greatly reduces the time spent in resolving merge conflicts, prevents duplicated work, and unobtrusively improves productivity.<p>In the future, CoDiff will integrate with your favorite editors and other productivity tools for even greater benefits. A few examples: get conflict notifications in your IDE, set statuses according to Trello task, and share links to live code snippets on Slack.<p>We currently have the first <i>alpha</i> build available on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codiff.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codiff.com</a>. It’s completely free now and we would be extremely grateful for anyone to try it out.

Also HDL&#x27;s: Verilog and VHDL.<p>What&#x27;s the problem?<p>They requires all students to take the following courses:<p>Intro to Programming 1 and 2\nHow Computers Work\nWeb Development<p>This will consume somewhere between 1 and 1.5 years.<p>Yes, someone who knows little to nothing should take these modules.<p>What about someone who has years of experience and some relevant academic work?<p>These programs do not have a sensible assessment test one could take in order to demonstrate capability.<p>I think this is a serious problem.<p>At the very least this does not respect student&#x27;s time and prior accomplishments. Forcing someone to devote two semesters to &quot;Intro to Programming&quot; when they know the material inside-out is silly at best.<p>A further problem is that it seems none of the organizations have any interest in addressing this issue. Repeated pleads at the highest levels have resulted in nothing.<p>And so someone like me is facing the reality of having to spend a year+ &quot;learning&quot; how computers work, how to write a &quot;for&quot; loop and use arrays when hardware I designed that has flown in space and I have designed and programmed embedded computers from scratch --like 8080, 6502, MC86K, 8085, R65F11, C8051F100, PIC and other processors and published mobile apps.<p>This isn&#x27;t necessarily about money but that is likely a factor as well.<p>You ought to be able to prove what you know through a well designed test and enter these kinds of programs at the appropriate academic level.","time":1554498380,"title":"One of the problems with CS education today","type":"story"},{"by":"oftenwrong","descendants":45,"id":19586887,"kids":[19587497,19587395,19587630,19587705,19587817,19587691,19587268,19588493,19587411,19587585,19588260,19589746],"score":59,"time":1554497313,"title":"The Problem with “Modern Monetary Theory” Is That It's True","type":"story","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanlewis/2019/02/21/the-problem-with-modern-monetary-theory-is-that-its-true/#4e92523456fb"},{"by":"howard941","descendants":2,"id":19586953,"kids":[19596181,19597443],"score":6,"time":1554497740,"title":"Facebook’s ad system seems to discriminate by race and gender","type":"story","url":"https://www.economist.com/business/2019/04/04/facebooks-ad-system-seems-to-discriminate-by-race-and-gender"},{"by":"zyngaro","descendants":5,"id":19586701,"kids":[19586803,19623629,19664565,19586932],"score":1,"text":"Hello HN !\nI would like to have an overview of the tech and startup scene in Switzerland.

Real world experience and examples would be excellent (if you have them).<p>Let me know your thoughts, experience and wisdom!<p>Cheers,\nRobin","time":1554315690,"title":"Ask HN: Should a software free trial be behind an email sign-up wall?","type":"story"},{"by":"amaccuish","descendants":144,"id":19565759,"kids":[19565958,19566034,19567928,19565951,19565988,19566120,19566123,19571155,19565978,19566411,19566874],"score":156,"time":1554315291,"title":"Boeing software under scrutiny as Ethiopia prepares crash report","type":"story","url":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-airplane-software/exclusive-boeing-software-engaged-repeatedly-before-crash-sources-idUSKCN1RF0YU"},{"by":"neuronerdo","descendants":2,"id":19565560,"kids":[19567346,19566880,19568548],"score":16,"time":1554314288,"title":"Alcohol-induced brain damage continues after alcohol is stopped","type":"story","url":"https://neurosciencenews.com/alcohol-brain-damage-10985/"},{"by":"laurex","descendants":4,"id":19565487,"kids":[19567558,19566440,19565934],"score":8,"time":1554313810,"title":"Could Consciousness Come Down to the Way Things Vibrate?","type":"story","url":"https://interestingengineering.com/could-consciousness-come-down-to-the-way-things-vibrate"},{"by":"tshannon","descendants":10,"id":19565379,"kids":[19565572,19565567,19565603],"score":5,"time":1554313287,"title":"Patagonia Vests: Wall Street Will Need to Work for Them Now","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-03/sorry-wall-streeters-you-now-need-to-earn-your-patagonia-vests"},{"by":"nathanmarz","descendants":33,"id":19565267,"kids":[19565817,19565738,19565470,19565577,19567137,19570464,19566798,19565544,19565449,19565605,19569864,19565535,19565693],"score":39,"time":1554312465,"title":"Introducing Red Planet Labs with $5M in funding","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/red-planet-labs/introducing-red-planet-labs-2a0304a67312"},{"by":"thtthings","descendants":2,"id":19565245,"kids":[19565362,19567041],"score":8,"time":1554312335,"title":"IBM AI can predict with 95% accuracy which workers are about to quit their jobs","type":"story","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/03/ibm-ai-can-predict-with-95-percent-accuracy-which-employees-will-quit.html"},{"by":"jmagaro88","descendants":43,"id":19565408,"kids":[19566214,19565517,19566548,19566187,19566895,19566422,19566356,19567491,19565743,19565632,19565789],"score":157,"time":1554313417,"title":"Two More Cases of Third-Party Facebook App Data Exposure","type":"story","url":"https://www.upguard.com/breaches/facebook-user-data-leak"},{"by":"chewz","descendants":69,"id":19565305,"kids":[19566035,19565613,19565778,19565900,19565575,19566280,19565636,19565815,19565751,19567316,19565950,19565698,19569465,19565786],"score":76,"time":1554312744,"title":"No, Your Instagram ‘Influence’ Is Not as Good as Cash, Club Owner Says","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/world/phillipines-hotel-influencers-social-media.html"},{"by":"atomicalchemy","descendants":40,"id":19565224,"kids":[19565506,19565376,19565731,19567300,19565649,19567002,19570008,19568529,19569995,19565841,19566518,19568707,19567792],"score":99,"text":"Hello, HN.<p>I’m Thomas Eiden, founder of Atomic Alchemy.<p>Atomic Alchemy will manufacture nuclear medicine and the radioactive materials used to make it, using several compact  nuclear reactors.<p>These will be the first privately-owned nuclear reactors for nuclear medicine production. They are merely higher-powered versions of previously-licensed reactor designs that currently reside at universities. These reactor designs are passively safe and cannot melt down. With improvements in modeling and simulation that have occurred in the last few years, it is quicker and cheaper than ever to license and construct such a facility. But to be clear—we won’t be manufacturing reactors—we’ll be a chemical&#x2F;drug manufacturer in the same way that Delta Airlines doesn’t manufacture planes or airports, but is a transportation company.<p>Before starting Atomic Alchemy, I was the lead reactor core designer at the Advanced Test Reactor at Idaho National Laboratory. My main job each operating cycle was to arrange the reactor core in such a way to allow the United States Nuclear Navy to run successful material experiments for their next generation submarines and aircraft carriers. I’ve always been interested in production and efficiency, and the issues currently plaguing nuclear medicine production have been of great interest to me all the way back to when I operated a reactor in college.<p>Nuclear medicine is used in a wide variety of diagnostic imaging procedures and cancer treatments. The most common procedure is the radiocardiogram to diagnose cardiological issues, and brachytherapy for cancer treatment.<p>Unbeknownst to many, there is a critical shortage of nuclear medicine worldwide--right now. The main failure in the supply chain is the fact that the entire world’s feedstock for nuclear medicine primarily comes from six government-run reactors, most of which are over 45 years old and will be retired in the next 10 years. Additionally, these government-run reactors are scientific research reactors and are not set up to efficiently produce these materials.<p>I have a design for a manufacturing facility that combines the entire supply chain, from irradiation, to chemical purification, to medicine production. This will allow Atomic Alchemy to fill the void as more aging reactors are shut down and allow those that remain to focus on their true purpose—science.<p>Currently, the reactors, chemical purification, and pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities are all in separate facilities, sometimes oceans apart. By shrinking the entire supply chain into a single facility, manufacturing costs can be slashed by up to 50%, as regulatory, shipping, and myriad other costs associated with the radioactive material decaying in transit, is reduced.<p>The market for radioactive feedstock alone is well over a one billion dollar market worldwide, and is constrained by the current supply. As the standard of living abroad continues to improve, developing markets will demand even more nuclear medicine.<p>Looking forward to your feedback and questions.","time":1554312180,"title":"Launch HN: Atomic Alchemy (YC W19) – Manufacturing Nuclear Medicine","type":"story"},{"by":"superhater","descendants":23,"id":19565170,"kids":[19566783,19565961,19566050,19589620,19591782,19565461,19572703,19579853,19566835,19566393,19565290,19567350],"score":21,"text":"I&#x27;ve been working as a dev at a hedge fund for less than a year and I just can&#x27;t believe how awful it is:<p>- all I do is operate and maintain hacky old ETL jobs<p>- I spend hours and sometimes days editing databases and config files<p>- there are no best practices<p>- issues are swept under the rug or just passed around the team until people forget about them<p>- my manager is a manger because he&#x27;s the only person that hasn&#x27;t left the team over the years<p>- everybody has an opinion on everything even though they have zero proven experience on the subject<p>- people are not focused at all<p>- people don&#x27;t grow, they just get comfortable and complacent<p>- it&#x27;s like a 9 to 5 except that you&#x27;re supposed to work for 10 hours a day<p>and the list goes on..<p>This is my first full time job so I&#x27;m super confused.

everyone, in succession of my previous posts about the SaaS I am trying to validate I decided to actually sit down and make a stepped process of the actions I should take to validate as best as I can my idea before I start building an alpha version of the service.<p>Here is what I have come up with so far.<p>1. Launch a simple one page landing page with a signup section for their email.<p>2. Expose it to potential customers for a week: reddit, linkedin etc<p>3. See if I have any signups, if so how many<p>4. If I had some subs, run some questionaires by them to see what they really want, also ask for what troubles them the most and if they have tried other similar solutions and what went wrong.<p>5. Launch a more detailed landing page with the price plans and a pre-order option with a big discount. This way the idea will be validated by having users to actually pay for it, which is the hardest part<p>6. Send follow up emails to update every contact that has signed up<p>7. Validate the idea against how many sales it did within the first week(or month?)<p>8. If I did any sales, start building the MVP while staying in close touch with the early bird customers<p>9. Maybe in the meantime invest on some ads?<p>So far I have made a landing page with the proposed features and three price plans that asks the user to sign up and logs his plan selection. I haven&#x27;t got any subscriptions yet but I got some valuable feedback that essentially said that the page is not clear enough as to what the service is doing and how it&#x27;s solving the problem it is.

I&#x27;m just coming off the end of having had my Instagram account deleted by Facebook because a graffiti artist and his trolls were able to flag my IG account and left me unable to appeal[1]. 20k followers, 4 years of work gone. My entire customer base is primarily on IG and they are shocked to find that I&#x27;m not; so I feel the pain every day and the fact that I&#x27;m no longer advertising on FB because of it is a loss-loss in my opinion. Can not explain how upsetting it is for me.<p>To add insult to injury Amazon randomly delisted my product. I randomly received an email that they removed me [2]. I checked the listing and saw that a customer had left a bad review. I went to contact that customer [3] and saw that the seller in that instance wasn&#x27;t me, it was Adorama, a retailer who sells the product I created. I figured this was the sale that got my account flagged, so I responded trying to explain that I sell an OEM product so I wouldn&#x27;t sell anything used&#x2F;broken[4]. They then respond that my response is not sufficient[5]. I then decide to give them what they want, contact my manufacturer, come up with a plan [6]. Pretty long, with evidence, a spreadsheet, and even more detailed notes at the end of the email.<p>Today they&#x27;ve just gotten back to me saying they refuse to reinstate it and that I&#x27;m shit out of luck [7]. I am livid at this point. What else did they want? And if they weren&#x27;t going to reinstate me in the first place, why not just say that? According to my account dashboard my account is in perfect &#x27;health&#x27;[8] and there is absolutely no indication that there is anything wrong. I feel like I am being trolled.<p>It feels so perverse because I live in Seattle so I am always rooting for Amazon. Now, after having finally taken the leap and quit my job and started a company that&#x27;s beginning to do well, the companies that I&#x27;ve always applauded are totally screwing up my business and leaving me stranded with no options. Not even a customer support number. I don&#x27;t typically get stressed but the helplessness in the hands of these companies has been keeping me up at night. I <i>feel</i> the stress.<p>Does anyone have any ideas of what I could do? I live in Seattle so are there any offices or people I could try reasoning with in person? And also if anyone can tell me what I did wrong. If anyone has any information that could be useful I would seriously appreciate it because this is quite literally my livelihood and my entire life.<p>Thank you for reading.

In the technology sector, two out of three employees think they could find a better job inside of two months.”<p>Excerpt From: Doerr, John. “Measure What Matters: How Google, Bono, and the Gates Foundation Rock the World with OKRs.” Apple Books.","time":1554172240,"title":"Ask HN: Would you leave your company for a raise of 20%?","type":"story"},{"by":"aerophilic","descendants":13,"id":19550382,"kids":[19550817,19551863,19550866,19551008,19551870,19550849,19550811],"score":28,"time":1554170501,"title":"Chinese Rocket company successfully demonstrates 'landing' of rocket","type":"story","url":"https://twitter.com/Linkspace_China/status/1112776139444047873"},{"by":"obl","descendants":368,"id":19550282,"kids":[19553058,19552073,19550969,19551865,19551054,19551494,19551705,19550873,19551668,19552187,19551049,19551246,19552473,19552559,19550775,19552689,19556067,19556499,19553703,19552390,19552718,19553512,19552119,19552126,19551020,19552319,19554434,19552475,19556048,19553720,19552070,19551039,19551630,19550899,19555984,19551712,19550845,19551069],"score":696,"time":1554169188,"title":"French ISPs Ordered to Block Sci-Hub and LibGen","type":"story","url":"https://torrentfreak.com/court-orders-french-isps-to-block-sci-hub-and-libgen-190331/"},{"by":"thoward37","descendants":2,"id":19550184,"kids":[19550431,19550786],"score":4,"time":1554167927,"title":"Documentation Considered Harmful","type":"story","url":"http://blog.thoward37.me/articles/documentation-considered-harmful/"},{"by":"jostmey","descendants":12,"id":19550028,"kids":[19550489,19564684,19552037,19555339,19551523],"score":44,"time":1554166549,"title":"Tumor Specific Immune Receptors Computationally Identifiable","type":"story","url":"http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/79/7/1671.short?rss=1"},{"by":"pplonski86","descendants":26,"id":19550011,"kids":[19551540,19559353,19551320,19561819,19550864,19552136,19550694],"score":33,"time":1554166404,"title":"How to separate your data from your code","type":"story","url":"https://negfeedback.blogspot.com/2019/04/how-to-separate-your-data-from-your-code.html"},{"by":"thesuperdope","descendants":6,"id":19549853,"kids":[19551176,19553876,19550562,19550448],"score":14,"text":"Today I noticed my checking account went overdraft by over $20 and I just have a couple of bucks in my wallet.

This is my first full-time position and I&#x27;ve completed a year at this company now. I&#x27;m in my mid-twenties and I want to try starting a tech company, but I barely get any time during the day to get anything done.<p>Everyday is just office, gym, shower, dinner, 1-2 hour gap, sleep. I try to get some side project work done during that 1-2 hour gap but I&#x27;m exhausted by that time so I don&#x27;t get much done. My parents said that they would be willing to put me up, if I decided to resign and tried to start a company.<p>But I know that, that support will not last very long, because all our friends and family members will judge me and my parents for spoiling me like that. They will say that I&#x27;m just slacking off and tricking my parents into thinking that I&#x27;m trying to start a company, so eventually either I or my parents will get too frustrated with me living like that and I&#x27;ll have to start looking for a job again. My guess is this will last about 1-2 years.<p>My therapist says I should quit if its making me miserable or change my point of view towards my work. My father, on the other hand, is of the opinion that I should power through the misery and continue working on the startup on the side, but at the same time he is willing to support me no matter what path I choose. He has a point plus my skills have improved a lot, but I get very depressed thinking that I would be throwing away my youth for job security instead of using to do something more ambitious. I have no dependents and a decent amount of savings.<p>I was also considering improving my skillset during the time I would be staying with my parents, like doing an online bootcamp like Lambda school.<p>What should I do HN community?

Because certain essential emotional realms are not explored. If swearing is a big deal, then most likely there isn&#x27;t much genuine laughter as well, people are afraid to speak up, no criticism, no valuable feedback, engineers are easily intimidated by the higher ups into tighter deadlines, no comradery, etc.<p>It is such a good heuristics that I&#x27;m tempted to conclude that no cussing means a room filled with losers. I don&#x27;t mean gross language, I mean something like occasional fuck here and there.<p>I&#x27;m Russian, and this is the experience I have with Russian people, but I think it also applies to American and European cultures. In general Russian people are more emotionally reserved, and the language doesn&#x27;t help either, because there are no equivalent words for &quot;you&quot; and &quot;guys&quot;.<p>I think cursing is some kind of mental barrier. If it is not broken, then there is an array of social problems that most likely will remain unsolved. It&#x27;s kind of like first sex in a relationship, if you don&#x27;t have it early then the relationship will probably go sour. I&#x27;ve seen entire room go dumb to almost comical level and be unable to decide whether the task is going to take 1.5 days or 2 days, as if that mattered at all. Because of bad emotional energy, engineers were afraid to say 2, because then there is a question why not 1.5 or even 1, but it&#x27;s not really a question, it&#x27;s pressure and intimidation. Explaining why in honest terms even without cursing is not within the domain of acceptable things to say.<p>I know it sounds weird. It&#x27;s just that there are vastly different meetings, some are productive and positive where cursing is not a big deal, and some are a game of trying to save face and look good, without there being any need to do so.","time":1553953953,"title":"Ask HN: Do You Cuss in Meetings?","type":"story"},{"by":"EndXA","descendants":58,"id":19529374,"kids":[19530625,19530985,19530024,19530571,19530126,19531266,19530142,19530615,19530852,19531579,19533974,19530600,19530576,19530581,19530624,19530890],"score":72,"time":1553953780,"title":"A study of ethicists finds they’re no more ethical than the rest of us","type":"story","url":"https://qz.com/1582149/ethicists-are-no-more-ethical-than-the-rest-of-us-study-finds/"},{"by":"traderjane","descendants":71,"id":19529308,"kids":[19529946,19530757,19529558,19529746,19552574,19532804,19531538,19529947],"score":180,"time":1553952915,"title":"TypeScript 3.4","type":"story","url":"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-4/"},{"by":"reiinakano","descendants":40,"id":19529269,"kids":[19530554,19530586,19530606,19530475,19534219,19532427,19530726,19532029,19537149],"score":94,"text":"Also, how many years of experience do you have?

I have been working on this by doing psychotherapy among other things. \nLast year I moved to Germany in order to work as a software engineer (me asking for advice before doing that[0]). Recently I was offered a 3 year Marie Curie fellowship to become a PhD student with focus on geometry processing. \nHere are my pros and cons.<p>Pros:<p>- Currently I believe that I would be much more interested in doing research than continue working as a software engineer. I really like the idea of trying to solve problems that have not been solved and contributing to (open) science.<p>- Financially the fellowship is so good that I would earn the same amount of money as my current job. In addition I would not have any other obligations except research.<p>- The PhD city seems great and I would prefer to live there compared to the city I currently live in.<p>- I would be able to be a visiting researcher at great labs in cities I would like to visit.<p>Cons:<p>- I have been reading for the past weeks that mental health issues are quite common among PhD students[1]. Considering my mental state I am afraid that the PhD will break me mentally.<p>- I do not want to work in academia in the future. Ideally I would like to work remotely having a balance between research and coding (is this even possible?). This is my biggest concern, because it would not make sense to do it if it would not help me reach this goal.<p>- Doing a PhD takes a lot of commitment and I am unsure if I will still want to continue doing it in 2 years.

I assume that the better our IP address is hidden, the more effort it would take to attack our firewall to try and infiltrate our network. I also implement things like policies preventing external resources in email and stringent port and website filtering. In addition, we pay for all available security enhancements offered by vendors (e.g. O365 advanced threat protection, safelinks, DLP, etc.).<p>In O365, I have strict spam filtering policies and safe links enabled. One of the features of this service is quarantining suspicious email. In this quarantine, you can review emails and delete or release them and mark sender as safe as part of the workflow. In this quarantine, one of the tools is a “preview” where you can see the original email. I noticed that despite lack of warnings about dangers of viewing the original emails, this preview was rendering images that are embedded in the emails. Even though safelinks is enabled and the src endpoints reflect this in the code, I wondered how the images were being served. So I set up a test to send myself an email designed to get caught and quarantined with an embedded image referring an image on a server I have in the cloud. I monitored the http logs as I opened the quarantined email preview and sure enough my local IP address appeared in the http log.<p>We are a small firm in the high net-worth financial services industry and am concerned that my local IP could be leaked this way.
