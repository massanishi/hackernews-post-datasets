Obviously this slows us down and makes time short again. I try to raise awareness of technical dept and common anti patterns, but i don&#x27;t come through. I talked to some of my coworkers and they see the same, but all of us seem unable to change a thing.<p>I wonder if anyone can give me directions on how to improve things. Especially with the product owners&#x2F;managers that have less technical background.<p>Or maybe a piece of good advice on how to deal with that personally. I also considered if I was the problem - by somehow misjudging the situation or something - but i think like myself, so don&#x27;t spare the criticism.<p>---<p>A current example of the type of problems we face.<p>A big move from our DC to a private cloud based solution is coming up because our hoster closes that location.<p>My coworker and I where charged with building the new infrastructure. We built a sweet CI&#x2F;CD infrastructure using gitlab and kubernetes. We did in ~5 months which took ~10 devs twice that the last time. So things are improving actually - yay! All our newer services where easily migrated, new prometheus monitoring is a treat. There is the last big monolith tho - two people and a short hard deadline while maintaining all the other services. So we sat together with the relevant devs and decided to fix away all those doodads in nginx and varnish configs and make the software usable on the new infrastructure together.<p>Now product owners start to complain that their tickets don&#x27;t get completed and some even started to pull rank and moved devs to other tasks - moar tracking. They seem unable to grasp that a site can actually fail when load can&#x27;t be handled, so they don&#x27;t get stressed like i do.<p>Currently the site takes ~20 seconds to render at some places. so there is no urgent need for improvements?

We provide low-cost GPUs for Deep Learning training and deployment on semi-decentralized servers.<p>We started Snark AI during our PhD programs at Princeton University. As deep learning researchers we always experienced lack of GPU resources. Renting out GPUs on the cloud didn&#x27;t fit in our budget, and purchasing GPU cards was difficult -- at that time, so many GPUs were being taken away by the crypto-miners. Then we found out that GPU mining profits lag far behind public cloud GPU prices.<p>On top of that, we figured out that there&#x27;s a way to run Neural Network inference and crypto-mining simultaneously without hurting mining hash rate. This observation is a little counterintuitive, but it turns out that anti-asic hashing algorithms are designed to be extremely memory intensive, which leaves a good chunk of the CUDA cores idle. We can utilize the leftover compute power to run Neural Network inference extremely cost efficiently, which could be a life savior for large-scale inference tasks. <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;snark.ai&#x2F;blog\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;snark.ai&#x2F;blog</a><p>At the same time, we provide low cost raw hardware access for Neural Network training. We aim to be up to 10 times cheaper than on-demand instances on public cloud, undercutting preempteble&#x2F;spot instance by up to 2x.

I have no work experience and had a lot of help to get through the degree. About half of the coding assignments required for my degree I either didn’t do or was carried. I also got generous accommodations due to a disability. My in major GPA is 3.0.<p>I take an extremely long time to come up with solutions to any problems. I enjoy trying to solve problems and coming up with a high level solution, but I get stuck for hours on details or miss vital parts of the algorithm so often it becomes a drag. Personal projects take me an extreme amount of time too and I haven’t made any of note. I’m not good at organizing code and I am not detail orientated which means I tend to get a lot of one off type errors and can take hours to find them. Even problems I’ve seen before, I’ll likely forget the solution or fail to recreate it.<p>To give a concrete example of some of the above, just this morning I tried to code the brute force solution following problem: Give two sorted arrays return the median. I spent over an hour trying to implement the brute force solution involving linearly going through each array and couldn’t code it in Python. The entire time I was struggling to figure out how to increase the respective index variables given different cases, how I would ensure one of the numbers the indices landed was the median, how to differentiate which of the array indices I was keeping track of was the actual median and finally how to determine the next number I needed if the lengths of both arrays were even.<p>Many problems go the same way.

I started writing code when I was 10 so we are looking at 20 years of coding. I went to unicersity to study software engineering and I&#x27;ve been working as a software engineer since I turned 18. Several years ago I was promoted to tech lead of the most profitable product that the company I work for makes. But truthfully my heart has been elsewhere for a long time. I truly wanted to build something from the ground up myself. And though I&#x27;ve been trying hard for several years, it seems that I&#x27;m very stuck. Though I am really good at Linux, networking, databases and I&#x27;ve been eating, breathing and dreaming all the populat ML and AI libraries in recent years, I figured I can&#x27;t do it on my own. As Torvalds famously once said &quot;If I were stranded on a deserted island and the only way to get out is to make a pretty UI, I&#x27;d die&quot;. And dealing with system administration, back end coding, database design and architecture, building any form of end-user interface is not a task for a single man. And while many people are more than happy to jump in and claim a piece of the pie, few people want to put in the effort. It would be fine if people had even minimal skills and willing to put in the effort and learn but I haven&#x27;t met such people yet.<p>The startup culture in Europe is very VERY poor. I&#x27;ve tried several different options. Whether that&#x27;s trying to get people from work or at meetups to join me or even as far as extending my search across the EU online, everything has failed.<p>Let&#x27;s take one of the big projects that I&#x27;ve started, which involves a lot of NLP and speech synthesis. Whenever I show it off to someone, they are instantly interested and wanting to join but their enthusiasm lasts for a week tops and then they go back to meaningless swiping left and right on Tinder or scrolling infinetly on Facebook.<p>And that is my genuine question: How do you find reliable co-founders?","time":1531057280,"title":"Ask HN: How do you find reliable

So I ask HN – is there a software application, existing or ready to be built, which can collate and rank crowd-sourced ideas in novel situations like this? Something with more features than up and down voting platforms.Some features I would propose:<p>1.Crowd review and voting would necessarily help make the ranking of ideas more efficient.\n2.Ranking of ideas by the idea submitters level of expertise, both self and crowd assessed, would be important. \n3.Idea submitters should highlight their level of confidence and potential gaps in their knowledge to aid others to review and or improve upon their idea\n4.Crowd reviewers should be able to evolve or modify the idea. 5.When significant dependencies change, the ideas rank should change or be able to be changed through filtering. E.g. should there be a need to rapidly remove the children, then more rapidly implemented ideas would rank higher.<p>The idea submission could be structured in an online form as below:\n- Idea Title    - Idea Description    - Knowledge Gaps\n- My Expertise&#x2F;Qualifications&#x2F;Highest Level of Achievement in the relevant fields<p>The application would allow annotations on both the idea itself and the knowledge gaps – either to confirm or deny the feasibility of the idea or to evolve the idea and allow the online crowd reviewing the idea to modify according to new information added to the idea. Ranking would incorporate expertise. Such an application may have application in other settings.

Goodcover is building a new home and renters insurance co that tries to fix the insurance incentives by returning any unclaimed premium back to customers, keeping a fee instead.  Goodcover was YC S17, but off the record due to discussions with the CA government.  And we’re still “pre-launch” - starting a new insurance co is hard as it turns out!<p>Part of the technical challenge we deal with is, how do we build software that can scale what an agent does?  Although we can’t offer a full insurance experience yet, we thought we’d roll out an advice app (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.goodcover.com&#x2F;advice\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.goodcover.com&#x2F;advice</a>) that makes a stab at giving advice like an agent might, but using software.  By analyzing your current insurance docs, we can:<p>- Benchmark the coverage you have against what is “normal”.<p>- Provide advice about some specific things that you can fix or at least consider fixing.<p>- Arm you with information on things you can push back on with your insurer.<p>Technically, the way it works is we’ve generalized some gotchas, manually looked over a bunch of Home&#x2F;Renters policies, and built a workflow for us to select where we think you are in the homeowners&#x2F;renters spectrum.  So it’s really just workflow automation, however, it requires obviously being able to translate insurance constructs to user things, but most of it is pretty simple from an automation standpoint.  Most of our time is generally spent on building out insurance functions, but it’s been a great experiment in information hierarchy to try and reduce complex concepts and insurance-speak down to actionable pieces of information for customers.<p>No obligation, and feel free to take our advice back to your current provider and get stuff fixed. Goodcover Insurance Solutions LLC is licensed in California (0M20813) so if you are not in CA we can still have a look, but you should definitely review our advice with a pro in your state.","time":1530811862,"title":"Show HN: Software to give insurance advice like an agent would","type":"story"},{"by":"gballan","descendants":7,"id":17465146,"kids":[17466155,17466411,17465921],"score":38,"time":1530812121,"title":"Pulley Logic Gates (2014) [video]","type":"story","url":"https://vimeo.com/93042377"},{"by":"newyearnewyou","descendants":7,"id":17465064,"kids":[17465276,17471474,17472182,17469396,17465245],"score":11,"text":"I have an idea, which is expensive to concept $150K (it&#x27;s a medical hardware product).<p>My background is pretty average, nothing extraordinary, and I don&#x27;t have a team, but if I can demo the product, I know it will work.","time":1530811449,"title":"Ask HN: How do you raise your first round if you can't afford to demo your idea?","type":"story"},{"by":"GW150914","descendants":32,"id":17465068,"kids":[17465333,17465320,17477576,17465674,17469558,17466192,17466877,17469250,17477002,17468222,17466818,17469882,17466136,17468846,17466216,17465733],"score":206,"time":1530811478,"title":"The Electric Flight of Spiders","type":"story","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/07/the-electric-flight-of-spiders/564437/?single_page=true"},{"by":"Dowwie","descendants":2,"id":17464995,"kids":[17465274,17465008],"score":3,"time":1530811067,"title":"Open-plan offices drive down face-to-face interactions and increase use of email","type":"story","url":"https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/07/05/open-plan-offices-drive-down-face-to-face-interactions-and-increase-use-of-email/#more-34170"},{"by":"Tiktaalik","descendants":31,"id":17465025,"kids":[17465469,17465399,17465337,17465522,17465406,17465402,17465462,17467524,17465550,17465520,17465601,17465047,17465435],"score":34,"time":1530811204,"title":"In 2018, Tumblr Is a Joyless Black Hole","type":"story","url":"https://kotaku.com/in-2018-tumblr-is-a-joyless-black-hole-1827294865"},{"by":"DataPrivacy","descendants":12,"id":17464972,"kids":[17465327,17465180,17465256,17465496,17465560,17465867,17465298],"score":38,"time":1530810927,"title":"Databases 101 for the Non-Database Professional","type":"story","url":"https://thomaslarock.com/2018/07/databases-101/"},{"by":"coloneltcb","descendants":135,"id":17464912,"kids":[17465551,17465418,17465318,17465512,17465291,17465188,17465898,17466015,17466023,17470194,17470357,17465316],"score":116,"time":1530810502,"title":"The App Store turns 10","type":"story","url":"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/07/app-store-turns-10/"},{"by":"OJFord","descendants":47,"id":17464718,"kids":[17465011,17465561,17465200,17465044,17467666,17464905,17470231,17465288,17464934,17465393,17465149,17465263,17465359,17465228,17465376,17465439,17465456,17470714,17466547,17465292,17465797,17465352,17465499,17464863,17465409,17464866,17465108,17465357,17470515,17464865],"score":76,"text":"As a team we have many scripts for doing various internal tasks - domain-specific things, checks for questions like &quot;what&#x27;s in prod?&quot; and &quot;how far along is this commit?&quot;, etc. ad nauseam.<p>The problem is that, with a few exceptions, the person who wrote the script knows it exists and how to use it; and might be around to chime-up with &quot;hey, I wrote a script for that!&quot; when someone has a problem.<p>But discoverability is hard, even if they&#x27;re in the repo not everyone will have seen or reviewed the PR that added them.<p>Does anyone have some good tips to share on how to (or not to) organise such scripts or tools, and allow colleagues to better discover them?","time":1530809015,"title":"Ask HN: How do you organise and discover your team's internal scripts?","type":"story"},{"by":"mikemajzoub","descendants":4,"id":17464637,"kids":[17476872,17478142,17464727,17469445],"score":6,"text":"Hi HN -<p>A new developer can pick up any decent programming book or take any decent online course and reasonably expect to be introduced to many new concepts to chew through.<p>However, as time goes by and the new developer masters the common introductory concepts, such endeavors become less efficient.<p>What strategies do you leverage to overcome this challenge?

Recent news made me think about this problem yet again.<p>I even do have my own domain and an unused mail account for it on a certain popular hosting service (they manage the mail server, I pay shared web hosting), but I&#x27;m not sure if trusting them instead of google is actually a win here. The possibility of someone hacking this host is probably higher than hacking gmail. At least I have a human to talk to if they decide to simply ban me.<p>I also thought about upgrading to a private server instance so I would have my own mail server, but maintaining a mail server seems like a hassle that would eat even more of my free time, and I&#x27;d probably forget an update and be hacked anyway or have my domain accidentally registered in the spam lists.<p>What is your opinion about this? Is there some magical solution where I can just throw some money and feel safe and not worry about having my information being read by third parties or parsed for whatever reason, or getting my account unilaterally banned, or having phone apps reading all my email, etc?<p>Thanks a lot.","time":1530601212,"title":"Ask HN: Low-maintenance alternatives to Gmail?","type":"story"},{"by":"Cieplak","descendants":21,"id":17448007,"kids":[17449558,17448313,17448451,17448310,17449691],"score":63,"time":1530599320,"title":"The Truth About Terahertz (2012)","type":"story","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/military/the-truth-about-terahertz"},{"by":"tdurden","descendants":67,"id":17448089,"kids":[17449983,17448292,17450894,17448436,17448419,17448418,17449372,17451008,17449892,17450274,17449559,17448376,17454292],"score":88,"time":1530600887,"title":"Bare Metal K8s Clustering at Scale","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@cfatechblog/bare-metal-k8s-clustering-at-chick-fil-a-scale-7b0607bd3541"},{"by":"lnguyen","descendants":132,"id":17447987,"kids":[17452224,17453534,17452805,17452602,17452256,17453163,17452474,17454975,17454838,17452193,17452733,17454990,17453115,17481371,17457014,17452348,17453158,17452665,17454285,17452498,17453880,17453448,17453296,17452411,17452288,17453168,17452376,17452123],"score":166,"time":1530599032,"title":"Juggalos figured out how to beat facial recognition","type":"story","url":"https://theoutline.com/post/5172/juggalo-juggalette-facepaint-makeup-hack-beat-facial-recognition-technology"},{"by":"sudo_bangbang","descendants":2,"id":17447914,"kids":[17454668,17448372],"score":16,"time":1530597754,"title":"SICP Goodness – A deep dive into square root procedure","type":"story","url":"https://www.lvguowei.me/post/sicp-goodness-sqrt/"},{"by":"velmu","descendants":109,"id":17448022,"kids":[17448890,17448973,17451543,17448513,17452701,17450034,17449214,17449216,17448494,17450992,17453893,17450142,17449370,17460548,17448999,17451587,17449063,17452952,17449954,17451600,17449333,17450052,17451009,17449890,17449654,17448401],"score":207,"time":1530599601,"title":"What Can I Do About Bufferbloat?","type":"story","url":"https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/bloat/wiki/What_can_I_do_about_Bufferbloat/"},{"by":"mbaye","descendants":157,"id":17447816,"kids":[17448290,17449538,17448143,17448271,17448058,17448212,17448234,17448208,17448302,17448112,17452115,17448561,17448541,17449514,17454335,17450733,17449026,17458374,17449825,17453929,17448460,17454777,17448948,17466930,17448010,17453184,17453769,17492132,17448867,17467291,17471139,17470447,17449207,17450020,17450306,17448488,17448308,17459218,17450544,17448324],"score":484,"time":1530596242,"title":"“Stylish” browser extension steals all your internet history","type":"story","url":"https://robertheaton.com/2018/07/02/stylish-browser-extension-steals-your-internet-history/"},{"by":"arunc","descendants":2,"id":17447444,"kids":[17462032,17448786],"score":9,"time":1530590804,"title":"China brings Star Wars to life with ‘laser AK-47’ that can set fire to targets","type":"story","url":"http://m.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2153310/china-brings-star-wars-life-laser-ak-47-could-set-fire"},{"by":"jepityr","descendants":163,"id":17447439,"kids":[17449458,17448378,17448094,17448932,17448166,17448963,17447876,17449269,17451196,17448195,17448009,17447798,17450077,17451055,17448442,17448037,17449291,17450686,17448453,17449519,17449734,17449585,17449024,17448312,17449693,17452062,17447933,17451636,17448432,17449601,17449312,17452165,17457012,17454683,17448150,17453293,17450440,17450180,17447935],"score":230,"time":1530590761,"title":"The Hidden Cost of Touchscreens","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@caseorganic/why-do-we-keep-building-cars-with-touchscreens-alt-the-hidden-lives-of-touchscreens-55faf92799bf"},{"by":"rakibtg","descendants":6,"id":17447154,"kids":[17454806,17449870,17450742],"score":19,"time":1530587015,"title":"PHP Graphic User Interface Library","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/gabrielrcouto/php-gui"},{"by":"ralston","descendants":9,"id":17447141,"kids":[17449407,17447627,17464280,17447395,17453176,17452168,17451694],"score":8,"text":"I currently have a FT job (thankfully isn&#x27;t too taxing), but I also have several side projects that I&#x27;m working on (browser extension, autonomous trading bot, and just general learning as well).

These free legal services are worth an estimated $15,000 to $30,000 to an early stage company and are performed by top UC Hastings law students working under the supervision of attorneys from prominent law firms, such as Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati, Orrick, Cooley, and Perkins Coie.  We are currently accepting applications for our next session, which will run from August 20th through November 20th.<p>Our program is divided into two modules: Corporate and Patent. In the Corporate Module, the student&#x2F;lawyer teams handle a wide variety of matters including entity formation, intellectual property matters and strategy (trademark and copyright), capitalization tables, and basic contract and personnel issues. On the Patent side, we focus exclusively on patent landscape surveys.  Past clients have come from a variety of industries, including biotech, medical devices, finance, mobile services, payments, gaming, identity protection, bitcoin and fashion.<p>You can learn more about our program here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.startuplegalgarage.org&#x2F;\nand apply here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.startuplegalgarage.org&#x2F;applications&#x2F;<p>Applicants need to have less than $1 million in funding or pre-Series A and a strong tech or biotech component to their business model. They must also be past the “wet-napkin” stage; i.e. have a beta, an MVP, or a product already in market, and be ready to commit time to their legal needs.<p>Applications will close on August 3rd at 5pm.  We will be reviewing applications on a rolling basis as they come in and will begin interviewing founders in late July.  Accepted startups will be assigned to projects by the end of August.\nHave any questions?

I am frequently handed a task that is unclearly defined and I work with the business owner to tease out the spec over time or am expected to come up with the &quot;correct&quot; solution intuitively.  We&#x27;re so small that everybody has too much work to do so I understand the necessity to just hand off the work but because I don&#x27;t deal with clients my &quot;correct&quot; solution on first pass frequently diverges from what the owner &#x2F; stakeholder is thinking.  In addition the work sort of stacks up with the highest priority task being the one that has a client deadline attached or is a flashy &quot;marketing&quot; feature.  There is no clear direction from the owner describing what should go next in the pipeline with a huge list of possible projects both small &amp; large.  The critical stuff is often left for me to work out outside of or in between the other requests but almost never has dedicated time to deal with it.  We don&#x27;t really have the budget to hire another tech person and have tried outsourcing work which resulted in almost exclusively terrible &#x2F; sub-par results (which was partly on us).  I also am not clear I&#x27;m given the tools to succeed in the sense that I feel like in a larger organization a CEO might tell a manager they want X feature and the manager is required to figure it out but they have more access to work out what a &quot;correct&quot; solution is (via access to stakeholder(s)).  I realize there is a lot wrong with this picture and I should probably have already moved on but I&#x27;d like to grow as a person and think this is an opportunity for just that.

So taking a picture and convert the jpg into a pdf is often the best&#x2F;only possible solution. Usually I collect all pictures into one folder and apply image magick convert. The hard part is to find the parameters resulting in the best compromiss between quality and size of the final pdf. Here are the main occuring problems:<p>1) You hardly manage to take the picture perfectly from the top of the document. The result is that your rectangle-shaped A4 document is (in best cases) a trapeze on your picture. A good algorithm should recognize the geometry of the sheet and then stretch it to a rectangle and crop the surroundings. Taking the picture on a dark background, this should not be a big problem. For a possibly curled sheet of a college block, you may also take into acount the crossed lines.<p>2) Brightness&#x2F;Contrast should be adjusted. However it may happen that one part of the document is pictured brighter that another one. By choosing extreme values in brightness&#x2F;contrast parts of the background will turn black and other parts of the letters will vanish to white.<p>This should be easily solvable. The brightness difference from background to letter varies abruptly, while the brightness of the background only varies lightly when moving far across the picture. One should probably apply a contrast adjustment of the gradient of the picture first to iron out these artefacts. Then adjust brightness&#x2F;contrast of the &#x27;ironed&#x27; picture.<p>3) Each picture should be treated individually, because the artefacts coming from points 1) and 2)  may vary between the taken pictures<p>As I will hardly be the first person having this problem, I am asking you for your favourite&#x2F;most convenient solution.

Are there any similar schisms in open-source projects, where the programmers have basically split away from the people who maintain the &quot;.org&quot; website?<p>- Should I donate to country-level organizations (example: Debian France, who only organize Debian conferences in France) or to the american organization?<p>- How to avoid another OpenSSL fiasco, by donating to the right people? Should I just give it all to the FSF, and they take care of trickling the money? Is there an org in charge of spreading the money to the right people?<p>Thank you, I hope you&#x27;ve all met those interrogations about donating.","time":1530525040,"title":"Ask HN: How to fund the correct open-source organizations?","type":"story"},{"by":"paufernandez","descendants":16,"id":17440418,"kids":[17452438,17449644,17449566,17451554],"score":98,"time":1530524750,"title":"Adversarial Reprogramming of Neural Networks","type":"story","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.11146"},{"by":"fanf2","descendants":41,"id":17440404,"kids":[17453008,17453195,17451080,17452912,17454032,17453265,17451397,17450710,17451036,17453811,17451235,17454164,17451736],"score":113,"time":1530524584,"title":"How open is too open?","type":"story","url":"http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2018-how-open-is-too-open.html"},{"by":"altsyset","descendants":2,"id":17440385,"kids":[17440397,17441618],"score":2,"text":"I am visiting Sophia the robot today, but I have been wondering if she has any unique skills?

One is because they&#x27;re a web agency and not really set to be a huge company.

As part of our rapid response to this incident, our team took a variety of measures to ensure the ongoing security of your data. Because each customer’s typeforms are different, the data downloaded during this incident will vary by customer. You may want to communicate with your respondents to inform them of this incident. Please see the Q&amp;A below for more info about this.<p>In addition to the steps taken to date, our team have launched a comprehensive review of our system security to identify ways we can further increase our security measures to prevent future incidents.

They accepted me! I could not have been more excited, this company was everything I had wanted.<p>Except now I&#x27;m here. A lot of stuff is a mess. There is technical debt everywhere. Undocumented code bases that haven&#x27;t been touched in years and maddening internal processes.

We&#x27;ve built a corporate credit card for startups that has high limits, an instant online application and no personal guarantees.<p>Pedro and I built our first payments business in Brazil, Pagar.me, when we were teenagers. We came to the U.S. to attend Stanford. We joined YC W17 and realized quickly – even with a seed round in the millions – that we could not get a corporate credit card. We are Brazilian, young, and do not have U.S. credit. Even if we did have credit – we know that personally guaranteeing a credit card makes no sense for a business (more on that later).<p>In Brazil, we raised $300K initially (when we were 16) from an investor that was willing to take a chance on us. In Brazil, even though there are 200 million people, there is very little venture capital financing and limited startup infrastructure (accelerators, resources, technical talent, executives experienced with high growth). We knew that $300K was all we were getting, so we had to find a business that could be cash flow positive quickly. It was easier to do that accepting payments online (which naturally generates cash), but it was an operational challenge for sure. We were able to grow quickly in Brazil because we hit the market at the right time, as ecommerce was transitioning to online payments and because we, better than any of the foreign competitors, understood the nuance of Brazil. Specifically on that point, in Brazil the consumer has the option to pay for any card transaction in installments, and that requires a cash outflow for the merchant. Pagar.me figured out how to productize that best to the online market there.<p>When we got to the U.S., we assumed that the payments system here would be significantly more mature and sophisticated than it was in Brazil, however that was not the case. Particularly on the issuing side (banks extending credit cards), there has been very little innovation or using technology to innovate on features. That is how Brex was born. Over the past year we’ve been incubating and improving and just launched with an online self-signup that lets you get access to a virtual card in minutes. We waited to launch until we had this feature, as we know how much of a pain it is to go through the back and forth of online and paper-based applications. Brex underwrites by connecting directly with your bank account, which means we can offer higher limits than other cards, often 10x-20x more.<p>From a software perspective, we rebuilt all of the payments tech from scratch, which we learned how to do in our last business. Even then, to build Brex it was still grueling having to deal with the obscure regulations surrounding Know Your Customer (KYC), heavy oversight from banking partners, and complexities associated with interacting directly with Visa. In doing so, we built awesome features like instant virtual cards issued to you and your team and we solved something this time that has been bugging us forever – the fact that you can never tell what a credit card charge is on your statement! We changed the data to give you the actual merchant &#x2F; vendor and a link to the website. When we did this, we also realized we could do something really unique with receipts – because we know the actual vendor &#x2F; merchant, we can match any receipt sent to us via SMS or email to your transaction immediately. No need to save receipts or deal with other integrations that have a huge delay between matching a receipt to a transaction, we do it in real time.<p>Interestingly, from a technical standpoint, we did all this in Elixir. We thought it would be a good choice (and so far we are happy with our decision) because of the distributed nature of the systems that we built and we could rely on the Erlang VM to provide that infrastructure out-of-the-box. Our domain knowledge from Pagar.me allowed us to anticipate the system boundaries and therefore we could build our backend as a distributed system from day one. \nAnother unusual feature about the Brex launch is that we are launching relatively late in our history and with a pretty significant amount of capital from our Series B. We launched the business at YC, but based on our background with Pagar.me and that we were focused on payments again, we raised a ~$7M seed round in Spring 2017. That round was led by Ribbit Capital – which we liked given our connection to Micky there and their expertise in Fintech. YC Continuity led our Series B. In both rounds, for us, it’s all about the relationship with the partner and firm, and we have been huge beneficiaries of the YC ecosystem.<p>On a personal note, for us the non-personal guarantee aspect of our product is most salient. As I mentioned, we are foreign entrepreneurs who don’t have access to banking products in the U.S. It was demoralizing to come to the U.S. after being successful in Brazil and not be able to get a card – especially given how much activity, particularly online, requires a credit card. Personal guarantees mean an entrepreneur who has already taken a ton of risk has to further put their personal financials on the line, which even if the company pays on time, can hurt his or her credit.<p>One aspect of the product that we’d love HN feedback on is the signup flow. We gathered great feedback from our beta, and we waited to launch until we had an instant signup product. In financial services, signup flows have meaningfully more constraints than do many consumer signup flows – particularly compared to those with freemium models. For example, we need to collect business information to comply with regulations around anti-money laundering and Know Your Customer standards, as well as ensure the customer’s ability to pay and set up autopay. These constraints mean not only a longer signup flow, but also one that integrates many third party vendors to do compliance, fraud and credit checks. The more integrations and data to handle, the more edge cases we need to be able to support seamlessly. It took a ton of engineering effort to get here, plus a lot of time enhancing our compliance processes and credit framework. In light of those constraints, we’re specifically looking for user feedback on whether or not the flow feels logical, intuitive and simple – and if there are adjustments to the order, text or design that could improve the UI. But we&#x27;re interested to hear any of your ideas and experiences and discuss the Fintech space generally too. Thanks for taking the time to read this, we’re really happy to be posting here :)<p>Henrique and Pedro","time":1530206630,"title":"Launch HN: Brex (YC W17) – Corporate Credit Card for Startups","type":"story"},{"by":"johnomarkid","descendants":23,"id":17418805,"kids":[17423011,17420489,17421750,17420668,17421237],"score":28,"time":1530206553,"title":"Bird has officially raised a whopping $300M as the scooter wars heat up","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/28/bird-has-officially-raised-a-whopping-300m-as-the-scooter-wars-heat-up/"},{"by":"eaguyhn","dead":true,"id":17418775,"kids":[17419289,17419377],"score":10,"time":1530206371,"title":"JavaScript is for Girls","type":"story","url":"https://logicmag.io/01-javascript-is-for-girls/"},{"by":"maxwellpower","descendants":8,"id":17418665,"kids":[17419100,17419173],"score":27,"time":1530205599,"title":"ProtonMail DDoS Attacks Are a Case Study of What Happens When You Mock Attackers","type":"story","url":"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/protonmail-ddos-attacks-are-a-case-study-of-what-happens-when-you-mock-attackers/"},{"by":"JulienRbrt","descendants":10,"id":17418633,"kids":[17418683,17421897,17420665,17419202,17419003,17430958,17429594,17429691],"score":11,"time":1530205451,"title":"Ask HN: Why would you choose a certified self-taught candidate over a graduated?","type":"story"},{"by":"moonka","descendants":143,"id":17418649,"kids":[17420143,17419492,17419767,17419991,17420065,17420046,17421764,17420764,17422194,17419530,17419666,17422638],"score":247,"time":1530205533,"title":"Former Equifax Manager Charged with Insider Trading","type":"story","url":"https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-115"},{"by":"mrzool","descendants":335,"id":17418645,"kids":[17420566,17419440,17419181,17419871,17420747,17419634,17419401,17419643,17419410,17420658,17419769,17419532,17420387,17423110,17424702,17419476,17421351,17420744,17419994,17419451,17419112,17420151],"score":380,"time":1530205515,"title":"We Should Be Building Cities for People, Not Cars (2016)","type":"story","url":"http://devonzuegel.com/post/we-should-be-building-cities-for-people-not-cars"},{"by":"seshagiric","descendants":72,"id":17418598,"kids":[17423137,17432775,17433193,17434473,17434449,17435091,17433185,17433692,17433144],"score":405,"time":1530205152,"title":"Microsoft Releases 125M Building Footprints in the US as Open Data","type":"story","url":"https://blogs.bing.com/maps/2018-06/microsoft-releases-125-million-building-footprints-in-the-us-as-open-data?PC=EMMX01"},{"by":"jonbaer","descendants":2,"id":17418262,"kids":[17420739,17420028],"score":6,"time":1530203128,"title":"America’s severe trucker shortage could undermine the prosperous economy","type":"story","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/americas-severe-trucker-shortage-could-undermine-the-prosperous-economy/2018/06/28/61c19e12-7595-11e8-b4b7-308400242c2e_story.html"},{"by":"jeffreyrogers","descendants":2,"id":17418135,"kids":[17418901,17418921],"score":17,"time":1530202323,"title":"Politics Isn't About Policy","type":"story","url":"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/09/politics-isnt-a.html"},{"by":"cdnsteve","descendants":21,"id":17418097,"kids":[17418370,17419499,17418242,17419277,17436516,17419584,17420004,17419786,17418309,17423918,17423027,17418225,17419896,17421291,17419632,17429386,17418249,17419008],"score":23,"text":"Looking for feedback for resources and ideas on how to ease my son into coding.

I believe I have then suffer with some level of depression.<p>As retrospective, I:<p>* failed at properly documenting the architecture<p>* failed at properly setting up the dev env so that the other developers can run their instances of the solution locally<p>* dwelled too much time to achieve the above point<p>* dwelled too much time to automate things, especially at trying to automate dev, staging, production setup<p>* failed to look at minor details (I need help with this, I&#x27;m a big picture guy, never the details)<p>* should have sticked to SDK provided by third party, instead I chose to go with something totally new to me just because the SDK is only available with COM Interop and I do not have any Windows machine with me.<p>I believe I have the knowledge, and not afraid of looking for the knowledge and the &quot;proper&quot; ways of things should be done. And maybe trying too hard.<p>Back to the topic, what makes a good solution architect, how can I improve myself?","time":1530174238,"title":"Ask HN: What makes a good solution architect?","type":"story"},{"by":"gaddafirusli","descendants":36,"id":17414961,"kids":[17416290,17414965,17415351,17415345,17434619,17415488,17417075,17427147,17468533,17416337,17440888,17415362,17415779],"score":146,"time":1530173078,"title":"Show HN: Shotsnapp – Create beautiful device mockup presentation","type":"story","url":"https://shotsnapp.com/"},{"by":"anacleto","descendants":49,"id":17414884,"kids":[17423768,17423596,17422764,17423416,17422382,17422655,17423152,17423335,17423440,17425092,17423720,17423078],"score":99,"time":1530172191,"title":"Reasoning, and What It Is To Be Rational (2000)","type":"story","url":"http://www.akat.com/reasoning.htm"},{"by":"atlet","descendants":7,"id":17414841,"kids":[17415118,17420515,17415215],"score":17,"time":1530171659,"title":"Entrepreneurs who lost absolutely everything.

After years of freelancing, I’ve found myself with a job offer from a unicorn in SF. It&#x27;s a prestigious company; few get in. My hunch is that it would be foolish not to pursue, but there are lingering questions that I’d love to talk through.<p>To list the obvious pros: the pay is great… the team is smart, diverse, friendly… the tech will touch many people… the subject is one I’ve been interested in… and the company will be a badge of honor on my resume. Relocation isn’t a problem.<p>But, I’ve been immersed in 1-off projects for 3+ years now, mostly centered on web, UX, front-end. It seems this new job will be low-level, CS-heavy, and involve major architectural decisions. I have a CS degree and I&#x27;m confident that I can learn on the job, but I’m worried that my relative lack of experience in these areas (plus corporate experience in general) will make me a slow starter. Can systems design be picked up over months? Is it easy to adjust to an office when you&#x27;ve never had a meeting or even asked for help for years? The last thing I’d want is to disappoint my team.<p>I’m also concerned about the policy wrt personal projects. Nothing you code outside work is cleared for public release. Normally this would be a nonstarter, but the rest of the job is so good that I have to consider it. On a pro level, I fear my skills will stagnate if I can’t build cool stuff for others to enjoy. On a personal level, it feels <i>wrong</i> that the company will own my entire output. There’s a chance I’ll feel chronically depressed over it.<p>Finally, I’m not sure how to switch my thinking from «free indie dev» to «corporate worker». I’m very interested in the job, but I’ve defined myself as a free spirit over the past few years, working out of cafes and building stuff that tickles my fancy. How do I transition without feeling crappy or losing myself?<p>Have any of you had to deal with these kinds of questions? Would appreciate advice.

I’m Deepak, founder of The Lobby, from YC’s W18 batch. We’re building a marketplace where you can buy mock interviews, resume reviews, and coaching calls from company insiders, starting with top finance roles. (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelobby.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelobby.io&#x2F;</a>)<p>I went to a school where the big banks, consulting shops, and tech companies didn’t come to recruit on campus. As a result, it was really hard not only to get interviews and job offers, but also to figure out what these companies were looking for in candidates in the first place.<p>I got lucky and landed jobs at big banks and it was always because I somehow found someone on the inside who was willing to coach and mentor me in a very personalized way. I used that experience to help 50+ friends from similar backgrounds land jobs at top firms, and that’s what inspired the idea for The Lobby.<p>We have some incredibly happy users who’ve already landed jobs, and a very high repeat purchase rate both amongst students and career switchers because of the value in speaking to people in the specific teams and companies they&#x27;re interested in vs. generic company-wide advice.<p>It has, however, been challenging to get everyone receptive to our new approach. Even though people spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on college (to ultimately land a good job), it&#x27;s controversial to build a recruiting-focused company that charges job seekers instead of just the companies.<p>We’ve had 2 schools buy packages of calls where they subsidize the costs for their students, and are thinking through ideas to pass the cost away from students, even though this service is not just meant for college (our best users are career switchers). We’ve also received a lot of interest from companies who are interested in getting access to our best-rated candidates because they’ve been pre-screened by real humans who’ve done the job, vs. recruiters who have not.<p>Any feedback and ideas from the HN community on how to convey the cost&#x2F;benefit of what we’re offering to students, recent grads, career switchers, parents, and even schools is much appreciated.","time":1530120231,"title":"Launch HN: The  Lobby (YC W18) – 1-on-1 calls with company insiders to get hired","type":"story"},{"by":"superasn","descendants":2,"id":17410024,"kids":[17410086,17410066],"score":4,"time":1530120209,"title":"Ask HN: Which tech “currently under development only” you're most excited about?","type":"story"},{"by":"yani","descendants":6,"id":17409931,"kids":[17409980,17410909],"score":2,"text":"The first place that I go when there is an outage is the status page of the service.

The supporters of &quot;tools-first&quot; argue that we are teaching biologists, not software developers. They like to teach the specific tools (languages, libraries, functions, etc.) that our students are actually going to need as quickly as possible. To cover as much ground as possible, they are willing to sacrifice a deeper understanding of programming.<p>The &quot;fundamentals-first&quot; faction would prefer to do it the other way around: instead of teaching a load of commands to learn by heart, they would rather take more time to develop a programming mindset. They are willing to sacrifice how much content course participants learn, if it means that they learn how to program properly and fully understand how a given language works (with its variables, functions, scoping, etc.). Their argument is that once you have understood the concept, teaching yourself the content is easy (GIYF); whereas the reverse is much harder.<p>What do you think?

WAYFAIR, INC., ET AL., the Court overturned its earlier precedent and decided that doing online business in a state that you have no presence in can be enough to establish a nexus. The exact parameters of this are yet to be determined, other than it will probably require that the revenue or number of transactions you do in the state must be above some threshold to establish a nexus.<p>Will this loosened standard for what can establish a nexus only apply to taxes between states, or is this the new standard for all inquiries a to the existence of a nexus? If so, does that mean it will now be easier to establish that a foreign court had personal jurisdiction, and so easier to get foreign judgments enforced in the US?<p>There are some categorical limits on foreign judgments. For example tax and penal judgments will not be enforced by US courts. I do not know if GDPR fines fall under any of the forbidden categories.<p>If they do, a US GDPR transgressor still might not be safe, because GDPR also allows the data subjects themselves to sue for compensation, and foreign judgments for compensation are usually allowable I believe.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com&#x2F;0-619-6072","time":1529882808,"title":"Ask HN: Supreme Court sales tax ruling GDPR implications?","type":"story"},{"by":"vezycash","descendants":18,"id":17388928,"kids":[17389310,17389347,17389328],"score":27,"time":1529882716,"title":"Changes in WebAssembly Could Render Meltdown and Spectre Browser Patches Useless","type":"story","url":"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/changes-in-webassembly-could-render-meltdown-and-spectre-browser-patches-useless/"},{"by":"marijnz","descendants":20,"id":17388908,"kids":[17391877,17392018,17393495,17391439,17391515,17389489,17389366],"score":55,"time":1529882369,"title":"Show HN: UnityShell, a “shell” for the Unity Editor","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/marijnz/unity-shell"},{"by":"viabary","descendants":5,"id":17388878,"kids":[17388991,17388904,17389189],"score":4,"text":"Got an update fr Google 2 days ago, I did not make the cut for the final round of F2F interviews (Product Manager role).

I do hardware&#x2F;firmware design professionally but i dabble with software and machine learning as a hobby.<p>I liked the courses where math was a huge focus because it allowed me to understand from first principles.<p>When i took the Udacity course it was just learning the tensorflow library for the most of it.

say that &quot;Team Brazil won the World Cup five times.&quot; This sentence is grammatically correct but it does not make sense. Who or what won the cup five times? For instance, the team who won the 1958 cup is totally different than the team who won the 2002 cup. A different team of players constituting the Team Brasil won each Cup. There are two things that remained constant: team&#x27;s badge and its colors. But neither the badge nor the colors went in the field and played the game!<p>Since the elements who actually played the games and won the Cup, the players, were different, the correct sentence may be: &quot;The Team Brazil badge won the World Cup five times.&quot; But that&#x27;s absurd because the badge had no effect in winning the Cups. Different players played and different teams won the Cup. We should say, &quot;a different team won one Cup each and this happened five times.&quot;<p>This appears to be similar to Xeno&#x27;s Paradox, that is, a paradox about the assumption of continuity. This is actualy true for every similar statement assuming continuity because we know, by Heraclitus, that &quot;one cannot cross the same river twice.&quot; The only constant is the change.<p>In some cases, the change occurs so slowly, so gradually and imperceptibly that we have no difficulty assuming that the subject stays constant. So we normally assume that a co-worker who comes to the office every morning is the same person even though he always changes in some ways. But in the case of Team Brazil we know that the entire team changed. This is like Lincoln&#x27;s axe problem: Is it still Lincoln&#x27;s axe if the metal and the handle had been changed along the way? No. That&#x27;s a different axe now.<p>Similarly, the team who won the 1958 Cup and the 2002 Cup are two completely different teams. The two teams have the badge as common but the badge did not play the games and had no influence in winning the Cups. This seems like a paradox to me. Do you agree?

All this data is spread out, and finding it pushes you down a rabbit hole of AngelList, personal websites, Crunchbase, and VC fund portfolio pages. All this can take hundreds of hours of research––hours you could be using to <i>actually</i> close rounds.<p>For the last few years while we’ve been fundraising for different projects, we&#x27;ve built out spreadsheets of all the investors we’ve met with (and who we’d want to meet) complete with data like where to best contact them.

I started\nout as a kid on a Heathkit 8-bit computer and now work for a research\norganization doing Python, JavaScript (w&#x2F; TypeScript), and I build\nsingle-page web apps using React as well as backend data processing\napps in Python using NumPy, Pandas, etc. I&#x27;ve always kept up because\nI&#x27;ve always been curious about how things work and I enjoy what I do.<p>But I have an ever-growing feeling that &#x27;the whole thing&#x27; is just too\ncomplex and has too many security holes. Yesterday I found that\nthe Slack app on my Linux machine was using 670MB of memory. And\nChrome with two tabs open, one on Office 365 and the other on JIRA,\nwas taking 850MB. Keeping an eye on CVEs and other security and\nprivacy related issues is enough to make me realize how fragile the\nwhole thing is.<p>I know there is amazing engineering in most of the tools we use, I\ndon&#x27;t want to diminish that. But maybe we&#x27;ve &quot;dug too deep, too fast?&quot;\nI miss the days of being able to read K&amp;R from cover-to-cover and\nbeing able to understand what my programs are doing.<p>So my question: what career paths exist for someone who wants to\n&quot;get back to their roots?&quot; I.e., what might I do to work in an area of\nsoftware that is simpler, closer to the machine, and one which isn&#x27;t\nbuilt on so many layers of abstraction?

Specifically, I care about the following tasks:<p>1. Active engagement: while consuming a piece of knowledge, I want to write down my thoughts&#x2F;reactions with as little friction as possible. For visual knowledge (web pages and PDFs), I want to annotate my thoughts inline (preferably with support for stylus input).<p>2. Summarization: after finishing a piece, I want to review my annotations and pick out the important ones, as well as potentially write a standalone summary of the piece. I also want to categorize the piece via tags.<p>3. Linking: I want to be able to provide different kinds of links between knowledge pieces, either implicitly (e.g. by providing the same tag) or explicitly (e.g. &quot;this web page is the HN comment section for this article&quot;). When writing comments, I should be able to write down internal hyperlinks to any knowledge piece in my collection.<p>4. Contextualization: I want to compare&#x2F;contrast the main points of the article with linked articles. I should be able to easily search along every dimension of my data cube (e.g. all articles from source X, all articles about topic Y, etc.) to produce different contexts.<p>For lack of a true memex, my question is: what tools do you use today to accomplish these tasks? From my experience, almost everyone has a different ad-hoc setup, so I&#x27;m curious to understand the diversity in HN&#x27;s community. I&#x27;ve seen people use tools like Evernote, Scrivener, or even a custom MediaWiki to perform a subset of these tasks, but I&#x27;ve never seen a complete toolchain.<p>I&#x27;m also interested in perspectives on: should this problem be approached in Unix fashion (each task deserves a single tool that does it well?) or in Emacs fashion (the entire toolchain needs a single, over-arching, opinionated framework for maximum integration)?","time":1529348411,"title":"Ask HN: What is your knowledge toolchain in 2018?","type":"story"},{"by":"jasonkostempski","descendants":6,"id":17340747,"kids":[17340821,17344276,17345554],"score":54,"time":1529348342,"title":"Free software is at risk in the EU","type":"story","url":"https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/free-software-is-at-risk-in-the-eu-take-action-now"},{"by":"jasondavies","descendants":11,"id":17340686,"kids":[17341743,17343382,17342799,17344683],"score":60,"time":1529347919,"title":"Who needs a CPU?

I&#x27;ve been looking into various modern languages and have been working in few of them. While new kids like Golang, Rust, Kotlin, Crystal, and Elixir are getting great traction in today&#x27;s world of writing business oriented web applications, something that was designed to be expressive is not getting enough traction. There are no mainstream languages that are inspiring their syntax from COBOL (like Elixir or Crystal did).

Currently React has the most usage with Vue having the greatest momentum. These can contribute to choosing one or the other but not based on that alone.<p>I use React at work and Vue at home. I would choose Vue at work for new projects because the work projects are relatively simple and developed by small (~3 person) teams. The main thing I appreciate about Vue is the low cost of creating, reusing, and maintaining components. In particular, I prefer having local state and parent&lt;-&gt;child communication with network requests being made at the deepest level that makes sense which makes for much looser coupling.<p>I see the advantage of React being the number of available developers and the use of PropTypes adding stability in larger projects and teams. One thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that full-on React has a higher learning curve which tends to put off our mobile and back-end devs from detracting them from productive full-stack development. I think Vue would do better here, but that has yet to be tested.<p>Other frameworks I&#x27;d like to get some exposure and real-world experience using are Elm, ReactReason, and possibly TypeScript or PureScript in combination with some framework.

If they walked away it would not prevent their competition, but would at least give us something for our time spent on the deal.","time":1528818367,"title":"Ask HN: Ask for earnest money with offer?","type":"story"},{"by":"rusher81572","descendants":2,"id":17294086,"kids":[17294612,17294923],"score":22,"time":1528816801,"title":"How Scylla Leverages Control Theory to Keep Compactions Under Control","type":"story","url":"https://www.scylladb.com/2018/06/12/scylla-leverages-control-theory/"},{"by":"shacharz","descendants":52,"id":17294147,"kids":[17294797,17294965,17295341,17294525,17294467,17295067,17295324,17295300,17294953,17294417,17295139],"score":48,"time":1528817087,"title":"Avoid FIFA World Cup CDN Issues","type":"story","url":"https://blog.peer5.com/avoid-cdn-issues-at-peak/"},{"by":"raleighm","descendants":87,"id":17293702,"kids":[17294441,17294316,17295166,17294656,17294292,17294432,17300431,17295211,17294275,17295250,17294299,17294376,17294372,17300440,17294317,17294464,17296612,17294287,17294521,17294183,17294421],"score":26,"time":1528814721,"title":"If the Robots Come for Our Jobs, What Should the Government Do?","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/upshot/if-the-robots-come-for-our-jobs-what-should-the-government-do.html"},{"by":"peeze","descendants":70,"id":17293598,"kids":[17296586,17294840,17296245,17297405,17297055,17294776,17298614,17298616,17295823,17295565,17297555,17295330,17297414,17299300,17298118,17297718,17297167,17295588,17295018],"score":183,"time":1528814030,"title":"Vice Media: A Company Built on a Bluff","type":"story","url":"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/06/inside-vice-media-shane-smith.html"},{"by":"ilamont","descendants":269,"id":17293571,"kids":[17295253,17295646,17296345,17295303,17293887,17294209,17294322,17294193,17295319,17295125,17294526,17296278,17293931,17294240,17295106,17297562,17294055,17299847,17294618,17299870,17294591,17294119,17294633],"score":101,"time":1528813904,"title":"Scooter startup Bird is seeking a $2B valuation","type":"story","url":"https://www.axios.com/scooter-startup-bird-is-seeking-a-2-billion-valuation-1528813078-11187061-2a49-440c-a2e6-65e74faad5ec.html"},{"by":"dsr12","descendants":41,"id":17293361,"kids":[17293980,17293981,17293989,17293955,17293902,17294025,17293910],"score":44,"time":1528812526,"title":"JeffBezos Is Already $40B Richer This Year–While Typical Amazon Worker Made $12K","type":"story","url":"http://time.com/money/5301812/jeff-bezos-net-worth-2018-amazon-worker-salary/"},{"by":"SlightRespect","descendants":2,"id":17293296,"kids":[17308024,17298340],"score":6,"text":"My company bought each team member dual monitors and told us to work from home 3 days a week.

When I joined YC, one of the things\nthat I most wanted to do was to help make hiring and getting hired\nsuck less. I have a business reason and a personal reason for this.\nThe business reason is that YC&#x27;s job is to help the startups we fund,\nand helping with hiring is one of the biggest things we can do. The\npersonal reason is that before I joined YC, I did a lot of hiring for\nmy startup, Scribd, and for me it was the most rewarding part of\nstarting a company. Some of the people who joined us had life-changing\nexperiences - they moved across the world, jump-started a new career, \ngrew with the company and became leaders, or used their experience \nto start their own successful companies. I wanted to help more people \nhave those experiences and not feel stuck in jobs where they don&#x27;t \nhave much impact.<p>So, a few of us at YC have been building Work at a Startup\n(<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.workatastartup.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.workatastartup.com&#x2F;</a>), with the goal of making it easier for startups\nto hire, and engineers to get hired, at a YC company. We started with\nthe same insight that everyone else has: the hiring process is broken\nand inefficient, and decided to look for ways we could make it \nbetter for everyone, at least within the YC ecosystem. For example,\nwe could get rid of the burden for applicants of having to send a\nresume and cover letter to every company by creating a simple way to\napply to all YC companies at once.<p>While working on this, though, and talking to engineers and HN users\nabout it, I realized that there&#x27;s a more fundamental question: why\nshould people want to work (or not!) at a startup in the first place?\nThis question has a history and has gone through several phases. In\nthe early heyday of YC and HN and pg essays there was a ton of\nenthusiasm about startups, the freedom and creativity and opportunity\nthey offer. In more recent years, when I read HN threads (like\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=15916350\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=15916350</a>, to pick one close to\nhome), it&#x27;s common to see people arguing that, for early employees,\njoining a startup isn&#x27;t such a good idea. And frankly, some of their\npoints are good ones. There are issues that need to be fixed. One of\nthe big things that YC did in the early days was move the needle in\nfavor of founders. That was an adjustment that badly needed to happen,\nand it did happen. I think the next phase is to move the needle in\nfavor of early employees. Just how to do this is one question I&#x27;m\nhoping we can discuss in this thread.<p>So, HN: what are the pros and cons of joining a startup in 2018,\nparticularly as an early employee? And where there are cons, what\nwould fix them? If there are concrete ways we can find to shift the\nbalance, YC is interested in doing that.","time":1528741514,"title":"Ask HN: Pros and cons of working at a startup in 2018?","type":"story"},{"by":"domargan","descendants":31,"id":17286935,"kids":[17290814,17287876,17288523,17291654,17291912,17390610,17287526,17287759,17287440,17291850,17287767],"score":129,"time":1528741504,"title":"Do We Need Distributed Stream Processing?","type":"story","url":"https://lsds.doc.ic.ac.uk/blog/do-we-need-distributed-stream-processing"},{"by":"windows_tips","descendants":8,"id":17286908,"kids":[17287073,17287036],"score":2,"time":1528741358,"title":"Ask HN: Will HN have to stop shadowbanning and banning if NN is passed?","type":"story"},{"by":"gdb","descendants":18,"id":17286810,"kids":[17288320,17287452,17291349,17291034,17288212,17290182,17287653],"score":191,"time":1528740752,"title":"Improving Language Understanding with Unsupervised Learning","type":"story","url":"https://blog.openai.com/language-unsupervised/"},{"by":"typpo","descendants":59,"id":17286770,"kids":[17286973,17287456,17287396,17288137,17288714,17287174,17288383,17287407,17291849,17291776,17288265,17287838,17287662,17287864,17288814,17287099,17288153,17288084,17289769,17287892,17288178,17288819,17292435,17287399,17368373,17368363,17291561,17297661,17368375,17288203],"score":384,"time":1528740438,"title":"Show HN: Plot modern addresses on Earth 240M years ago","type":"story","url":"http://dinosaurpictures.org/ancient-earth"},{"by":"dsr12","descendants":105,"id":17286760,"kids":[17286895,17286872,17286829,17290642,17288058,17287053,17286892,17287627,17286992,17288721,17287193,17286978,17286873,17286919,17287029,17286865,17288916,17290051,17287157,17286876],"score":114,"time":1528740324,"title":"Domino's Pizza unveils U.S. infrastructure project filling potholes","type":"story","url":"https://www.pavingforpizza.com/"},{"by":"kqr2","descendants":15,"id":17286754,"kids":[17291372,17288594,17288867,17288640,17290415,17290207],"score":46,"time":1528740297,"title":"Lang5 – A Stack-Based Array Language","type":"story","url":"http://lang5.sourceforge.net/tiki-index.php"},{"by":"jeffreyrogers","descendants":12,"id":17286689,"kids":[17286771,17287771,17286959,17287125,17287666,17308435,17287165,17290237,17294579],"score":9,"time":1528739793,"title":"Why Can't We Hate Men?","type":"story","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-cant-we-hate-men/2018/06/08/f1a3a8e0-6451-11e8-a69c-b944de66d9e7_story.html"},{"by":"how-about-this","descendants":3,"id":17286844,"kids":[17293158,17289477,17288864],"score":16,"time":1528740948,"title":"A People’s Historian: John Julius Norwich, 1929-2018","type":"story","url":"https://www.weeklystandard.com/dominic-green/a-peoples-historian"},{"by":"stealthmodeclan","descendants":5,"id":17286845,"kids":[17287019,17288888,17286864],"score":4,"text":"It&#x27;s 2018 and we still have mosquitoes.

If so, I’d be curious to hear your thoughts on the industry. I’ve been working as a CPU designer for several years and as I’ve watched the growth of the tech sector during this time, I can’t help but wonder if I should switch to software engineering. My reasons are:<p>1. Limited choice of employers and cities – The semiconductor industry has been consolidating over the last several years, and the trend seems likely to continue. Consequently, there are currently only a handful of tech giants designing ICs. Jobs seem limited to a few major cities. SWE jobs can be found in most large cities across a range of company sizes.<p>2. Lack of startup&#x2F;solo opportunities – SWE seems to offer many opportunities to found&#x2F;join a startup or work as an independent contractor. CPU design seems to have far fewer of these opportunities, likely due to the much higher capital requirements. Will the tech sector’s current interest in AI&#x2F;ML lead to many more startups in CPU design, as it has done for software design?<p>3. Lack of community – A search on Meetup reveals many software-related groups in my city. No such groups seem to exist for CPU design, likely due to its closed-source nature. Many free resources exist to learn the basics of coding, but learning CPU design using free tools is not as straightforward. Additionally, there seems to be little incentive to design and fabricate an open-source CPU when cheap ones can already be purchased, whereas there are many motivations for creating open-source software.<p>4. Compensation – I would certainly not describe CPU designers’ compensation as poor, but I’ve never read&#x2F;heard about anyone outside of executives receiving annual stock grants that exceed their base salary, whereas such things seem common for SWE’s at the largest tech companies.<p>Are my points above incorrect, &quot;grass is greener&quot; observations, or does SWE have much better career prospects than CPU design?","time":1528729491,"title":"Ask HN: Are there any other CPU designers here?","type":"story"},{"by":"rrauenza","descendants":101,"id":17284770,"kids":[17286023,17285810,17285897,17285426,17285573,17286170,17285767,17285319,17285726,17285356],"score":50,"time":1528729113,"title":"A Stampede of Meatless Products Overrun Grocery Store Meat Cases","type":"story","url":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-stampede-of-meatless-products-overrun-grocery-store-meat-cases-1528653236"},{"by":"fowkswe","descendants":3,"id":17284668,"kids":[17285773,17286199,17285432],"score":15,"time":1528728464,"title":"Elon Musk says the first 'full self-driving features' are coming in August","type":"story","url":"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1005782088841232385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd-28081985871191391734.ampproject.net%2F1528391646530%2Fframe.html"},{"by":"mkovji","descendants":78,"id":17284579,"kids":[17285533,17286090,17285529,17285900,17286037,17285920,17287482,17285886,17285307,17285733,17285833,17288422,17285784,17288417,17297560,17288976,17285458,17285123,17286284,17309637,17285507,17285504,17285454,17287986,17285334,17285450,17285335],"score":68,"time":1528727949,"title":"Ask HN: How do billionaires deal with their anxiety?","type":"story"},{"by":"jasonli","descendants":3,"id":17284699,"kids":[17285346,17284905],"score":1,"text":"Hey everyone,<p>I&#x27;m a designer who runs a small studio.<p>I&#x27;m thinking about starting a blog series about &quot;design for non-designers&quot;.

Am I thinking along the correct lines.<p>Obviously data will be stored on external locations and probably cloud as well.","time":1528451707,"title":"Ask HN: How do you backup/restore/repair your windows machine?","type":"story"},{"by":"slsniffer","descendants":5,"id":17263809,"kids":[17263827,17265998,17265970],"score":3,"time":1528449639,"title":"Show HN: CloudTiming: Cut up to 60% on the cost of cloud servers","type":"story","url":"https://cloudtiming.com"},{"by":"deadcoder0904","descendants":132,"id":17263891,"kids":[17264975,17264840,17265231,17264856,17264841,17265339,17265595,17265794,17265650,17266474,17266003,17265925,17270905,17265549,17265554,17264282,17265680,17265644,17269620,17264927,17264697,17265249,17264844],"score":161,"time":1528450699,"title":"Microsoft Buys GitHub: The Linux Foundation's Reaction","type":"story","url":"https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/microsoft-buys-github-the-linux-foundations-reaction/"},{"by":"buserror","descendants":120,"id":17263651,"kids":[17263905,17263990,17263877,17264281,17263779,17264193,17263970,17264880,17264445,17263799,17264025,17263977,17264016,17263981,17263995],"score":335,"time":1528447440,"title":"Intel: We 'Forgot' to Mention 28-Core, 5-GHz CPU Demo Was Overclocked","type":"story","url":"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-28-core-cpu-5ghz,37244.html"},{"by":"david4096","descendants":85,"id":17263589,"kids":[17264269,17270158,17264073,17264423,17263922,17266397,17263975,17267912,17264460,17263963,17265858,17274701,17263996,17263907,17264268],"score":297,"time":1528446367,"title":"WebRTC Chat on IPFS","type":"story","url":"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmNURh26yenpqK5hK3ahRZhQJsaUttumepjtRWiVZXhnN1/p/webrtc-ipfs-chat.html"},{"by":"vincvinc","descendants":323,"id":17263565,"kids":[17266368,17265030,17265216,17266512,17265275,17268724,17265756,17266272,17265020,17265844,17265502,17265253,17267523,17265601,17264846,17265710,17264818,17268066,17269846,17265747,17272679,17264838,17264962,17265975,17265786,17265268],"score":288,"time":1528446147,"title":"Nearly 80% of Japan’s Airbnbs removed in response to new home-share law","type":"story","url":"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/nearly-80-percent-of-japans-airbnbs-were-just-removed"},{"by":"mdrzn","descendants":2,"id":17263447,"kids":[17263494,17263923],"score":5,"text":"Since many online newspapers are putting up a paywall, or straight up blocking visitors from EU, I think it&#x27;s time to consider adding or changing the &quot;web&quot; link that we see here in the comment page.\nI know that it&#x27;s used to search on Google for the same article with the intent to bypass the paywall, but time after time it failed me.<p>I&#x27;d personally love to see an &quot;Outline&quot; link which automatically redirects to the uncluttered version of an article using outline.com, which provides a great service.

CrashPlan is a data backup company that recently decided to shut down their consumer business. I have tons of data there, and I&#x27;ve been trying to download it before they close my account. I say trying because their client mostly sits idle while in recovery mode, not actually transferring files, which is why I have been working with their support team. However, what I received was appalling, and an outrageous breach of trust.<p>I found that some files of mine seemed to be missing from my backup archive, and the response I got on this topic was the following (copied verbatim):<p>&gt; What are some examples of subfolders you are not seeing? For instance, I am seeing that your zstorage contents are marked as &quot;deleted&quot;. This doesn&#x27;t mean they are removed, but that CrashPlan doesn&#x27;t see them present on the current device. ... I am seeing multiple sub-directories marked the same, and they should be visible if you select &quot;Include Deleted Files&quot; from the three-dot button in the upper right.<p>Seriously, CrashPlan? You can view the contents of my archive? According to the technical documentation, my archive is encrypted with my account password.

If you have any thoughts, I&#x27;d love to hear them.","time":1528384214,"title":"Can we talk about GitHub's recent censorship instead of flagging it here on HN?","type":"story"},{"by":"AndyKelley","descendants":236,"id":17256394,"kids":[17259039,17257758,17257642,17257028,17257098,17256892,17257332,17256991,17257008,17256607,17256911,17258709,17256691,17256803,17256767,17256805,17257824,17256721,17257458,17256881,17256821,17256773,17263794,17262475,17257803,17258523,17261326,17272018,17257095,17259194,17262682,17259634,17257820,17259814,17256839,17257137,17257708],"score":399,"time":1528384048,"title":"I Quit My Job to Live on Donations to Zig","type":"story","url":"https://andrewkelley.me/post/full-time-zig.html"},{"by":"deegles","descendants":211,"id":17256341,"kids":[17257588,17257366,17256638,17257391,17257863,17259301,17256687,17258304,17256760,17257731,17262877,17256761,17263113,17256884,17256610,17256971],"score":160,"time":1528383694,"title":"Half of all adults in the world have less than $2,300 in wealth (2016)","type":"story","url":"https://qz.com/848181/half-of-all-adults-in-the-world-have-less-than-2300-in-wealth-credit-suisse-global-wealth-report-indicates/"},{"by":"jdowner","descendants":2,"id":17256322,"kids":[17260189,17258616],"score":23,"text":"The algorithm design manual is really nice in that it provides a mapping from problems to algorithmic approaches.

The list is for a niche website notifying them of new articles (free).<p>We used mailchimp&#x27;s suggested process[1] of sending an email with an opt-in link taking them to a form with a consent checkbox. Subscribers failing to opt-in actually remain on the list for billing purposes, but without a GDPR flag set.<p>My task, to save costs was to remove around 8k subscribers...<p>I created a segment to filter using their newly created GDPR fields, but whenever that segment is used it takes several minutes to load. Cycling through the pager takes a similar time too.<p>There is no way to easily delete all users in this segment, There is only a select visible checkbox, not a select all checkbox, at most you can only select 100 email addresses at once. It does retain the selection if you go to the next page, but it does take a long time to do so.<p>Once you trigger the delete action, it adds it as a background task, this makes sense but it affects the pager in an unpredictable way, the safest way is just to wait, go back to the list screen and reapply the segment. It&#x27;s easy to get stuck on a page that says there is no results when there are.<p>I&#x27;ve found the only way to do it with my list is to break the segment down so the result is less than a thousand (I started with accounts not changed in x years, then get more recent), then I go through those pages deleting those users.<p>It&#x27;s taken me a couple of hours to delete about 3,000 so far.<p>Funnily enough, when using segments that don&#x27;t relate to GDPR the UI is much snappier. Is this poor database optimisation for a rushed feature, or a dark UI pattern to dissuade people from using this?<p>Why no Select All button?, I vaguely remember them having one in the past, when I was doing research on how to handle selection of large numbers of records, but I cannot be sure about that.<p>[1] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;eepurl.com&#x2F;dqP8Bb","time":1528306554,"title":"Mailchimp:

Rather it&#x27;s now become a platform for marketers to promote stuff...<p>www.readory.com will be completely overhauled into one of two things based on what the HN community and our Users think.<p>Here are the two options for Readory:<p>Option 1 - Readory becomes a centralised publishing platform for writers who wish to earn $$$. Currently, there are no platforms similar to youtube for creators where a writer can earn proper $$$ moolah for their content. As a bootstrapped business the idea would be to go head to hips with Medium allowing bloggers to publish their content and earn some money from it. Basically, I would connect advertisements to a Users article (if they wish to monetise) and dish out 95% of the total that article makes. (Adsense Host perhaps)<p>Option 2 - The original model of sharing articles stand-put but rather than one link being shared many links would be collated into an &quot;edition&#x2F;collection&quot; in order to have more original and shareable content. The idea is that a User can collate some articles from around the web, leave a commentary and turn it into a sort of shareable magazine. An example would be &quot;Interviews with Developers turned Founders&quot; a small commentary I&#x27;ve left and perhaps 5 of my favourite articles related to that subject.

People love Electron because it makes it easy to develop cross-platform apps, and hate it because it does this by giving each app a full browser instance to do it. Personally, I&#x27;d be glad for experts in Electron to speak on how to build quality Electron apps (for example: VS Code) because if people are going to build using Electron as a user I&#x27;d like to see it done well.<p>The talks at ElectronConf2017, the first conference entirely devoted to Electron, used a blind review process for talks which due to the gender representation skew in tech led to an all male line up of speakers.\nThis drew the ire of people on twitter. After many scathing tweets which got the attention of then VP of Social Impact Nicole Sanchez the conference was not only postponed, but publicly postponed before the presenters were told.<p>Fast forward to today: ElectronConf2017 was effectively cancelled due to outrage because certain people were unhappy with the lineup of speakers.<p>Why is this important?<p>Firstly, because speakers were robbed of the chance to present because people didn&#x27;t like their gender. But from a broader perspective, like it or not Electron is here to stay. We have no way of knowing what improvements could have been made to the Electron framework as an outcome of that conference. There may have been an opportunity for the community to talk about improvements to auto-updating Electron apps, sandboxing the browser backend to reduce the disk and memory footprint, and who knows what other improvements to be made.<p>Because of the outrage of angry individuals, people were denied the opportunity the speak, and technology that is a huge part of the developer landscape has been impacted.<p>Will there be an ElectronConf 2018?

HN,<p>I&#x27;m having a personal crisis,trying to figure out if software engineering is for me or if I&#x27;ve been sticking with it due to golden handcuffs.<p>I come from a non-traditional engineering background (though related to computer science). It was a program I sort of fell into and enjoyed enough to stick with for four years.<p>I&#x27;ve been out of school, in industry, for almost 5 years. I&#x27;ve had the luxury of working for a medium-sized org, as well as a startup, and have shipped a handful of products.<p>The problem is, I&#x27;m not engaged while at work. I find myself zoning off, 1000-yard-stare-style. I am tired or disinterested in the work going on around me -- both in the larger org, as well as on my team and even my own work.<p>This was the reason I left the larger org for a startup, hoping to find a place where I felt more engaged. Yet, the feelings persist. I&#x27;m apathetic about the problems of my company as well as the technical problems we have to resolve. Some of my coworkers seem to revel in it, and obsess over the latest industry happenings and what not. Meanwhile, I&#x27;m glancing at the clock, waiting for 6PM so I can go home.<p>I should note here that I always hit my deadlines, so I&#x27;m not dead weight on the team. I just don&#x27;t.. care that much about it.<p>Now, I&#x27;m trying to determine if this is a case of a poor company fit, a case of &quot;golden handcuffs&quot;, or something else. Salary is a big motivator for me and I&#x27;ve been fortunate in that department. Yet I also don&#x27;t have the drive to tackle side projects and my own things outside of work. I&#x27;ll learn what&#x27;s required to get the job done. But at the end of the day I&#x27;m not learning for fun or working on a side-hustle. I leave work at work.<p>Could this be indicative of software engineering not being right for me? It&#x27;s the only field I&#x27;ve ever considered pursuing, and I don&#x27;t have anything else pulling me.","time":1528069201,"title":"Ask HN: How do you know if you're just not cut out for software engineering?","type":"story"},{"by":"AgentK20","descendants":455,"id":17223116,"kids":[17223357,17223397,17223338,17223512,17223909,17224070,17223593,17224553,17226959,17223589,17225590,17223445,17224077,17223703,17223342,17224099,17223437,17223794,17223950,17223701,17224035,17224321,17225381,17223586,17224105,17224336,17223690,17223851,17225057,17227008,17223597,17225989,17228129,17224391,17226100,17226747,17227832,17230205,17223829,17224748,17226338,17225056,17236856,17224801,17224082,17227971,17223795,17231190,17225875,17224694,17225433,17224141,17223482,17227855,17227951,17223953,17224212,17223835,17225161,17227078,17226980,17226981,17223394,17226407,17227116,17227100,17225392,17226935,17224217,17223433,17223643,17223212,17224357,17226277,17224171],"score":1736,"time":1528068598,"title":"GitLab sees huge spike in project imports","type":"story","url":"https://monitor.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/github-importer?orgId=1"},{"by":"faisals","descendants":0,"id":17223108,"kids":[17304247,17304515],"score":6,"text":"I&#x27;m looking for a standard file format to describe my private network.

I started as I love to make things. I mostly make web apps &amp; APIs.<p>I have since hit a wall, I am struggling to make things. Not because I am out of ideas, but because I am paralysed by languages and frameworks. I am struggling with filtering and the Fear of Commitment.<p>I know many think frameworks are a curse, but after years of hand rolling, I want one. It’s a blocker for me wanting to make new things that almost always need auth, emails, and billing.<p>Question: What language(&amp;web framework) would you recommend I invest in, as someone that enjoys making over the art of programming?<p>Now I use Node. It has allowed me to build cool things, at a great cost. Having to hand roll a lot of things is insecure and very time consuming when you’re trying to make things quickly.<p>I have since been looking for alternatives<p>Go: A wonderful language, maybe my favourite, but ultimately falls short where Node does - no mature frameworks, with added verbosity.<p>Ruby&amp;RoR: It appears to be on the decline, although it’s hard to see through all the click bait articles. I wish I had learned Ruby &amp; RoR years ago, I was burned by the complaints that it was not fast enough, but nothing I have made has needed to care about the speed! ;)<p>Elixir&amp;Pheonix: Looks promising, same hype that RoR had when it was growing. Though this is where the Fear of Commitment enters. I know so little about Erlang and the origins of Elixir that this would be a great leap of faith.<p>PHP&amp;Laravel: My first programming language. Laravel looks like it has come a long way and is extremely feature rich, but the PHP language never sat well with me.<p>Python&amp;Django: I have never touched a line of Python, I have heard great things them, but this would be a completely fresh start for me, the same issue that Elixir presents, but with a much more mature language and framework.<p>Thanks.","time":1527862040,"title":"Ask HN: Web framework choice paralysis and commitment","type":"story"},{"by":"robertwiblin","descendants":349,"id":17205357,"kids":[17205622,17207632,17205812,17205842,17205691,17205763,17205780,17205857,17209846,17205722,17205703,17210854,17207720,17208552,17205704,17206358,17206369,17222536,17206592,17213292,17205673,17206298,17206365,17210734,17212270,17212442,17207031,17211186,17207106,17212384,17206140,17207287,17211840,17210454,17217696,17206518,17207095,17205567,17206397,17212241,17212240,17211807,17208343,17213156,17209545,17206886,17212508,17206000,17205651,17205851,17206017,17206324,17206066,17205809],"score":357,"time":1527861562,"title":"Politics is bad because we use an 18th century voting system","type":"story","url":"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/aaron-hamlin-voting-refor/"},{"by":"cvaidya1986","descendants":5,"id":17205368,"kids":[17205380,17205445],"score":4,"text":"Too often we listen to everyone except our own heart.

Here, when I say &quot;community,&quot; I really mean &quot;online community.&quot;<p>To me, the most puzzling thing about programming is that there is no real place to actually <i>discuss</i> programming.<p>As weird&#x2F;absurd as that sounds, it seems like three major avenues where most discussion occurs are:<p>1. Reddit. Subreddits are nice and very effectively organize discussion of different topics. On the other hand, Reddit is virtually anonymous, and it&#x27;s generally frowned upon to share anything of your own creation, in order to not be flagged as spam&#x2F;self-promotion.<p>2. Hacker News. It&#x27;s more than acceptable to submit your own content, or other people&#x27;s content you found interesting. The downside is that it&#x27;s very difficult to get to the frontpage, and most posts not on the frontpage are forgotten. There&#x27;s also the fact that this site is far more anonymous than Reddit, and that features like downvoting are blocked off for most users.<p>3. Twitter. I like Twitter because it&#x27;s very personal, and you can actually put faces to names (unheard of elsewhere). The downside here is that for anyone to hear anything you&#x27;re saying, you truly have to have tens of thousands of followers. I have 4,000, but most of those people are not programmers, and thus there&#x27;s less than a smidgeon of opportunity for any sort of programming discussion there.<p>So, I&#x27;ve always wondered.<p>Is the reason that there is no real online community, the fact that maybe we just don&#x27;t need one?<p>Thoughts?

At that point I was already a programmer and would only do the homework&#x2F;tests. 4.0, easy class.<p>Outside of that its been google + stackoverflow + tutorials.<p>Thats been great and I&#x27;ve completed a full stack app, working on my second using react-native. Doing python automation when I get tired of that.<p>What I&#x27;m looking for is something that I&#x27;m missing. I spent time reading wikipedia about OOP and I found that very interesting to put names to things Ive been working with for years. I dont know if this improved my skill much, but I only put a few hours into wiki.<p>What should I put resources into next? Goal is to spend either a few hours or ~week into something that can improve my abilities. I&#x27;m not even sure what my weak points are. Any suggestions?","time":1527775305,"title":"Ask HN: 10 years of recreational programming, what takes me to the next

HN!<p>I&#x27;m at a crossroads in my life with two very different paths and I&#x27;m not sure of which to pick. For context, I&#x27;m 25&#x2F;F with a MSME currently in the midwest. I&#x27;m in a unique situation and am looking for advice.<p>My current options:<p>1. Paid PhD ($90k salary + tuition) at a midwest state university. In exchange, I sign a service commitment with the Department of Energy for ~15 years after the PhD is completed.<p>2. Move to SV and work at an autonomous car company (think Lyft&#x2F;Uber ATC). $150k salary + ~$100k in RSUs&#x2F;year<p>The government route is obviously very stable and has a pension, decent benefits, etc. However, the work will trend from technical to managerial (contract management, etc) within less than 3 years of graduating with the PhD. Exciting work is traded for stability + pension.<p>The startup route is almost the polar opposite - not stable but with almost a guarantee of interesting work! Additionally, friends and family (from the midwest) are always talking about the tech bubble in SV and how autonomous car companies could be killed tomorrow by regulation.<p>If the RSUs are valued at $0, then the SV offer is a slight pay cut.<p>Many of my academic friends would kill for a $90k&#x2F;year fellowship + stable job after graduation; many of my industry friends would love a $250k compensation package.<p>Has anyone been in a similar situation?

My response back then was to spend hours yak shaving and going down rabbit holes. As a student, this led to a lot of wasted time. When I got to the workplace, this habit led to me getting some pretty strongly-worded feedback that I needed to get better at asking for help when I ran into these sorts of problems. After a few years, I’ve mostly gotten over the “I’m not a real engineer if I only have a surface-level understanding of npm” feeling. Asking well-framed questions leads to a coworker popping up and unblocking me pretty quickly and the team as a whole moving more efficiently.<p>But what do I do for personal projects?<p>Is there anyone who has a really solid understanding of npm, gems, rvm, protractor, node-debugger, etc. and offers the service where I can book time on their calendar a week from now, send them a clear description of my problem, and videochat with them for 5 minutes to 45 minutes and then pay for 45 minutes of their time? What would rates generally be?<p>Folks with experience doing consulting or services, how would you structure such a transaction? Would it be best to have someone on retainer?

Here&#x27;s a quick summary with two screenshots showing what it looks like: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;abi&#x2F;status&#x2F;1001432164569960451\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;abi&#x2F;status&#x2F;1001432164569960451</a><p>For some background, Pull Reminders is used by over a thousand developers and has 100+ new developers signing up each week. I&#x27;ve been looking at strategies to reach more potential customers without having to spend money or a ton of time so a referral program seemed like it had potential.<p>There are well-known success stories out there of referral programs designed by consumer products like DropBox, but far fewer for B2B, and almost none that I found which were targeted at developers (DigitalOcean is one).<p>I considered a cash incentive (ie. $25 per converted referral), but developers are well-paid so offering cash seemed like it could actually be a turn off. I considered offering credits, but Pull Reminders is expensed by teams so for an individual on the team this feels like a poor incentive. This eventually led me to the idea of offering free coffee (and tea)–not just regular coffee, but high-end coffee from specialty roasters. It&#x27;s a generalization but I feel that most developers like coffee, and getting a bag of specialty coffee seems like it could be a fun and novel reward.<p>I have no idea if my approach or design is good so I would love your thoughts and feedback.

run a mid-sized online community that has about 2 million pageviews a month, through a limited company in the EU.<p>At the moment it is entirely financed through advertisements. This brings in just about enough money to justify running it, but I don&#x27;t really like this model. Not only are the ads annoying (I even use an Adblocker myself) but I suspect that they are also not very good value for me. In addition, there are of course all the complications introduced by GDPR, which mean I am not even sure anymore if I should continue to use services like AdSense at all.<p>Over the last few months and years I have been thinking more and more about introducing some sort of subscription feature, where members could pay a small monthly fee to become an official &quot;supporter&quot; of the site. This would then hide all ads, give them a little badge on their profile and maybe access to some bonus features in the future.<p>However, I have been shying away from doing this so far, mostly because the tax implications sound very complicated. If I understand the rules correctly, I would have to charge each user VAT based on their home country and then report the VAT I have collected to each home country every month. And to do this, I might even have to register with the tax authorities in every country?! However, it seems like Stripe may have something to help with this [0] although that may be more US-focused.<p>Has anybody here tried doing something like this? How complicated is this in practice? Or can anybody recommend a service that takes care of these issues for you?

past couple years have been dominated by the hype cycle of cryptocurrencies as an incentive mechanism for decentralization. Hundreds of “N sided marketplace” problems have been reframed to fit within decentralized solutions. And yet, none of them have really succeeded. There is no “killer app” representing the decentralized marketplace du-jour.<p>I can’t help but wonder if many of these projects are approaching the solution the wrong way. The fundamental problem underpinning decentralization is one of governance and direction. Too many cooks in the kitchen means solutions can become diluted with unnecessarily indirect incentive mechanisms.<p>Decentralization is a spectrum. There is a middle ground between a decentralized solution and a centralized solution. That middle ground is federation.<p>To me, federation has always seemed a better solution for decentralized marketplaces than full decentralization, because it decouples economic incentives from those of technology suppliers. As long as we live in a world where fiat currency and nation states dominate transactional and regulatory environments, it is unavoidable that any large enterprise pursuing legitimacy will need to interact within the bounds of laws and regulations. Given that, it seems that federation offers a better solution than decentralization because it allows service operators to define their own economic processes according to their own jurisdictions and regulations, whereas decentralization is more of a free-for-all that can meet only the lowest common denominator of regulatory and economic restrictions.<p>What does HN think? Is decentralization overhyped? Would many projects be better suited to a hybrid model of decentralized infrastructure and federated transactions?","time":1527509381,"title":"Ask HN: When is federation a better solution than

As of right now, I’m on a CouchDB (Cloudant) NoSQL database in the cloud while using PouchDB on Asyncstorage using a library in React Native. It&#x27;s a bit buggy for me right now.<p>I was wondering if anyone has done something like my below use case and could give me some guidance on what I should choose. My biggest issue is wrapping my head around how to do these multi-master type syncing requirements I have. Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated.<p>My use case is as follows:<p>Master Database — This is in the cloud. And is the complete repository where all documents are stored.<p>Local intranet(s) — We install a local database on a linux machine on worksites. They periodically have access to the internet, which is how they will grab and send data from the mater database; but for the most part, they will be offline but will be connected to a local wifi network that devices can access. It should be noted that I only grab specific documents from the cloud. Time based and maybe like 50 other documents that are based on type. And then obviously any documents that are added to the database, we push to the master manually when we have internet.<p>Device(s) — During an online set up with the master database or via the local intranet, there are about 50 documents that are necessary to run this application that we need to grab. This is where all the documents are created. Depending on worksite, we want to make live queries to the master database or live queries with the local intranet. Whenever a document is created, we want to push this to either one of those so all devices can share the same information. Whether it be device-&gt;local intranet-&gt;cloud or device-&gt;cloud, the documents that are created need to get off the device and to the master. Once they are on the local intranet, we are goodie, or once they are on the cloud.<p>I should note that we never update a document atm to avoid conflicts and to keep an audit trial.","time":1527461121,"title":"Ask HN: Need help choosing a database for a local-remote multi master sync","type":"story"},{"by":"oggyhead","descendants":41,"id":17169359,"kids":[17176551,17170413,17171746,17179097,17175178,17170732,17177278,17171999,17176215,17183955,17180664,17185581,17184084,17174189,17177203,17169917,17184865,17171547,17170265,17184651,17183346,17171267,17172352,17185305,17174404,17184601,17175564,17186954,17183627,17176217,17180905,17178418,17183559,17170160],"score":32,"text":"Mine for some reason is &quot;By relieving the brain of all unecessary work, a good notation sets it free to concentrate on more advanced problems, and in effect increases the mental power of the race&quot;","time":1527458848,"title":"Ask HN: What is the one quote that you carry around in your head all the time?","type":"story"},{"by":"federicoponzi","descendants":242,"id":17169331,"kids":[17169700,17170432,17169710,17170030,17170548,17169778,17169612,17169614,17170560,17169672,17170749,17170106,17169488,17169918,17171120,17170987,17169688,17170994,17169544,17172268,17172438,17170556,17169606,17172881,17171636,17169607,17172751,17170171,17171658,17170771,17169618,17170159,17169520,17171927,17170905,17169812,17171126,17170353,17170699],"score":469,"time":1527458512,"title":"Python’s For - Else","type":"story","url":"http://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/for_-_else.html"},{"by":"rmason","descendants":311,"id":17169314,"kids":[17169646,17169504,17170640,17169469,17169639,17169514,17169543,17169477,17171066,17169597,17170453,17169562,17170838,17170715,17169486,17169588,17169420,17171621,17171193,17169972,17169638,17170661,17169586,17170784],"score":131,"time":1527458252,"title":"Macron Vowed to Make France a ‘Startup Nation.’ Is It Getting There?","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/business/emmanuel-macron-france-technology.html"},{"by":"amcrouch","descendants":2,"id":17169294,"kids":[17169662,17170180],"score":9,"time":1527457926,"title":"Google's Toronto city built 'from the internet up'","type":"story","url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-41414872"},{"by":"prostoalex","descendants":24,"id":17169291,"kids":[17173648,17177201,17177122,17177228,17176600,17176966,17175378,17170996,17173359,17173345],"score":82,"time":1527457885,"title":"An amateur investigator's hunt for the Zodiac killer","type":"story","url":"https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-serial-killer-as-a-marketing-genius/"},{"by":"rbanffy","descendants":15,"id":17169262,"kids":[17170146,17170128,17170177,17170818,17170823,17171987,17170649],"score":89,"time":1527457493,"title":"A Slower Speed of Light (2012)","type":"story","url":"http://gamelab.mit.edu/games/a-slower-speed-of-light/"},{"by":"mariuz","descendants":116,"id":17169209,"kids":[17170643,17171255,17170385,17171017,17170225,17170716,17170535,17171816,17170380,17174359,17170876,17169581,17171619,17170822,17173256,17170464,17172883,17171919,17170918,17172010,17171673,17171163,17173259,17170833,17170742,17170466],"score":159,"time":1527456699,"title":"How Voxels Became ‘The Next Big Thing’","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@EightyLevel/how-voxels-became-the-next-big-thing-4eb9665cd13a"},{"by":"mcenedella","descendants":4,"id":17169152,"kids":[17170205,17170629],"score":25,"time":1527455891,"title":"I found some COBOL.

Part of my duties include giving technical interviews to potential candidates. Lately, I have realized that I am much more lenient on women and minorities than I am with white men. I often give them more hints and offer deeper guidance when solving whiteboard problems than I do for white male candidates, and I tend to rate them higher than I would for their experience level, compared to how I would rate them if they were white &amp; male.<p>Another thing that I&#x27;ve realized, is that we are only giving offers for entry level positions to people of color and women. We really don&#x27;t need entry level people right now; we desperately need experienced&#x2F;seasoned engineers. Because of that we pass on entry-level&#x2F;junior applicants that are white males. However, because we value diversity highly, we often hire entry-level&#x2F;junior candidates who are minorities despite not really needing junior people at the moment.<p>I normally wouldn&#x27;t reach out to strangers on the internet with something like this, but I&#x27;m really conflicted about this, yet am afraid to say anything about it to others in the company.<p>Now that I&#x27;m aware of this, I have been trying to change how I approach these interviews. However, when I&#x27;m honest with myself I don&#x27;t think white males deserve the position as much as minorities and women. They&#x27;ve been reaping the benefits of their privilege for years, and now it only seems fair to reverse it. I still recommend hire for strong white male candidates, but not as readily as for a minority candidate.<p>I believe that most of us in the hiring pipeline do the same as I do.

getting into web development I&#x27;ve found myself regularly in contact with folks who take it for granted that OOP as a paradigm has proven itself a failure (typically with the attendant viewpoint that functional programming has proven itself to be superior).<p>My current perception is that it&#x27;s primarily bandwagon mentality promoting the above viewpoint. For instance, I was reading an article purporting to explain what object-oriented programming &#x27;really&#x27; is, and they cited as part of their motivation for bringing this up the wildly popular &quot;Goodbye, Object Oriented Programming&quot;[0]; and while the first article was not what I would call a particularly deep discussion of the nature of OOP, the popular article it referenced (with 44k upvotes) was just laughably unsophisticated, uninformed, and rhetoric-laden. Every point he put forward had such a simplistic rebuttal that I had to wonder if he was intentionally setting up straw-men or just didn&#x27;t know better.<p>So now it&#x27;s on my mind: &quot;is this the sort of thing folks are reading which has given them the idea that OOP has been disproven as effective?&quot;<p>Now I feel motivated to take a close look at the issue if there is a serious, well-informed dissection of the efficacy of OOP for modern developers. It would especially be valuable if instead of vaguely referring to inadequacies it also pointed out how alternate paradigms more successfully deal with specific points.<p>My current suspicion is, regarding OOP vs. functional: both can be used well or poorly, so a lot of it just comes down to the developer&#x27;s ability to exploit their features—and the rest just depends on the domain you&#x27;re trying to model. For instance, if that domain deals with a bunch of things that look and interact like objects, then OOP will probably be better; if it&#x27;s mostly a complex, abstract computation, functional would be better.<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@cscalfani&#x2F;goodbye-object-oriented-programming-a59cda4c0e53","time":1527208891,"title":"Ask HN: Is there a clear, mature discussion of OOP/functional tradeoffs?","type":"story"},{"by":"saalweachter","descendants":2,"id":17149977,"kids":[17150332,17149985],"score":3,"time":1527212254,"title":"'Whistleblower' taped to chair and gagged","type":"story","url":"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-44222575"},{"by":"andrenth","descendants":2,"id":17149658,"kids":[17149957,17149884],"score":12,"time":1527207607,"title":"Why Can’t a Woman Be More Like a Man?","type":"story","url":"http://quillette.com/2018/05/24/cant-woman-like-man/"},{"by":"prismatic","descendants":5,"id":17149479,"kids":[17156364,17156385],"score":16,"time":1527205442,"title":"Restless Violet Shadows: The official color of the impressionists","type":"story","url":"https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/restless-violet-shadows"},{"by":"Thevet","descendants":69,"id":17149467,"kids":[17154540,17154613,17155182,17149483,17154931,17159357,17156026,17154614],"score":59,"time":1527205267,"title":"The New Passport-Poor","type":"story","url":"http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2018/05/21/the-new-passport-poor/"},{"by":"Doubleguitars","descendants":38,"id":17149470,"kids":[17149583,17150501,17149820,17150274,17150928,17151534,17150047],"score":90,"time":1527205312,"title":"Apple Rejects Valve's Steam Link App Due to 'Business Conflicts'","type":"story","url":"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/05/24/apple-rejects-valve-steam-link-app/"},{"by":"mattkol","descendants":70,"id":17149604,"kids":[17149715,17149998,17150014,17150769,17151915,17154144,17154099,17154770,17150936,17154371],"score":143,"time":1527207008,"title":"Show HN: Chromely – Lightweight Alternative to Electron for .NET and .NET Core","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/mattkol/Chromely"},{"by":"Ralfp","descendants":5,"id":17149365,"kids":[17150079,17149761,17149517,17149439],"score":20,"time":1527203968,"title":"John Bain, YouTube most subscribed PC gaming critic has passed on","type":"story","url":"https://twitter.com/GennaBain/status/999785407087808512"},{"by":"liaai0630","descendants":7,"id":17149371,"kids":[17207377,17149405,17149422,17149430],"score":208,"time":1527204055,"title":"Show HN: Clippi.io lets you collect your visual inspiration from any video","type":"story","url":"https://clippi.io/"},{"by":"evo_9","descendants":6,"id":17149375,"kids":[17162859,17149623,17149473],"score":7,"time":1527204094,"title":"Elon Musk’s attempt to discredit the media is dangerous, even if he’s joking","type":"story","url":"https://slate.com/technology/2018/05/elon-musks-attempt-to-discredit-the-media-is-dangerous-even-if-hes-joking-about-the-whole-pravda-thing.html?via=recirc_recent"},{"by":"appdrag","descendants":6,"id":17149349,"kids":[17151200,17149524,17149384],"score":3,"text":"Just today alone i got something like 50 GDPR emails from companies telling me they have updated their policies.

Will the lawyer I speak to even look at a contract dispute that low?<p>Can I also be sued for threatening him with reaching out to his customer base and buyers.<p>I didn&#x27;t take the 3500, as I would like to see at least 9k.  But he isn&#x27;t willing to reach to that.<p>Help and any advise would be wonderful!","time":1527187012,"title":"Ask HN: Client won't pay me my invoice and disputed Paypal payment 3 months

At Dharma, we are creating a suite of protocols, standards, and developer tools for issuing and administering tokenized debt agreements on the Ethereum blockchain.<p>After three extensive external security audits of our smart contracts, we are releasing the public beta of Dharma Protocol v1 on the Ethereum mainnet -- developers can take a crack at building decentralized lending applications at docs.dharma.io, and non-developers can try out borrowing and lending a wide variety of crypto-assets using Dharma Plex (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plex.dharma.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plex.dharma.io</a>).<p>I first became interested in the cryptocurrency ecosystem in 2015, when I took Dan Boneh’s class on Bitcoin &amp; Cryptocurrencies at Stanford. Though the technology was (and still is) quite immature, I fell in love with the nascent space, and subsequently worked as an engineer at Coinbase.<p>At Coinbase, I was struck by the fact that a huge amount of users’ cryptocurrency was sitting idle in cold storage, instead of being deployed in some capacity as dollars would in a savings account.  The advent of generic, programmable blockchains like Ethereum presented an intriguing possibility -- what if we could build borderless infrastructure for borrowing and saving that wouldn’t require a company like Coinbase to sit in the middle?<p>That’s why I started working on Dharma -- a framework for originating, issuing, crowdfunding, and trading debt on blockchains like Ethereum.  In essence, what we do is create tools, standards, and smart contracts that developers can use to build profitable lending applications that can tap into a borderless pool of credit liquidity.  These tools are all fully open source and free to use -- there is no native “Dharma token” that users are forced to leverage in some capacity.<p>We look forward to hearing HN’s feedback &#x2F;

The constant need to start services, stop long executing queries (easily takes upwards of 20s for simple search). Higher ups have asked to look for Distributed solutions ( I am strongly against NOSQL while management is strongly against paid solution but they might give in after I tinker with some sort of trails &#x2F; open source versions). I am looking for guidance from you guys as are you using any distributed database in production (with the library available in php for connecting and stuff obviously).<p>I have tried installing cassandra (after which I am strongly against NOSQL) and citusDB which has some very serious limitations on the community edition (their open source offering) and also in general. Some more searching results in Postgres BDR, Cockroach DB, TimescaleDB (but this doesnt partition on NON-TIME columns).<p>My requirement is:<p>* to have a distributed database solution in place which is horizontally scalable.<p>* Easy to add nodes, remove nodes without any downtime (sure I can accomodate some write-locks for setup) \n* Have the ability to tweat replication factor. Ideally I would love to have replication = number of nodes i.e. each node has complete database. So that when there are simple queries, it doesnt have to do distributed queries (which make system slow) and when the query is a bit complex, it does distributed since data is available in each node.<p>* Best case: Some GIS based plugin &#x2F; extension on the solution would be icing on the cake.<p>* SQL compatible, so that least of the application rewrite is required.<p>Please help ..","time":1526901991,"title":"Ask HN: Which distributed database solutions would you suggest?","type":"story"},{"by":"MiriamWeiner","descendants":47,"id":17117504,"kids":[17120646,17119949,17120623,17120227,17120083,17121247,17120195,17120234,17120055,17120523,17119987],"score":39,"time":1526901306,"title":"Mexico’s take on the Cornish pasty","type":"story","url":"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20180520-a-piece-of-britain-lost-in-mexico"},{"by":"bookofjoe","descendants":45,"id":17117526,"kids":[17118010,17118149,17117789,17117980,17117947,17118221,17120574,17118638,17120327,17117767],"score":82,"time":1526901639,"title":"The Year on the Net (1996)","type":"story","url":"https://www.wsj.com/public/current/summaries/hypetoc.htm"},{"by":"Karmadilla","descendants":2,"id":17117477,"kids":[17117481,17121259],"score":2,"time":1526900776,"title":"Ask HN: Have you ever pulled a plug on sideproject before release, why?","type":"story"},{"by":"raleighm","descendants":40,"id":17117375,"kids":[17119239,17119929,17119075,17120251,17119076,17120421,17119698,17119049,17119037,17119137],"score":83,"time":1526899246,"title":"How a Company Scammed Silicon Valley and How It Got Caught","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/21/books/review/bad-blood-john-carreyrou.html"},{"by":"rbanffy","descendants":67,"id":17117342,"kids":[17118561,17117971,17117870,17117591,17120833,17121007,17118004,17117647,17117835,17117605,17117784],"score":123,"time":1526898599,"title":"Scientists think the cell nucleolus may play an important role in aging","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/20/science/nucleolus-cells-aging.html"},{"by":"aosaigh","descendants":82,"id":17117243,"kids":[17118657,17118900,17117796,17118868,17118174,17117817,17118177,17117614,17118036,17117253,17117948,17119034,17118989,17120403,17119862,17121874,17118032,17118998,17119857,17117661,17117513,17119430,17119633,17117620,17120197,17123845,17118259,17123568,17117830,17125337,17117675,17118328,17117834,17119045,17126475,17119377,17120852,17117579,17117708],"score":158,"text":"I&#x27;ve been developing web apps for 5+ years and in my next project I&#x27;ve been tasked with building a mobile (iOS and Android) app that we can also run as a web app. I would obviously like to try keep a single code base for simplicity as we have limited resources.

been thinking about how culture and religion conditions us since childhood. Parents play a huge role in this. I being  a young parent too want to pass on my religion to my kids - hence I read them stories , history etc - in an attempt that they can follow the same culture and religion as I do. But at the same time I do recognize that this is all conditioning and takes us away from the real essence of life - because we get so entrapped in dogma. I argue with myself that this conditioning is necessary and is similar to teaching a kid - abc alphabets. Eventually when they grow up they will understand the language and the use of learning alphabets. But cultural and religious conditioning becomes dogma and is harder to break from. Yuval Harari in his books Homo Sapiens touched a bit on this part. I am looking for more books&#x2F;talks&#x2F;articles on the same topic that can provide some more food for thought.

think pretty much everyone here is aware of the nasty things Upwork does. High fees, totalitarian policies, sudden suspensions and just marvellous support.<p>Essentially, it&#x27;s highly regulated labor exchange, with centralised authority. They CAN instantly ruin your career, or at least incapacitate it for a long time by just banning you and forbid to create another account. May be they will explain this, may they&#x27;ll just ignore you. Of course, this is not necessary because they are &quot;evil&quot;, but because they are just an instance of totalitarian hypocrisy in the internet. They create bunch of regulations, that make it very easy for scummer-type clients to blackmail you and ruin your profile. Why is it okay for so many people?<p>Can freelance be unregulated? With clients and freelancers dealing with each other without oversight?I was on both sides: as a freelancer and as a client on upwork. I was kicked off by upwork years ago, when i was just a beginner JS developer, i was dependant on them and it was really hard to keep going on. Since then I worked with many clients and even started my own development shop, which, i think, characterises me as capable and responsible person. Upwork&#x27;s regulations never helped me. I&#x27;ve proven to support that client explicitly blackmailing me with negative review - they unsuspended my account but didn&#x27;t delete the review, because it&#x27;s against their regulations. Well, you know what is happening with profile, once it got 1 star review from the beginning. Since then i dealt with clients without any regulations. It was reasonably easy to spot scammers and avoid dealing with them: you can just do small part of the job, get paid and grow amounts of client-to-freelancer debt gradually along with trust. That was years ago, but still, when i hear again and again what is going on there, i feel sorry for all of the good freelancers who have been damaged by Upwork.<p>What do you think? Can freelance exist on scale without regulations?","time":1526397020,"title":"Ask HN: Can Freelance be

We&#x27;re enabling local entrepreneurs to start their own Internet Service Providers by providing network engineering, monitoring, and business support as a service. We&#x27;ve seen huge improvements in last mile distribution technology in the last few years (cost, reliability, thoroughput, ease of deployment), but it hasn&#x27;t translated into an explosion of ISP operators. We want to change that by allowing non-network-engineers to deploy their own networks and compete with the incumbents. Necto handles the networking setup, deals with the backbone providers, helps with distribution planning, and provides ongoing monitoring and support. The operators pick the markets, set the prices, and provide a great overall experience to their customers.<p>We started our own ISP here in the underserved San Francisco markets of Bayview and Portola, with more neighborhoods to come. If you live in SF, we&#x27;d love to be your ISP (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joinnecto.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joinnecto.com</a>). If you&#x27;re interested in starting an ISP, we&#x27;re looking for an initial batch of 5 operators. You can learn more about that here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nectolab.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nectolab.io</a> .<p>Our product is a combination of a few important requirements for running an ISP effectively: a centralized Network Operations Center (NOC), a Operational Support System (OSS) to manage the subscribers and get visibility into issues, and an Operator&#x27;s Handbook that covers the how-to&#x27;s of running an ISP (both technically and our advice on the business side). Our NOC will handle things like BGP, routing, reachability, hardware issues, upstream connectivity, and distribution provisioning. The OSS supports managing subscribers, diagnosing common issues, and performing installations. Our handbook provides a list Standard Operating Procedures for day-to-day management of the ISP and, in combination with our community of ISP operators, strategies on how to effectively launch and grow an ISP.<p>We charge an initial setup fee and an ongoing percentage of revenue. The initial setup fee covers us designing your initial network, sourcing your backbone connection, and the cost of the core routing stack. The ongoing percentage of revenue aligns our incentives with our operators and covers monitoring, the NOC, and ongoing enhancements for the software and community. The exact numbers depend on the scale of the network the operators are building.<p>We&#x27;re staunch supporters of Net Neutrality and increasing broadband penetration without sacrificing privacy. We don&#x27;t sell personal information or throttle traffic (and our operators won&#x27;t either). We believe that the future is in highly localized ISPs competing on service quality. We&#x27;re excited to tackle this problem because we&#x27;ve had to deal with poor internet service before, and we now know that you can make a great business out of providing better quality access. Our backgrounds are in enterprise automation technology and the home services industry (air conditioning, plumbing, electric). We&#x27;re happy to answer as many questions about any of this as we can!

It&#x27;s appealing, but I&#x27;m worried that this is just another shiny new path that&#x27;ll dull quickly, and I&#x27;d still have to decide what type of work to do.<p>I&#x27;ve been trying to talk to as many people as I can about this in order to narrow down my decision space, but it just seems to do the opposite, new options keep appearing.","time":1526230524,"title":"Ask HN: How does one choose a programming specialization?","type":"story"},{"by":"causehealth101","descendants":8,"id":17059768,"kids":[17059976,17059795,17059851,17059913,17059986],"score":1,"text":"If a remote job requires occasional visits to the home office (e.g. for 1 week every 2 months), does the employer or employee cover this travel&#x2F;lodging cost?

Here are some thoughts that might support this:<p>1. Since I got hit so fast I&#x27;m assuming being exposed to a high number of bacteria.<p>2. The pathogens where possibly passed by an ill harvester.<p>3. Strawberries being sweet, moist and un-chilled seem to be the perfect fertile ground for reproduction.<p>4. The incubation period of colds is usually a lot longer (2-5 days). Does a higher number of bacteria result in a shorter incubation period?<p>5. Washing the strawberries would have helped.

Now I want to build a web application on top of my project. Basic use case would be:<p><pre><code>    User inputs his search request in html form.\n    User gets response without reloading the page.\n</code></pre>\nSeems fairly simple, however a couple of questions arises when it comes to choosing a technology, or technology stack:<p>1. SQL vs JSON.<p>I store my data in a JSON files now which seems to work quite nice: I have an array with 700-800 objects of about 5-6 key-value pairs of unicode strings and urls:<p>My old laptop search through that data blazingly fast, but what about the web? What will happen, when multiple users will try to access the same file at the same time? The question is, how much slower is reading and searching in JSON file as opposed to SQL database?<p>2. Python in PHP way.<p>I use Python as a general-purpose language, I write backend in PHP. This time not only do I want to write parsing&#x2F;crawling part of this app in Python, but I want to create and serve web pages using Python.<p>However, it finds out that Python gets quite complex when it comes to developing a web app. You have to use a full-fledged web framework such as Django which seems as quite an overkill to me, especially in my case when I do not need to worry about storing user&#x27;s data, no sign up or sign in is required, no email checking.

For anyone wondering how I didn&#x27;t know this going in - I had a feeling it leaned heavily MS, but was caught off guard that Apple wasn&#x27;t even an option.  Plus there were other factors that made this interesting so it wasn&#x27;t at the top of my checklist. That part hasn&#x27;t changed - I want things to work out well, I like the people, the project, the company, etc.<p>A part of me actually likes what MS has been doing lately and hates what Apple has done.  For example, I tried to buy the MBP w&#x2F; Touch Bar when it came out and that only lasted a week until I returned it:  Hated the Touch Bar (I need a real esc), hated the keyboard (especially the arrow keys with a full-size left&#x2F;right), hated the monster trackpad that my palms rest on and hit all the time.

So I&#x27;m <i>open</i>, just scared out my mind and want to settle on something I can eventually feel as at-home with long-term.<p>I&#x27;m looking for any relevant advice, particularly related to 1) approach with management, 2) closest&#x2F;comparable feeling laptop models I should explore that might give me what I&#x27;m after (hp is easiest for them), or 3) general advice about my own personal problem of being so attached to one specific model.","time":1526020847,"title":"Ask HN: MBP user making new job win/pc switch","type":"story"},{"by":"mpweiher","descendants":295,"id":17045308,"kids":[17046385,17045429,17045682,17047151,17045672,17045473,17047240,17045471,17045409,17045666,17045520,17045516,17045396,17045433,17045604,17045599,17045569,17045757,17047618,17047169,17046417,17050950,17045393,17077179,17045449,17047606,17045373,17047725,17046214,17045363,17046420,17050129,17046326,17059774,17046919,17050016,17045858,17045699,17045859,17045603,17045397,17046739,17045558,17049941,17048197,17046305,17045766,17047668,17045730,17046893,17047318,17046711,17047369,17046536,17045597,17047462,17047687,17045456,17045624,17046062,17046250,17045592],"score":583,"time":1526019732,"title":"Study Shows a Productivity Boost of Working From Home","type":"story","url":"https://www.inc.com/scott-mautz/a-2-year-stanford-study-shows-astonishing-productivity-boost-of-working-from-home.html"},{"by":"aard","descendants":6,"id":17045147,"kids":[17046562,17063335,17045838,17047749,17050496,17046175],"score":41,"time":1526016499,"title":"First, Let’s Fire All the Managers","type":"story","url":"https://hbr.org/2011/12/first-lets-fire-all-the-managers"},{"by":"nopinsight","descendants":25,"id":17045197,"kids":[17046074,17045410,17047844,17045310,17045220],"score":57,"time":1526017420,"title":"The meaning of the Vision Fund","type":"story","url":"https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21741973-succeed-or-fail-masayoshi-son-changing-world-technology-investing-meaning"},{"by":"narimiran","descendants":6,"id":17045230,"kids":[17045238,17049480],"score":18,"time":1526018149,"title":"Python vs. NumPy vs. Nim","type":"story","url":"https://narimiran.github.io/2018/05/10/python-numpy-nim.html"},{"by":"cheeaun","descendants":4,"id":17044916,"kids":[17049212,17047730],"score":41,"time":1526011827,"title":"Medium cancels the membership programs of its subscription publisher partners","type":"story","url":"http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/05/medium-abruptly-cancels-the-membership-programs-of-its-21-remaining-publisher-partners/"},{"by":"ayanai","descendants":172,"id":17044971,"kids":[17045869,17046107,17047050,17046671,17047220,17047076,17046469,17047346,17046994,17046700,17045164,17046616,17047019,17053056,17048552,17047549,17047002,17048541,17049538,17049231,17062837,17049963,17050200,17048538,17054532,17050237,17047823,17049076,17049229,17050045,17047981,17060325,17046033],"score":259,"time":1526012954,"title":"FCC fines robocaller record $120M","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/10/fcc-slaps-robocaller-with-record-120m-fine-but-its-like-emptying-the-ocean-with-a-teaspoon/"},{"by":"NaOH","descendants":9,"id":17044777,"kids":[17045079,17044926,17045231,17047037],"score":74,"time":1526009292,"title":"Robert N.

Previous posts: [1][2].<p>I am considering getting into research, and I&#x27;m trying to figure out how one goes about finding a problem to solve.\nBackstory: I completed my bachelors in &#x27;16 with some significant side&#x2F;hobby projects (kernel&#x2F;systems) and I&#x27;m now working as an engineer at one of the Major Ones :&#x2F;. Although it pays well for now, I am slowly losing motivation and creativity and it is replacing my &#x27;engineering for the fun of it&#x27; mindset with &#x27;do what you&#x27;re told to&#x27;. I&#x27;ll need to adapt heavily to be able to thrive in this environment as a generic software engineer. I&#x27;m not learning, I&#x27;m not specializing, and I start to realize that I want to put in concentrated effort and work towards something for myself. Hence the idea of pursuing research. Or working for&#x2F;on a startup.<p>My reason for going into academia to pursue a PhD would be, to be able to focus X years of independent research towards an idea I think can turn into a product later. But that depends on the idea&#x2F;domain, the supervisors I work with and how success is measured (number of publications v&#x2F;s real-world outcome, which may have a gap).

I use Android so I can&#x27;t speak for iOS but it feels like it was built hastily by bunch of junior developers with complete lack of regard for quality.<p>Okey some UI mistakes here and there sure, not a big deal. However for an app like Tinder I&#x27;d assume that there was a throughout testing for errors due to internationalization. In my language at least there is one glaring error in the spelling or at least it reads very weirdly.<p>But what really bothers me and contributed me to submit this question is that I recently or well I think it has been ongoing for a while is a bug that stops me from changing my personal information. Like really, this is the level of quality I can expect?

I&#x27;ve been coding for years and one of the things I constantly see companies do is write and rewrite a document storage system, so I decided to write one for them. Bitbox.co uses cloud storage (currently Azure) to store documents but can be coded to use any cloud service. Documents can be public or private and URLs to that document can be used directly in HTML. There are currently a list of WebAPIs for developers to use as a tool, or build an entire system around.<p>This is an MVP and it&#x27;s simple. Upload a file, get a token; like a valet or coat check. When you want that file back, send the token and you get a byte stream. There is also a built in file converter, so you can can upload a docx file and retrieve it as a pdf by appending .pdf to the URL, for example: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bitbox.co&#x2F;files&#x2F;1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bitbox.co&#x2F;files&#x2F;1.pdf</a>, or perhaps a tiff: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bitbox.co&#x2F;files&#x2F;1.tif\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bitbox.co&#x2F;files&#x2F;1.tif</a>. Files can be marked as public or private, and account owners can invite other users to join their team with read, write or admin privileges.<p>There are some directions I want to possibly go:<p><pre><code>  - Allow users to select their own cloud store (Azure, AWS, etc) rather than the built in store.\n  - Allow users to replicate their files between cloud stores, so you would store your documents on all your cloud stores in Azure or AWS, etc.\n  - Folder structures for organization\n  - Integration with third party platforms like WordPress or SurgarCRM\n  - Cookbook for code examples on how to connect through the WebAPI in various languages.\n  - Local install so developers can use their internal SMB shares to store files.\n  - File level security, and &#x2F; or folder level security for users &#x2F; files.\n</code></pre>\nThis was designed for IT departments without a strong development team to save money.

I created a side-project which scratches an extremely niche itch that I have--having to fill out forms with data that I&#x27;ve already entered beforehand. This app extracts your name from your email address (in ~20% of the emails in my dataset, the first, last, or both names were included in the email) and puts them in the form for you. I&#x27;m hoping that this app can also increase conversions by offering a more personal experience to filling out forms, and reduces the number of fields the user has to enter.<p>For example, I signup for a service on a website. The website wants my first name, last name, and email address. Normally, I would have to fill in all of these boxes separately. However, I created an app which takes your email address (for example sarahjane@example.com), and converts it into a first and last name by using a modified sliding-window algorithm to maximize the match (I get around 90% accuracy on some test data with 100&#x27;s of pairs.)<p>You&#x27;d only have to fill in the first email box, and the other boxes (first name and last name)  automatically fill in with Sarah and Jane. It can also handle some complex cases (such as johnimble@example.com and converts it to John and Nimble, as &quot;joh&quot; is unlikely to be a name.)<p>It also properly capitalizes the first and last name based on previous data (e.g. MacDonald, McDonald, deJoan) and correctly places accent marks over your name if needed.<p>The problem: autofill. Autofill is very popular (included in all major browsers), but I can&#x27;t find any hard stats on how many people use it. Of course, this would reduce the usefulness of this app to around zero, since all of the information would already exist.<p>Would you pay for this if you were a website owner? Would you find this useful if someone were to implement this on their website? Perhaps it could customize the login flow after you&#x27;ve entered in your email address (so it&#x27;ll say &quot;Hi Sarah&quot; after automatically extracting your first name.)","time":1525732997,"title":"Ask HN: Validate whether my side-project could be profitable","type":"story"},{"by":"eganist","descendants":12,"id":17017043,"kids":[17017050,17017446,17017612,17017531,17021278],"score":14,"time":1525732630,"title":"Walmart.com","type":"story","url":"http://Walmart.com"},{"by":"SEJeff","dead":true,"id":17017037,"kids":[17017729,17017192,17017182],"score":25,"time":1525732595,"title":"Abortion joke added by RMS removed from glibc docs","type":"story","url":"https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blobdiff;f=manual/startup.texi;h=21c48cd0374dcc906c33165267412081fc7de2dc;hp=7395d32dd0c877487938857fd432650e87fe7bb2;hb=340d9652b9d0e1d4136588f18b726662d195777c;hpb=c57bf7c15ba179168d01f7c6acde7ecbf5dd9cd8"},{"by":"esalazar","descendants":2,"id":17017166,"kids":[17017593,17018412],"score":3,"time":1525733989,"title":"A Criminal Gang Used a Drone Swarm to Obstruct an FBI Hostage Raid","type":"story","url":"https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2018/05/criminal-gang-used-drone-swarm-obstruct-fbi-raid/147956/?oref=d-topstory"},{"by":"mavdi","descendants":2,"id":17017429,"kids":[17017703,17017464],"score":3,"time":1525736580,"title":"Atari's new console","type":"story","url":"https://atarivcs.com"},{"by":"MBCook","descendants":48,"id":17016791,"kids":[17016839,17018002,17016865],"score":27,"time":1525730045,"title":"GoDaddy has shut down Richard Spencer’s white supremacist site","type":"story","url":"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/05/godaddy-has-shut-down-richard-spencers-white-supremacist-site/"},{"by":"rssathe","descendants":6,"id":17016758,"kids":[17016951,17021053,17020126],"score":133,"time":1525729783,"title":"How to get your personal data from apps you use","type":"story","url":"https://try.mydatarequest.com/"},{"by":"consumer451","descendants":4,"id":17016686,"kids":[17016864,17016860,17016712],"score":3,"time":1525729174,"title":"In a fatal crash, Uber’s autonomous car detected a person, but chose to not stop","type":"story","url":"https://www.technologyreview.com/the-download/611094/in-a-fatal-crash-ubers-autonomous-car-detected-a-pedestrian-but-chose-to-not/"},{"by":"h3cate","descendants":12,"id":17016709,"kids":[17019073,17024144,17025822,17018011,17017905],"score":17,"text":"I have started a business for my university project (link: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;OrderHappy.uk).
