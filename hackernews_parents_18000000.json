Because there is no value (not even fiat acceptance) intrinsic to any coin, they are useless without a utility function.<p>Some blockchain models have tried to solve this (lack of utility) with smart contracts. Smart contracts are also broken, though, for distributed trust systems. Sure, they might work on chain, but when someone needs to author a real-estate deal there is some trusting that happens off-chain. And when trust (the entire point of the blockchain) occurs off-chain there is no guarantee that what you expect to happen has actually happened (did they sell the property, is it in the condition described, etc.).<p>So, the only utility (smart contracts) for distributed trust systems can&#x27;t be trusted when it comes to real applications.<p>The only other way any fiat currency gains utility is mass acceptance (which all crypto currencies lack). If I can&#x27;t buy a cup of coffee with it, why would I accept XYZ coin as payment for anything.<p>So, I argue for utility. If any currency&#x2F;blockchain technology is going to be successful it needs to be useful for <i>something</i>. In short: can I buy stuff I want with it?<p>My question is: how can the ideas of crypto currency and blockchain be leveraged in a way that is actually useful on a mass market scale? (ie, how do we bring utility to an idea that has been fluff - &#x27;mining&#x27;, really?! - so far?)","time":1542725813,"title":"Crypto currencies and blockchain are broken because they lack utility","type":"story"},{"by":"ikeboy","descendants":143,"id":18494137,"kids":[18494824,18495047,18496459,18495703,18497086,18495346,18495134,18494950,18495732,18494750,18494638,18494601,18495975,18497920,18495524],"score":128,"time":1542725404,"title":"Tumblr was removed from Apple’s App Store over child pornography issues","type":"story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/20/18104366/tumblr-ios-app-child-pornography-removed-from-app-store"},{"by":"PXD3D","descendants":5,"id":18494138,"kids":[18494224,18501549,18494527],"score":2,"text":"Bitcoin is down ~30% in the past week to lowest in ~1 year &amp; down 80% from its all-time high.

The replacement caused more problems than it solved, and I&#x27;ve been stuck twice in as many months.<p>First time, we were there for 2.5 hours. We rang the alarm after 5 mins when we realized it wasn&#x27;t moving. The call box didn&#x27;t give a response so we used cell phones. We called the building and they sent someone over. The man banged on the door for 20 mins but failed to open it. We didn&#x27;t call the fire dept because we were worried (correctly) that they&#x27;d break the elevator to get us out, leaving it offline for months. After 1 hour we insisted that they call the fire department. After this it took about 40 mins to get us out. We were fine since neither of us are claustrophobic, and understood that elevators have redundancies.<p>2nd time, we were in for 20 minutes. We called the building and told them to immediately call the fire department. They sent a worker over who opened the doors and (perhaps against protocol) told us to hurry out by climbing up the 3-foot ledge. They said they would take the elevator offline until a technician arrived, but I saw someone else get into that same elevator an hour and a half later.<p>With those situations in mind: \n- What might be wrong with the elevator? Snapped cables? Mis-calibration? \n- Does&#x2F;should the building have a responsibility to call 911? Should the elevator passengers?\n- Is a building fined by the fire dept when they need to let people out of the elevator? I got the feeling that my building was reluctant to call, and I&#x27;m curious about why.\n- The 2nd time, were let out by a building employee and not the fire department. He seemed to think he wasn&#x27;t allowed to do this.

The name NeurIPS has sprung up organically as an alternative acronym, and we’re delighted to see it being adopted. Indeed, one forward-thinking member of the community purchased neurips.com and described the site’s purpose as  “...host[ing] the conference content under a different acronym... until the board catches up.”<p>We’ve caught up! We were considering alternative acronyms when the community support for NeurIPS became apparent.  We ask all attendees this year to respect this solution from the community and to use the new acronym in order that the conference focus can be on science and ideas.<p>We have taken several actions to support this acronym. First, all signage and the program booklet for the 2018 meeting will refer either to the full conference name or to NeurIPS. Second, we’ve asked sponsors to do the same in their materials and publicity, to the extent possible at this late date. Third, we will hire a branding company to design a new logo for the conference. Fourth, we’ve moved the conference site to neurips.cc, and the owner of neurips.com, Peter Henderson, has graciously donated the domain name to the Foundation.<p>Thanks to everyone who has taken the time to share thoughts and concerns regarding this important issue. The Neural Information Processing Systems community has a lot of people working very hard, and with much passion, to make the conference the best it can be.

Now my Manager who&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve been working with has been moved to another product, and I&#x27;m reporting to his Director.<p>So how do I not get lost in the transition?

I have diagnosed anxiety disorders that already make interviews hard, but also feel discouraged from my current situation and pressure from myself to try to get a new job ASAP.<p>I have been applying for the past 6+ months and got plenty of interviews with no offers. But recently I just got a rejection email from my top choice company in the location I desire most. It was a long process I put tons of effort into, and probably my best interview experience ever. But I psyched myself out too much trying to prepare and during the final interview I was a total mess and blew it. Other recent interviews have had similar endings.

This is frustrating on it&#x27;s own, since I want quit my job and build something that I can pour myself into, but I&#x27;m never able to make any meaningful progress between work and family.

So it&#x27;s getting to the point where something has got to give.  My initial thought is to quit my steady decently paying full time job, and move to contract work.  The idea being that since that generally pays more (at the cost of dependable income), in the down time between contracts I could focus on getting my MVP ready.<p>I&#x27;m not having a lot of luck finding contracts though, since I am a generalist and the contract roles I&#x27;ve seen want you to be a specialist (usually in some web technology I haven&#x27;t used much).  I&#x27;ve also looked into places like Upwork, however they don&#x27;t look like they pay enough to be worth the time and effort it would require to put in.<p>Am I just being naive?

I’d also welcome examples of tools that do things particularly well!<p>So far I’ve had&#x2F;implemented a few general ideas:<p>1. Making whitespace-sensitive syntax, like in Python &amp; Haskell, optional syntactic sugar for explicit brackets &amp; separators. It can also be turned off entirely, if e.g. you work with a screenreader and prefer it not need to speak all the indentation.<p>2. Striking a balance between concision and avoiding excessive punctuation-based syntax. I’ve also tried to make sure that visually similar characters have clearly distinct functions, so it’s less likely to mix them up—or if they are typo’d, at least the compiler should reliably detect this and produce a useful diagnostic.<p>3. Working on integration with existing editors (through the Language Server Protocol, an Emacs mode, &amp;c.), so ideally you can continue to use the editor you’re comfortable with that supports your setup.<p>4.

We currently have a ten person overseas engineering team: SCRUM master, technical architect, QA engineer, FE engineer, and backend engineers.<p>I&#x27;m facing an organizational decision about whether or not to start building an in-house team. I&#x27;m looking for guidance on the following aspects of the problem<p>1. Division of labor between in-house and remote: If we do go in this direction, how would you recommend apportioning the work? Would you recommend a separate SCRUM master for an in person team? What if that team was only a couple of people?<p>2. Incremental or All at Once: One option would be to do this incrementally, and hire a couple of people in-house. Another would be to wait until we have a budget available to fully transition the development of our product to an in-house team. This would likely take some time (a year or more?), as hiring in-house for the talent needed would likely cost 3x our current budget.<p>3. Floor Engineering Size: From a morale perspective, I&#x27;m wondering if it would be valuable to start with a minimum amount of technical talent. E.g., one engineer and one designer.<p>4. Starting Talent: Curious if you all have thoughts about starting w&#x2F; a lead engineer&#x2F;tech arch type vs someone who&#x27;s more of a solid contributor. I recognize this decision is heavily influenced by what they&#x27;re working on.<p>Current thoughts on how to move forward:\n1. Hire a smallish team internally: 1 FE eng, 1 BE eng, maybe 1 designer\n2. Focus in-house team on new feature development\n3. Focus remote team on QA and product optimization\n4.

last full time job was a year ago.<p>I barely tolerate my jobs: I resent spending most of my week working on &quot;urgent&quot; tasks that don&#x27;t really matter other than making their requester more political capital so they can play their game of thrones, while my only upside is that I get to keep my job and do more of this.<p>For the last year, I have been tutoring people learning to program. This is rewarding but it&#x27;s only 15h a week and the hourly rate is low: 95% of my after tax income goes to living expenses, and I&#x27;m frugal.<p>I had a three month streak of interviewing this summer and it was so dreadful that I would rather read the dictionary than doing it again. I still check job ads once in a while but don&#x27;t feel very excited about dealing with yet another dysfunctional entity to make the shareholders more money at the expense of my sanity &amp; freedom.<p>I feel stuck, and I&#x27;d rather make as much money as I should as a developer than surviving: this would put me back on track to save for retiring earlier (I&#x27;d like to retire before 40 but only have 25% of the required capital to date.) I have considered self-employment, but I have no network and suck at sales. The only people offering contract work are agencies who are looking for warm bodies to fill seats.<p>I could do this 3 days a week, but sadly no-one ever looks for part time developers: it&#x27;s 8h x 5 days a week or die. I have noticed that when self-employed, I feel differently: there is still crap to put up with, but I feel more in control and don&#x27;t mind as much plus the hourly rate is much higher than an employee and I can get more than 2 weeks a year off.<p>I&#x27;m hoping to hear from people who have been in similar situations: how did you get out of it? How did you reconcile the soul-crushing work prospects with your need for autonomy?

He told us to not worry about it, and eng. should be taking most of our time. Instead of planning how we did everything, we just planned where we wanted to get to &amp; he let us figure it out.

We met deadlines, and we never felt soul-sucking pressure. We were a true team, not just a bunch of coworkers. But 2 months ago he stepped down. It came as a shock, and we believe he was asked to step down because afterward they brought in a SW VP.<p>Since the VP joined we&#x27;ve just been planning. We get emailed on weekends to draw up timelines. We have to do planning for the year, the next 3 months, the next month, and the next sprint, all at the same time. He&#x27;s also hiring some Agile consultants to teach us SW process. He said we need to start measuring success by velocity and accurate story point estimating. We go back and forth about whether story points should be measured in hours or work-units or w&#x2F;e.

Once upon arrival, the customs or the client can check that the seal was not tampered with by public-key cryptography.<p>All the generated public keys would then be stored on an open database, thus making it impossible to reuse the same seal twice (or by having faked seals).<p>What do you think of it ?<p>EDIT: cocaine, not coke","time":1541197418,"title":"Ask HN: Why there are no cryptographic bolt-seals?","type":"story"},{"by":"petethomas","descendants":1,"id":18367191,"kids":[18369302,18368485],"score":30,"time":1541197030,"title":"Roomba I7+ set to start sharing maps of people’s homes with Google","type":"story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2018/10/31/18041876/google-irobot-smart-home-spatial-data-mapping-collaboration"},{"by":"paulpauper","descendants":3,"id":18367038,"kids":[18367359,18367588,18367043],"score":22,"time":1541195274,"title":"Don't get rid of Apu.

have graduated from a top-notch university and joined a big tech company. I started my own business as a side job and eventually got acqui-hired by a bigger startup with ~50 employees (my hiring being the main reason of the acquisition). I joined this bigger startup as their highest paid employee (I wasn&#x27;t named the CTO because the company had a &quot;no roles, no bosses policy&quot;).<p>I was hired mainly due to my experience with high quality &#x2F; scalable code. Soon, a few key employees begun downplaying this ability of mine – for instance, they loved to rewrite the components originally written by myself whenever they could. I would never criticize their work as a way to fight back. The &quot;no bosses, no roles policy&quot; also made things harder for me, since I didn&#x27;t really feel like I could trust anyone.<p>Eventually, I left and took a top management position (reporting to one of the company&#x27;s VPs) at a more established corporation. I gave my best at this new job, building a new development team from scratch and delivered solutions with real business impact throughout the company. My work was recognized, and I became known in the whole company. It felt truly amazing. However, there was one executive that made it clear, from the very beginning, that he didn&#x27;t like me. Things went south recently after a reorg, when he began owning an area I worked closely with and loved the work we did. This executive (who happens to be the CEO’s favorite) begun searching for motives to belittle our work. Things have now gotten to a point where even my boss is refraining from defending us.<p>I had to control myself not to quit this job today (and let go of my bonus). It would be fairly easy for me to find another similar position. However, I wonder if I am lacking some sort of skill. I do notice that I have a hard time saying no and that I generally like pleasing people.

Our users also actively post on our group asking for help from various community members, but also to give feedback about our product. We value the feedback we receive, but often the feedback is polluted with a lot of negative comments from other users. Sadly in some cases, the conversation devolves to unprofessional&#x2F;inappropriate behavior. We do have a staff of volunteers that help us moderate these conversations, but ultimately we are looking to change the tone and habit of the community.<p>Our goal is to share more positive stories, drive our customers to our support team when they need help, encouraging our paying (and more professional customers) to participate and influence our community to have more productive conversations.<p>We are debating internally on several ways to do this. One idea is to start a new Facebook community group, and slowly sunset the old one. The other is to maintain the current community, but be more aggressive about moderating conversations, and proactively post more content. We see many pros and cons with both approaches. We don&#x27;t want to give customers the strong impression that we&#x27;re attempting to cover up or censor our community, but we also feel there are many members of our community that is introducing an unproductive and often mean energy to many conversations.<p>For those of you that maintain your online community, have you ever encountered this problem?

First couple of years of the company we worked in full remote mode. However the results weren&#x27;t great. I then spent over 2 years moving the team into single location (SF) and hiring mostly locally. Worked well, up until couple of our long time employees had to move back home (outside of US) for personal reasons. We wanted to keep them on, so we tried to find a structure that would fit everyone well. This works fine, but as we&#x27;re trying to expand the remote team, we&#x27;re running into some issues.<p>Our current formula is designed around Buffer&#x27;s. We start with a base salary that we would pay for the position in LA (where we are currently based). Then based on numbeo.com we identify the ratio between cost of living where the candidate lives and LA. We apply that to the salary, adjust for health care and that&#x27;s what we pay.<p>Here is an example:\n- $130k base in LA\n- Candidate is in Berlin. Based on https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.numbeo.com&#x2F;cost-of-living&#x2F;compare_cities.jsp?country1=Germany&amp;country2=United+States&amp;city1=Berlin&amp;city2=Los+Angeles%2C+CA&amp;tracking=getDispatchComparison it comes to 3,500.00&#x2F;5,202.64 = 67.27%\n- and we get $87.456 base<p>Where this works ok for more expensive cities (Berlin, Paris, ...) we run into issues for the other ones, where the discrepancy is much more significant, for instance Mexico City.<p>We try to stay fair to all people working for us, including adjusting salaries when they relocate to more expensive areas, covering 30 days of PTO for all workers (remote or on site).<p>Do you find this a fair compensation?

As usual I watched some Netflix while in bed before falling asleep and woke up with the all so familiar sore eyes. This meant that all this time it was not the OLED the one responsible for my headaches, but something else. The only other think that was new both in X and XR was the FaceID.<p>I started thinking how can it cause problems and came with the theory below. When I am at bed the room is really dark and so I set the brightness level on my iPhone to the lowest setting. My eye-pupils are fully dilated to adjust to the lack of light. My theory is that the FaceID illuminator doesn&#x27;t take into consideration the amount of light in the environment and uses the same intensity as if it was daylight.<p>To prove this I took a recording of my iPhone X in similar environment with an IR camera: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;7ewR9wUjnsc<p>If this wasn&#x27;t IR but visible light it would be like the iPhone&#x27;s camera flash going on every 5 seconds right in front of my eyes. There is no question that this would justify the morning soreness and headaches.<p>My question is: Does the IR light emitted by the iPhone &quot;flood illuminator&quot; have the same effect to my retina even thought I don&#x27;t perceive it?","time":1540788431,"title":"Ask HN: Is FaceID harmfull for your eyes?","type":"story"},{"by":"jonbaer","descendants":16,"id":18325063,"kids":[18327175,18328045,18326239,18327482],"score":36,"time":1540787374,"title":"What the Quantum Internet Has in Store","type":"story","url":"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/here-rsquo-s-what-the-quantum-internet-has-in-store/"},{"by":"DiabloD3","descendants":180,"id":18325031,"kids":[18326743,18325449,18326474,18326175,18325475,18325878,18325552,18327216,18327668,18328316,18325651,18328120,18327897,18330881,18328109,18326927,18326781,18326778,18325796,18326693,18325875],"score":271,"time":1540786896,"title":"The EU's Link Tax Will Kill Open Access and Creative Commons News","type":"story","url":"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/10/eus-link-tax-will-kill-open-access-and-creative-commons-news"},{"by":"DiabloD3","descendants":2,"id":18325036,"kids":[18326210,18326111],"score":67,"time":1540786927,"title":"EFF Wins DMCA Exemption Petitions for Tinkering and Repair","type":"story","url":"https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-wins-dmca-exemption-petitions-tinkering-echos-and-repairing-appliances-new"},{"by":"grzm","descendants":78,"id":18324986,"kids":[18333071,18331939,18331883,18331790,18331269,18333734,18332263,18333456,18333252,18334418,18333234,18335281,18342110,18334392,18335790],"score":212,"time":1540786127,"title":"Soup – Alan Kay on Objects","type":"story","url":"http://blog.fogus.me/2018/10/25/soup/"},{"by":"Gigacore","descendants":124,"id":18324997,"kids":[18325070,18325565,18325641,18325186,18325204,18326022,18325325,18325072,18325060,18416645,18357576,18325263,18325101,18326361,18325215,18325067,18325124,18325791,18327880,18325120,18325514],"score":212,"time":1540786260,"title":"Lion Air crash: Boeing 737 plane crashes in sea off Jakarta","type":"story","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-46014463"},{"by":"kimsk112","descendants":10,"id":18324582,"kids":[18324619,18329939],"score":8,"time":1540780398,"title":"Gab.com is under attack","type":"story","url":"https://gab.ai/"},{"by":"dgudkov","dead":true,"id":18324491,"kids":[18324991,18324959,18325004,18324972,18324975],"score":16,"time":1540779161,"title":"If You Ignore the News, America Actually Seems Pretty Nice","type":"story","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-10-26/road-trip-america-takes-us-beyond-news-media-politics"},{"by":"jkuria","descendants":4,"id":18324490,"kids":[18333311,18333759,18334063],"score":50,"time":1540779161,"title":"Phillis Wheatley","type":"story","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillis_Wheatley"},{"by":"brian_herman","descendants":2,"id":18324418,"kids":[18329942,18324432],"score":3,"text":"While transfering files I find that taring the file and sending the tarred file over connections is faster than using sftp and such is there a program that will use rsync or sftp and send a tarred stream of data and untar it on the other side?","time":1540777878,"title":"Rsync with tar on both sides","type":"story"},{"by":"daenz","descendants":184,"id":18324415,"kids":[18324617,18324689,18324862,18324872,18324509,18324763,18324812,18324657,18324742,18324527,18324577,18324844,18324745,18324654,18327003,18325480,18325473,18324813,18324780,18324824,18324507,18324776,18324645,18324656,18324614,18324554],"score":113,"time":1540777851,"title":"GoDaddy to suspend domain name Gab.com tomorrow","type":"story","url":"https://twitter.com/getongab/status/1056708683130781696"},{"by":"zornslemma","descendants":8,"id":18324351,"kids":[18325580,18331347,18325908,18345398,18341309,18327741,18325211,18325161],"score":7,"text":"Due to a project I was working on no longer needing the resources, I currently own several servers with up to date hardware.

by yesterday&#x27;s article on smartphone addiction, I would like to \npropose one idea and ask for other ideas about making HN in particular, and \nthe thinkpiece&#x2F;newspaper WWW in general, more useful to the persons reading \nthem.<p>I feel like I spent a large amount of time reading texts on the internet in a \nway that didn&#x27;t serve me, or by extension any community I want to be part of. \nI can imagine many people here feel the same. I think I can understand the \nreason: The interest of any person writing a text online is not to contribute \nto a view of the world that is accurate and useful to the reader, but to make \nthe text being paid attention and&#x2F;or money to. This is often accomplished by \nmaking readers outraged about things that don&#x27;t concern them and that they \nwon&#x27;t change anything about.<p>Of course, making this attempt transparent to the reader would be \ncounterproductive, so an excuse with some level of subtility will be used (as \nan example, &quot;a 20 page slatestarcodex article about studies into in how far \nthe gender pay gap is caused&#x2F;not caused by women&#x27;s choices&quot;). This is adapted \nto the target group. But in general, if a professional journalist (or \npolitical advocate) tries to do this against someone with a different career \n(like me or you), they can probably win. And unsurprisingly, such a discussion \nisn&#x27;t contained e.g. in New York Times articles about smartphone addiction.<p>I feel HN (and the WWW in general) is useful to me, but the use is diminished \nby articles of this form. I want to ask for ideas helping to change this. One \nidea would be the following: A reader on HN can not only upvote articles for \nquality, but, if they have a suspicion that the author makes (significant) use \nof such a trick, they can upvote for outrageousness as well. Then we could set \nto hide articles above a certain outrageousness level. What do you think will happen if such a proposal is implemented?","time":1540624812,"title":"Idea against HN-induced smartphone addiction","type":"story"},{"by":"chilledheat","descendants":83,"id":18314708,"kids":[18314741,18314759,18314737,18314757,18314921,18314832,18316233,18314721,18314895,18315074,18314862,18314731,18314891],"score":42,"time":1540624904,"title":"VW CEO says they’ll have ‘EVs as good as Tesla’s for half the price by 2020’","type":"story","url":"https://electrek.co/2018/10/26/vw-ceo-electric-vehicle-tesla-half-price-2020/"},{"by":"fuzzythinker","descendants":203,"id":18314628,"kids":[18315135,18315128,18316072,18316746,18316139,18315036,18315045,18315226,18314959,18315562,18315029,18315527,18315233,18315380,18314881,18316532,18314926,18316344,18315017,18315207,18315904,18318336,18317729,18315119,18315285,18317957,18315632,18315959,18315301,18329024,18315591,18314962,18315141,18315234],"score":261,"time":1540622452,"title":"Fear, trust and JavaScript: When types and functional programming fail","type":"story","url":"https://www.reaktor.com/blog/fear-trust-and-javascript/"},{"by":"asplake","descendants":64,"id":18314555,"kids":[18314878,18314622,18315293,18316359,18316658,18315874,18315724,18315242,18315712,18314938,18318587,18315058,18315294,18315554,18316769],"score":598,"time":1540620139,"title":"The Periodic Table of Data Structures [pdf]","type":"story","url":"https://stratos.seas.harvard.edu/files/stratos/files/periodictabledatastructures.pdf"},{"by":"ribasushi","descendants":61,"id":18314545,"kids":[18315790,18316402,18315512,18314991,18316142,18317349,18317466,18315598,18315551,18316246,18316871,18316864,18316281,18316146,18321094,18317222,18316472,18316219,18315386,18316946,18316383,18315785,18315152,18316709,18315281],"score":240,"time":1540619788,"title":"What the hell happened to Darius Miles?","type":"story","url":"https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/what-the-hell-happened-to-darius-miles"},{"by":"gymshoes","descendants":3,"id":18314487,"kids":[18326687,18314496,18314554],"score":2,"text":"I was reading a healthline artice and saw that the post had been medically verified by a doctor.<p>What are more sites like this where the posts have been reviewed and have references?","time":1540618109,"title":"Ask HN: What are some blogs whose posts are reviewed by professional experts?","type":"story"},{"by":"Ibethewalrus","descendants":91,"id":18314201,"kids":[18314375,18314342,18314482,18314324,18314332,18314304,18314307,18314380,18314396,18314344,18314347,18314268,18314389,18314308],"score":61,"time":1540610799,"title":"Airbnb can’t go on unregulated – it does too much damage to cities","type":"story","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/24/airbnb-unregulated-damage-cities-barcelona-law-locals"},{"by":"mattehr","descendants":3,"id":18314197,"kids":[18314266,18314734],"score":2,"text":"Hey HN.<p>After recently getting my financial &#x27;shit&#x27; together.

This is an antipattern!<p>* Business priorities are changing every sprint &#x2F; product owner is getting arm twisted to add new &quot;fields&quot; , so that department X can get more  out of this app<p>* The relational model could cause added maintenance and refactoring when new changes come around<p>However I have concerns against suggesting this:<p>* I am in a junior heavy team, with noobies<p>* Seniors are scared of new practices.<p>* I don&#x27;t know how easy it is to do things like business reporting etc.<p>* It would mean a heavy refactor of the internal models<p>* How do I transplant existing data on production into a new DB technology?<p>* I have very little experience in NoSQL<p>Looking for people&#x27;s thoughts or suggestions.","time":1540502006,"title":"Ask HN: I think I need to use NoSQL?","type":"story"},{"by":"fomopop","descendants":2,"id":18304586,"kids":[18304898,18304778],"score":2,"time":1540501553,"title":"Ask HN: What API do you wish existed?","type":"story"},{"by":"antimora","descendants":7,"id":18304486,"kids":[18312922,18318185,18312471,18313439,18307683,18308296],"score":28,"time":1540500704,"title":"Google sacks dozens over sexual harassment","type":"story","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45986510"},{"by":"erwan","descendants":5,"id":18304365,"kids":[18304885,18304965,18305140],"score":22,"time":1540499753,"title":"Catullus 16","type":"story","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catullus_16"},{"by":"tysone","descendants":323,"id":18304329,"kids":[18305445,18304983,18304826,18304783,18308054,18304816,18304980,18304767,18304799,18305081,18304782,18304680,18304851,18304969,18304728,18304824,18304897,18305122,18304895,18305097,18305064,18305912,18307997,18305923,18304838,18305327,18304999,18305590,18304860,18305150,18306012,18307468,18304993,18305904,18320197,18305069,18308144,18307990,18305182,18304834,18333961,18306929,18305123,18305019,18313026,18304719,18306443,18310698,18306449,18313846,18307918],"score":255,"time":1540499480,"title":"At Netflix, Radical Transparency and Blunt Firings Unsettle the Ranks","type":"story","url":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-netflix-radical-transparency-and-blunt-firings-unsettle-the-ranks-1540497174"},{"by":"wuschel","descendants":4,"id":18304314,"kids":[18307739,18306043],"score":22,"time":1540499416,"title":"SciLua: Scientific Computing with LuaJIT","type":"story","url":"http://scilua.org/"},{"by":"smartmic","dead":true,"id":18304295,"kids":[18304687,18304726,18304721],"score":20,"time":1540499280,"title":"Shadow IT","type":"story","url":"http://www.softpanorama.org/Admin/shadow_it.shtml"},{"by":"petermcneeley","descendants":41,"id":18304234,"kids":[18307032,18304787,18305699,18305305,18304882,18308622,18306376],"score":64,"time":1540498794,"title":"Validating UTF8 Strings via Lookup Tables","type":"story","url":"http://darkcephas.blogspot.com/2018/10/validating-utf8-strings-with-lookup.html"},{"by":"tareqak","descendants":7,"id":18304200,"kids":[18304544,18304203,18304527],"score":17,"time":1540498466,"title":"Google CEO memo says 48 fired for sexual misconduct","type":"story","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/25/google-ceo-memo-says-48-fired-for-sexual-misconduct.html"},{"by":"Hooke","descendants":30,"id":18304075,"kids":[18304667,18304609,18304596,18304642,18310877,18304529,18319011,18304713,18304482,18304727],"score":49,"time":1540497534,"title":"In a new study, those who ate more organic food had fewer cancer diagnoses","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/23/well/eat/can-eating-organic-food-lower-your-cancer-risk.html"},{"by":"acob","descendants":3,"id":18304112,"kids":[18304380,18305228],"score":3,"time":1540497773,"title":"Down the Rabbit Hole That Is Austrian Economics – Simply Explained","type":"story","url":"https://achainofblocks.com/2018/09/01/austrian-economics-explained-beginners/"},{"by":"sinak","descendants":343,"id":18303560,"kids":[18303712,18302700,18302861,18302976,18305216,18302744,18302756,18303865,18302876,18302770,18303983,18302825,18303880,18305633,18304317,18302992,18303660,18306999,18304164,18304437,18306837,18304398,18303832,18310806,18304007,18303665,18303095,18303187,18304083,18307611,18312478,18303680,18304197,18303784,18303177,18307272,18306329,18302924],"score":1064,"time":1540493924,"title":"Copyright Office Ruling Imposes Sweeping Right to Repair Reforms","type":"story","url":"https://ifixit.org/blog/11951/1201-copyright-final-rule/"},{"by":"jamescostian","descendants":2,"id":18303606,"kids":[18307014,18304113],"score":8,"text":"Last night I was having dinner with my girlfriend and my phone gave me a notification saying something like &quot;Silenced your phone for Dinner with $HER_FIRST_NAME $HER_LAST_INITIAL&quot; (with the variables replaced)<p>The notification came from an app I&#x27;ve had for a while that puts my phone on silent when I have a calendar event, but I never made a calendar event for having dinner with my girlfriend.

Simple http servers are something I&#x27;ve got spoiled with as well.  I didn&#x27;t care a ton for node.js when I dabbled, but the &lt; 40 lines required to have a http server with an endpoint up was handy.  I had the same experience when playing with Go, but I haven&#x27;t really caught up with it&#x27;s usability in the last two years, maybe it has the sort of ecosystem I&#x27;m looking for.<p>I might be asking for a silver bullet that doesn&#x27;t exist and I need to further tune where I&#x27;m willing to compromise for a single solution.  FWIW, I&#x27;ve grown quite fond of the Swift closure style syntax, and just the process of writing Swift and Go both stand out to me as more positive experiences syntactically, as opposed to Java&#x2F;Obj-C&#x2F;C.","time":1540428902,"title":"Ask HN: What's a strong “use everywhere” language for smaller problems?","type":"story"},{"by":"danso","descendants":162,"id":18297724,"kids":[18298932,18297955,18298097,18297967,18299319,18298313,18298898,18300434,18298027,18299596,18298887,18302082,18300042,18298048],"score":415,"time":1540428206,"title":"First analysis of ‘pre-registered’ studies shows sharp rise in null findings","type":"story","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07118-1"},{"by":"sexy_seedbox","descendants":55,"id":18297608,"kids":[18297810,18297850,18297966,18298245,18300635,18297948,18298414,18297641,18299499,18299879,18300566,18297864],"score":69,"time":1540426715,"title":"Cathay Pacific flags data breach affecting 9.4M passengers","type":"story","url":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cathay-pacific-cyber/cathay-pacific-flags-data-breach-affecting-94-million-passengers-idUSKCN1MY26L"},{"by":"smacktoward","descendants":171,"id":18297591,"kids":[18298168,18300964,18300442,18298470,18298431,18298894,18298778,18298445,18300649,18300620,18298347,18297998,18297979,18306025,18299163,18299812,18300150,18298607,18298155,18298256,18300778,18299364,18300953,18305105,18309386,18299091,18298767,18299186,18308289,18300529,18301509,18299607,18300826,18298438,18299417,18299937,18299336,18301616,18298132,18298862,18298390,18298590],"score":237,"time":1540426422,"title":"Is Gutenberg the End or a New Beginning for WordPress?","type":"story","url":"https://deliciousbrains.com/wordpress-gutenberg/"},{"by":"juokaz","dead":true,"id":18297540,"kids":[18297778,18297807,18297679,18298181,18297654,18297787,18297920],"score":17,"time":1540425691,"title":"Amazons move off Oracle caused Prime Day outage in one of its biggest warehouses","type":"story","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/23/amazon-move-off-oracle-caused-prime-day-outage-in-warehouse.html"},{"by":"thrower123","descendants":19,"id":18297514,"kids":[18297952,18297848,18297901,18297933,18297527,18298230,18297892],"score":34,"time":1540425418,"title":"SQLite Code of Ethics","type":"story","url":"https://sqlite.org/codeofethics.html"},{"by":"MohamedFAhmed","descendants":4,"id":18297440,"kids":[18301965,18297607],"score":3,"text":"Folks,<p>Do you think you are spending too much cash on cloud service?

I am from Spain, 19, and M. I graduated from HS 1 year ago and went to a what is considered a 2nd-tier Uni here in Spain to study CS, because my grades in HS and the SAT were bad.<p>I had never actually “coded” or had done anything remotely CS related before I went to Uni.<p>I chose CS mainly because I’ve always been interested in tech but just let’s just say in the “consumer-oriented” aspect of it, never really having acquired a useful skill throughout all the years I’ve spent in front of a PC being an introvert in HS, other than I guess ENG. And so, during my 1st semester I failed all of my finals.<p>I also don’t know how to study or actually learn things by the way.<p>I failed all of my finals because of a combination of reasons, but I’d say the biggest one by far is my own laziness and lack of will to actually work, and also me not being “smart” when it comes down to math and such, with which I’ve struggled all my life, which makes you think “oh, why did you go into CS, then”.<p>Now, after dropping outta Uni this last June, I’m staying at my parents’ home for a year, getting my driver’s license and such and preparing for Vocational School next year, which I couldn’t get into this year because in my region of Spain you could only apply during the Month of May and I fucked up.\nI am planning to choose “Web Development”, but I haven’t done anything throughout this last summer and up until now.\nDuring all my years in HS I also lied to other people about who I was. I even told them I made trailers for DICE and made money online, so now I have no friends I can speak in town where my parents live because other than the fact that they’re all in university I am ashamed of all of those lies I told and the false persona I created to justify my introversion. I’m depressed, in a way.

In the first case the code incurs a performance penalty for every invocation. In the latter there is no performance hit however the call stack must be kept completely unchanged. This doesn&#x27;t seem to match the experience one achieves with SBCL on Linux where calls don&#x27;t seem to be slowed down and one can recompile just some forms in the middle of the stack. It seems that in some way the CL compiler could update also the call stack. The only other language that reaches the same level of interactivity is Smalltalk for which however I know only about of single-threaded implementations.

More importantly, 50% of our profits will be shared with our members and charity. That means we’re going to pay you to drink alkaline water while we ensure everyone on Earth has access to safe drinking water. Our market is worth more than a trillion dollars annually and we’re going to start building the first version of our software application soon. Our unique insight is that we will earn greater profits paying people to drink water than was ever possible while selling it. Furthermore, this process can be duplicated with any product or service that’s renewable, that collects data, or can be produced at near zero marginal cost. We have a fast-growing team that consists of entrepreneurs, software engineers, and a lobbyist. We’re looking for $8,000,000 to create our first micro-factory, 3 high volume kiosks, cashless vending machines, and our ecosystem. This will allow us to distribute 61,000,000 beverages the first year with a minimum revenue of $28,856,657. And finally, FreeWater is only the beginning. Our vision is a highly profitable universal income that will ensure everyone has access to everything that’s needed to live a fulfilled life!

A very large tech company reached out to me about an open contract role on their marketing team in my hometown, and began a series of interviews (four total) culminating with a submitted project that I completed for them to get a better idea of my skillset.<p>Two weeks after submitting the application, I received no response. I reached out to the hiring manager (who would also be &quot;the boss&quot; were I to get hired) and they commented that they had to tie up loose ends with HR.<p>Another week goes by. I reach out again, and received a response a few days later, that hiring for this role has been paused indefinitely.<p>On Monday, I noticed a new role posted. It&#x27;s now a full-time role, though responsibilities are largely the same. I reach out to the same Hiring Manager, and they confirmed it is on their team.<p>So I applied and let them know that I&#x27;m keen to re-start our conversation, especially given I&#x27;ve had four conversations with them and others on their team. Now, I&#x27;ve received an automated rejection to my application.<p>Frankly, I&#x27;m surprised such a large org can mismanage their hiring process to this point, and am thinking about reaching out to their HR team to get a better understanding of what exactly happened. I worked very hard on my submitted project, and an opportunity on this team and at this company would be massive, but I&#x27;m really shocked and upset about how this transpired.<p>Is it worth it to reach out to HR to, at the very least, get feedback on my work and interviews? I put a lot of time and effort researching this org, and working on the project they asked of me, and to get nothing from it really makes me feel like shit.<p>Thanks

joined one of the big-4 tech companies a month ago after years of freelance work. Since joining, I’ve had trouble “hooking in”. For one, it doesn’t seem like I have all that much to do. I’ve submitted a few very simple bug fixes, and I have some larger feature work coming up, but it’s all on the order of maybe a few hundred lines of code. I’ve also spent maybe a week more than I should have on a fairly simple feature, just from fighting with my tools and trying to figure out where to put a few sparse calls in the codebase. It’s really embarrassing.<p>The other issue is that I’m riddled with anxiety every day. For one, I’m worried that my coworkers might think I’m slacking off, or that I’m incompetent or a bad hire. Everyone around me is always on point though many of them are younger than me. Their thoughts are completely clear. I rarely hear them make mistakes or misunderstand anything: they seem to have no weaknesses. In contrast, my thoughts tend to be extremely muddled. I often take in information without making much sense of it at first, and it seems to take me a while to clarify these thoughts into some whole. (And even then, I’m not always able to talk about it clearly.) I think this has always been my way of thinking, but it feels out of place here..<p>The other big issue is that I don’t really know how to reach out to people. I’m not a collaborator; I’m a recluse. In my life, I’ve always done things from scratch. Now I have to make meetings, ask people for information, decide that something needs to be done and tell another team to do it, etc. To get good at this, it feels like I basically have to rewire my entire personality, and I don’t know how to go about doing this. I’ve also found myself not asking clarifying questions when something doesn’t make sense in a meeting—see “muddled thoughts” above—and then I’m stuck figuring out whatever it was that I misunderstood on my own time (or not at all).<p>I don’t know if this is impostor syndrome, because I might actually <i>be</i> an impostor. Deep down, I think I’m riddled with fear that I’m just not good enough to be a “Googler” (or your favorite FANG here).<p>What do I do?

It&#x27;s more for if you already know the math and don&#x27;t want to forget it. Each question has a corresponding entry in the appendix so you&#x27;re never left hanging. New problems and appendix sections get added each post.

I started the math website because I saw, that at least for me, there was a need for a math knowledge retention website that was not being met anywhere else. I realized that while I might never be able to make any contributions to machine learning directly I might be able to help more by helping people learn and retain the math.<p>But so far the response has been luke warm. There are a few good guys contributing but in general it feels like there is no interest. I&#x27;ve emailed and wrote letters to about 30 local high school and college math departments asking if anyone would be willing to help and I got no responses.<p>I don&#x27;t want to give up on the site but I absolutely do not want to be the moron who dumps a ton of energy into something no one has any interest in.<p>I&#x27;ve lost my ability to evaluate my devotion to this project.

The author noted how he wished there were more discussion on HN about building—like in the community’s early days.<p>That same thought has run through my mind for a while, now. I used to visit HN several times a day, as the content felt so relevant. I still find interesting things to read here, but it’s less related to what I work on.<p>I do visit IH, but it’s not as good as HN once was. I joined FounderCafe, which has useful discussions—but isn’t particularly active.<p>I don’t mean to complain. I’m sure that others prefer how HN is now. That said, I keep wondering if others share this sentiment. I work somewhat in isolation, and enjoy this sort of online discussion. I also find it motivational to read about other’s experiences while building stuff.<p>In part, I wonder if this sort of discussion could be fostered on HN.

I even have a Google recruiter badgering me to interview for a SW engineer role. But the thing I keep coming back to is, Am I making the right decision by pivoting to SW.

First was a food social mobile platform. Think IG Story x Yelp. Took me a year to build from concept, design, coding, marketing, etc. I would say it&#x27;s a good portion of Snap’s mobile app interface, built out by 1.5 developers (1 being me).<p>Then did a Bitcoin LN Wallet, from concept, design to code, took only 2 months.<p>I am quite proud of both, even tho they were anything but commercial successes. With funds running low, I spent the past 3 months looking for employment. Hoping these polished project will shine me in good light.<p>Was I completely wrong. Nobody cares. Being a bootstrap developer I admit I am not the most academic when it comes to the projects. I was from an EE background from school, and was in embedded Firmware for almost a decade. I didn&#x27;t know creating a 3rd table to track Reputation&#x2F;Likes between a user and a Story is a database concept called &#x27;Joint Table&#x27;. I have no idea that creating an equation to decay reputation inputs is called &#x27;Freshness&#x27;. I’ve done hundreds of things in the year. I can barely remember half them, let alone with precise terminology in a time constraint settings. One thing I can show is everything is open sourced on Github. If point questions are asked about my demo, I can reference my code and explain everything.<p>It seems like in today&#x27;s world, nobody cares about experiences or what real product you have launched. It’s all about algorithmic puzzles in 45 min and describe hypothetical systems with academic terms. I can build an entire social media MVP by myself. But I can&#x27;t get a job maintaining Settings menu for a (shall be unnamed) unicorn with a very similar app, which said app needing a headcount of 3k to keep running...<p>My advise is, if your side project didn&#x27;t become entrepreneur success, they are useless dead-weights.

All answers will be helpful for me and other people in my situation.<p>I am a developer. My previous company gave us a free hand on how we organized. We worked directly with project sponsors and sometimes they had very concrete requirements about how things should work. Sounds worse than micromanagement. On the other hand, there was culture that we should tell them about unaddressed issues and design solutions to overcome them.

It feels like project management is duty of SM, PO and development team.<p>The process is heavy, we are forced to give estimates, give input on content of user stories and write down tasks. Tasks are locked for the duration of sprint even if these stop making sense after two days. I feel there is perverted need to predict what is going to happen next week and complete disregard for historical data.<p>Developers are also very eager to discuss how scrum team should fill Jira tickets to maximise their psychological comfort. We are also shielded from stakeholders and when one talked with a dev it was a &quot;disaster&quot;. There is an obsession with minutiae like keeping the sanctity of daily standup duration, getting five extra minutes &quot;ruins the productivity&quot;. I lost it when devs requested a reverse digital twin of Jira board with post-its.

Not only is PMO happy with &quot;predictable&quot; and &quot;well-defined&quot; process but also developers are enthusiastic because they work in ego-fuelling &quot;best possible&quot; framework.<p>Am I missing something?

I&#x27;ve been working at a startup since I graduated a couple years ago, and I really like it. The startup is doing well, and I make 120k cash and my options are valued at about ~35k per year (we just raised a Series B).<p>I haven&#x27;t interviewed anywhere since starting this job, and I wasn&#x27;t really planning on leaving until this microsoft interview fell into my lap. I&#x27;m still waiting on the details of the offer, since they make you pick a team prior to discussing compensation etc.<p>My questions are:<p>1. Do you think Microsoft&#x27;s reputation on my resume is similar to a Facebook &#x2F; Google? E.g., do you think it will help me get more senior positions at companies after my tenure there?<p>2. Is Microsoft&#x27;s compensation on par with FB&#x2F;Google? My college roommate just started at FB and makes at 250k a year all in (stocks + signing bonus + $$), is that a reasonable ask at microsoft as well?<p>3. How would you value startup options that were pre Series A after a startup has raised a Series B? Most signs at my current company are positive, although there are certainly some scaling issues.<p>4. My second year annual review &#x2F; raise is upcoming at work. Is it considered poor form to bring this microsoft offer to the table and ask for more money &#x2F; whatever else I might want (e.g. more vacation, more options)?<p>5. Can I negotiate this Microsoft offer to its max without offers from other big companies?

I don&#x27;t understand how this ever made it past QA.<p>If you work at Facebook, fix this right now.","time":1539049767,"title":"Tell HN: Forwarded Facebook emails automatically login as recipient","type":"story"},{"by":"dickeytk","descendants":247,"id":18172689,"kids":[18173409,18173667,18174698,18174080,18173176,18173775,18173585,18173177,18173207,18173143,18174049,18179118,18174114,18173327,18173429,18173690,18173343,18175740,18174808,18173137,18173587,18173086,18173170,18174135,18174260,18176840,18176057,18173950,18173198,18175305,18175559,18174504,18174249,18174402,18173188,18175194],"score":524,"time":1539048492,"title":"12 Factor CLI Apps","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@jdxcode/12-factor-cli-apps-dd3c227a0e46"},{"by":"pseudolus","dead":true,"id":18172757,"kids":[18173008,18172986],"score":4,"time":1539049666,"title":"The Rise and Fall of Affirmative Action","type":"story","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/15/the-rise-and-fall-of-affirmative-action"},{"by":"Mizza","descendants":197,"id":18172720,"kids":[18173663,18172762,18175990,18173481,18173628,18173666,18174092,18176186,18173496,18178373,18173276,18175280,18173357,18175108,18173464,18173242,18174472,18179370,18181166,18174185,18180561,18173919,18176172,18177867,18176321,18176305],"score":225,"time":1539048879,"title":"The Economics of a Commune in the Ozarks","type":"story","url":"https://www.eastwindblog.co/?p=1245"},{"by":"Artnome","descendants":102,"id":18172665,"kids":[18175378,18175201,18176137,18175118,18175207,18175462,18175220,18175268,18175208,18175449,18175360,18175160,18175817,18178277,18175402,18176605,18175134,18175584,18175461,18175052,18175521],"score":100,"time":1539048166,"title":"Myth Busting Banksy","type":"story","url":"https://www.artnome.com/news/2018/10/6/myth-busting-banksy"},{"by":"pattrn","descendants":4,"id":18172654,"kids":[18172721,18174126],"score":8,"time":1539048039,"title":"Good Code Depends on Good Names","type":"story","url":"https://stephenmann.io/post/good-code-depends-on-good-names/"},{"by":"empressplay","descendants":26,"id":18172532,"kids":[18174401,18174245,18173608,18174326,18174363,18174015,18174332,18174502,18174990,18174286,18173948],"score":64,"time":1539046233,"title":"We See Facts: The BBC’s Ceefax Teletext Service","type":"story","url":"https://paleotronic.com/2018/10/09/we-see-facts-the-bbcs-ceefax-teletext-service/"},{"by":"andygcook","descendants":130,"id":18172642,"kids":[18173529,18173300,18174499,18175935,18175034,18174890,18173265,18173283,18173489,18173612,18173577,18173390,18176529,18177017,18176541,18178110,18175253,18175826,18178546,18175404],"score":209,"time":1539047857,"title":"The New Atlanta Billionaires Behind the Unlikely Tech Unicorn MailChimp","type":"story","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2018/10/08/the-new-atlanta-billionaires-behind-an-unlikely-tech-unicorn"},{"by":"Firebrand","descendants":12,"id":18172518,"kids":[18176537,18176301,18177469,18179679,18177752],"score":28,"time":1539046085,"title":"44 siblings and counting","type":"story","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/health/44-donor-siblings-and-counting/?noredirect=on"},{"by":"sophiebits","descendants":62,"id":18172453,"kids":[18173505,18174624,18172943,18173425,18172801,18172942,18173234,18175535,18173183,18179711,18172962,18183656,18187679,18178668,18185474,18174171,18173572,18183347,18176471,18173232,18175501,18173543,18172820,18173662,18174800,18177992,18180067,18172480,18173433,18174845],"score":96,"text":"I work on React.

I live in a friends circle with a lot of bodybuilders, eating 0 carb, high pro, high fat diet. I tried reducing my carb intake. I felt generally good, but nothing significant.

I found some evidence for unhealthy people: [1], [2], [7].<p>When I searched about people who support this diet I found two interesting things. For one, these people (as seen in this [3] reddit thread) are convinced that modern society likes the taste of carbs and feel &quot;safe&quot; eating plants, so people don&#x27;t want to spend money on researching keto diet (as seen in that thread). I&#x27;m skeptical of this since research institutes do research on things public is not generally interested in.<p>Second, proponents of this diet seem to think this diet is practiced by ancient humans before agriculture.

Everyone,<p>I&#x27;m about to become a first time father and I&#x27;ve been thinking about how to go about documenting my son&#x27;s life.  By documenting, I mean collecting all of the pictures&#x2F;videos we take of him along with text descriptions of the events.  Things like what we did for his 3rd birthday, his first words, when his Grandma died, etc.  A sort of official record of everything that happened to him during his life.  The idea being that when he&#x27;s an adult he will have all of this in one place to go back to and look at when he wants.<p>The three main things I&#x27;m looking for are:<p>1) General Social Network stuff like uploading a post, pictures, etc.  Possibly allowing other family members to contribute\n2) The ability to download everything (pictures, posts, videos, etc.) into a single archive that comes with a html file that can be locally viewed\n3) Something I can expect to exist 20 years from now<p>2 &amp; 3 effectively eliminate every commercial site and anything that isn&#x27;t open source in my mind.<p>My googling hasn&#x27;t come up with anything that I think is suitable.  I&#x27;ve come up with a few options:<p>(1) A self hosted Mastodon instance not connected to the fediverse. Mastodon has the most momentum behind it, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the focus I want.  It&#x27;s more for short thoughts that are relevant for a relatively short amount of time.<p>(2) Creating my own site based on the ActivityPub standard.  This is attractive because it gives me something to start on and would allow me to hook into the fediverse, if it ever really takes off.  However, I can&#x27;t seem to find a good basic ActivityPub library (preferrably Ruby&#x2F;RoR) to use and rolling my own seems complicated.<p>(3) Creating the site from scratch based on my own data format.  This is the simplest to get started, but it&#x27;s going to be lacking in a lot of features and I&#x27;ll spend a lot of time reinventing the wheel.<p>Anyone have thoughts or suggestions?","time":1539017991,"title":"Ask HN: Documenting my child's life","type":"story"},{"by":"szczys","descendants":225,"id":18169087,"kids":[18170364,18169978,18170307,18171216,18169542,18172329,18175140,18169925,18170231,18173043,18173217,18177007,18171678,18169515,18172718,18171123,18170239],"score":162,"time":1539017831,"title":"FAA Moves Toward Treating Drones and Planes as Equals","type":"story","url":"https://hackaday.com/2018/10/08/will-drones-and-planes-be-treated-as-equals-by-faa/"},{"by":"lainon","descendants":19,"id":18169091,"kids":[18171554,18176979,18173931,18173101],"score":59,"time":1539017849,"title":"Notes on using git-replace to get rid of giant objects","type":"story","url":"https://blog.plover.com/prog/git-replace.html"},{"by":"tysone","descendants":258,"id":18169027,"kids":[18169600,18171500,18173342,18169083,18173457,18169313,18169393,18169527,18171306,18169492,18174289,18170043,18172816,18169080,18169195,18172628,18169351,18169355,18172767,18169069,18169575,18169324,18169317,18169813,18172901,18172260,18172177,18172108,18169101,18171921,18169713,18169162,18171339,18169133],"score":953,"time":1539017387,"title":"Google Exposed User Data, Feared Repercussions of Disclosing to Public","type":"story","url":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-exposed-user-data-feared-repercussions-of-disclosing-to-public-1539017194"},{"by":"dqv","descendants":2,"id":18169144,"kids":[18169229,18169475],"score":3,"text":"Hi,<p>An acquaintance&#x27;s daughter is on the Autism spectrum.

I know that everything is case-by-case with unique learning needs, but if you have anything, I&#x27;d really appreciate it.<p>Thanks","time":1539018099,"title":"Ask HN: Programming resources for people with poor reading comprehension","type":"story"},{"by":"wpmoradi","descendants":28,"id":18168829,"kids":[18169799,18169238,18170952,18169627,18170317,18169865,18178158,18169648,18173974,18171239,18173732,18170552,18170529,18169357,18171432,18168910,18171171],"score":73,"time":1539016123,"title":"Ask HN: Whats the best way to learn C++ for Deep learning?","type":"story"},{"by":"troydavis","descendants":86,"id":18168720,"kids":[18169371,18169012,18169307,18169649,18174612,18170158,18169798,18173640,18169128,18171507,18169268,18169531,18169014,18169716,18175046,18174322,18173860,18174045,18174369,18171481,18184264,18171307,18169322,18171558,18174087,18171938,18169792,18171984,18174328,18171499,18169394],"score":517,"time":1539015311,"title":"Today Is My Wife’s First Birthday Since She Died","type":"story","url":"https://medium.com/@webwright/today-is-my-wifes-first-birthday-since-she-died-7369944c43ec"},{"by":"wstrange","descendants":43,"id":18168691,"kids":[18172915,18174271,18175388,18173408,18173335,18173387],"score":86,"time":1539015149,"title":"Reified Generics: The Search for the Cure","type":"story","url":"https://gbracha.blogspot.com/2018/10/reified-generics-search-for-cure.html"},{"by":"yanis_t","descendants":9,"id":18168659,"kids":[18172688,18168871,18168699],"score":20,"time":1539014899,"title":"Show HN: A personal task manager with multiple trello-like projects","type":"story","url":"https://todox.app/"},{"by":"Tomte","descendants":219,"id":18168622,"kids":[18168901,18168973,18169820,18168997,18169741,18169233,18168929,18168992,18168898,18172728,18169245,18172827,18168904,18169474,18169188,18169378,18172004,18169994,18173037,18169346,18169562,18169287],"score":217,"time":1539014668,"title":"Intel Announces 9th Gen Core CPUs","type":"story","url":"https://www.anandtech.com/show/13401/intel-9th-gen-cpus-9900k-9700k-9600k"},{"by":"devy","descendants":5,"id":18168600,"kids":[18169253,18171371,18169017],"score":11,"time":1539014504,"title":"Chinese spy chip: Four more reasons to believe Apple's denial","type":"story","url":"https://9to5mac.com/2018/10/08/chinese-spy-chip-2/"},{"by":"ceronman","descendants":2,"id":18168574,"kids":[18174587,18168755],"score":1,"text":"I&#x27;m not referring to the typical CLI application that you call from the command prompt with some arguments and wait for the output.

I thought that with X&#x27;s domain knowledge and with my tech expertise we could form a synergy that would drive the company big.<p>We brainstormed a few ideas and decided to quickly build prototypes and iterate over our ideas. But when it came to execution, X just wouldn&#x27;t do anything - wouldn&#x27;t talk to clients, wouldn&#x27;t talk to investors, wouldn&#x27;t discuss strategy with me, wouldn&#x27;t come up with a product plan, wouldn&#x27;t discuss features, wouldn&#x27;t do anything at all. X always made excuses of being sick or having family emergencies.<p>I had to align X&#x27;s energy into building the company several times. After a point I realised that X was not motivated in running the company at all. When I threatened him with the idea of leaving the company, he didn&#x27;t confront me. Rather, he accepted that he was not motivated and he came up with an excuse of why he wasn&#x27;t able to perform.<p>Last month we shut down the company. Now I&#x27;m back to searching for jobs again. I&#x27;d like to know if it&#x27;s okay to speak about your co-founder&#x27;s incompetence to a prospective employer? I&#x27;d like to be honest with my prospective employer. I&#x27;m also willing to accept my mistake of not being able to judge a person&#x27;s competency. But then again I also know that badmouthing can get me in trouble.<p>How do I position myself when someone asks me: &quot;why did you close your previous company?&quot;<p>PS: I&#x27;ve parted ways with all my previous employers on an extremely good note.","time":1538682123,"title":"Ask HN: Is it okay to disclose your co-founder's incompetence to your

Most Americans are hourly employees, and don’t get paid time off to vote.

And then I need you to sign up at ElectionDay.org to make this commitment public.<p>If your folks are salaried, no worries. You’re still going to actively encourage them to vote, and you’re going to declare Election Day a no meeting day.  Or you’ll just open late that day, so everyone can vote in the morning.<p>Tech companies are influential. As tech goes, so will the rest of the country.  So today it’s tech companies, and tomorrow (or 2020) it’s every big box retailer giving all of their employees 3 hours paid time off to vote.<p>You&#x27;ll be in good company when you sign on.

Our free desktop app unifies all your work applications in one neat interface. Think of it as an efficient workspace for all your web tools.<p>We&#x27;ve always had a love &#x2F; hate relationship with our browser: it&#x27;s been our main work environment for the last 6 years but we keep struggling to stay focused and never found an efficient technique that would fix my natural impulse to open a new tab and get distracted.<p>After trying quite a few methods (Pomodoro, White noise, Do Not Disturb, ...) &amp; tools (Franz, Toby, Rambox, OneTab, etc.), we came to the conclusion that distraction is a core-design issue in modern browsers that can&#x27;t be solved with cosmetic changes or simple hacks. If you look at the very first Chrome interface (released 10 years ago!) you&#x27;ll notice that it isn&#x27;t significantly different from today&#x27;s v69. What has dramatically changed is the number of working hours you spend in it.<p>That&#x27;s why we built Station: it&#x27;s a SaaS focused, distraction-free platform (600+ apps) that&#x27;s not meant for browsing but solely for working with web apps. This translates in the first features we shipped: a &quot;Quick-Switch&quot; (a la Alfred) that allows you to quickly change page without losing focus, a &quot;Smart Dock&quot; that segments your workspace by automatically linking all pages to an app, a &quot;Focus Mode&quot; that kills all notifications with 1 click and an &quot;Autosleep&quot; (a la The Great Suspender) that intelligently unloads unused apps from your computer&#x27;s memory.<p>We realize we still have a long way to go to offer the delightful experience we aim for, but we&#x27;re committed to it. There are quite a few technical challenges, the main one being pushing the Electron framework to its limits: copy&#x2F;pasting is sometimes erratic, CPU load can spike, embedded Chrome is constantly obsolete, support of extensions is experimental, multi-window is a bit laggy, and I could go on and on :)<p>We won PH&#x27;s Product of the Year award last year (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;station-3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;station-3</a>) which led to a huge boost in active users. This comes with increased pressure to ship features and kill bugs: the community-fed roadmap (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;community.getstation.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;community.getstation.com&#x2F;</a>) is completely crammed but our team of 8 is truly grateful for the user feedback we&#x27;ve been getting. It&#x27;s been really precious, both motivation and product-wise.<p>This is just the beginning. Our vision is to build an entire operating system for SaaS applications. We want to provide a platform so 3rd party developers can build new features on top of existing web apps, offering users a more native and integrated experience across all of their work tools. Ultimately, anyone using web apps at work would find value in using Station.<p>We&#x27;re really excited to get your insights on what we&#x27;re building. On average, our users are active 5h per day in the app: we hope you find it nearly as useful!<p>PS.

I&#x27;ve created an encrypted personal organizer I wish to share with you all. I know.... you are sighing and thinking &quot;Oh! No! not another one&quot;.<p>doogiePIM is different in that it&#x27;s built by the same coder that created one of the very first PIMs that came out around 18+ years ago and creator of TexNotes way back then (it was actually called Scribillo. Wow, I feel old). The original PIM was sold then abandoned by GemX Software and that made me feel really bad. So, I obtained the full code and started to build a far better version of the information manager. One that will (hopefully) stand the test of time. The work is still ongoing, taking out the bugs, improving features and making it available to everyone around the world with localisation of the UI.<p>(Warning: I&#x27;m going to invoke Obi Wan Kenobi logic here....)\nTherefore, it&#x27;s not another PIM - it&#x27;s one of the oldest on the Internet... from a certain point of view :P<p>After a couple of years of work, I think it&#x27;s almost there. I&#x27;ve rewritten a huge chunk of code, implemented a more modern UI and reworked a lot of the database encryption. I can now start implementing some needed new features and quality-of-life implementations that help rather than hinder. Features such as Android connectivity and better importing of Cloud data. I&#x27;m pretty sure you guys will give me a guide as to what you need in a solid PIM.<p>I want to invite you all to take a look at my vision of a single focus PIM.

We&#x27;re a remote team, and have a few serious workaholics on the team (not to mention the issue of timezones).<p>- Leave when I&#x27;ve done my tasks. This might work if we had actual sprints. Our reality is an endless stream bugs and features for us to work on before we launch our product, and we just grab tickets as they come. Hopefully this improves after launch.<p>What do you do?

While the intentions are usually good, the problem is that there is no straightforward way to verify the claims of a hosted product.<p>As someone who is developing a privacy-minded product like this myself, I&#x27;ve been mulling over how to establish trust with my users in this situation. Surely there must be a way to offer the convenience of hosting whilst still offering privacy peace of mind?<p>Having an open source version of the hosted product is not enough, because it is not verifiable that the open source version is what&#x27;s being hosted. Privacy policies and terms of service don&#x27;t appear to be enough either, because as we&#x27;ve seen, they are easily violated or vaguely worded.<p>What I&#x27;ve been considering is something that acts similarly to how service-level agreements function, where if the SLA is violated, the customer receives a refund. This &quot;privacy-level agreement&quot; should somehow guarantee that if the established privacy policy is violated, the customer is entitled to some form of monetary compensation or can otherwise take legal action.<p>Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not a lawyer, so I don&#x27;t know exactly to what extent of the law such an agreement can be enforceable, so my questions to the HN community are: how

A couple days ago I installed Instagram from the App Store and created an IG account using an email like this &lt;lots_of_gibberish&gt;@&lt;domain&gt;.com (I have a catch-all setup for this domain). I didn&#x27;t give IG access to my contacts, didn&#x27;t provide my phone number nor connected it to Facebook.<p>At first the suggestions for new contacts in IG were completely random. However, after about 20-30 seconds the list of suggestions updated and showed me IG accounts of friends on Facebook.<p>I repeated this experiment, deleted &#x2F; installed the app, checked the iOS privacy controls, made sure not to enter the phone number or allow access to contacts, and again, I got the same account suggestions from FB friends.<p>I don&#x27;t undestand how Facebook &#x2F; Instagram is able to pull this off. The Instagram account email hasn&#x27;t been used at all before, the app doesn&#x27;t have access to my contacts and doesn&#x27;t know my phone number.

What seemed like a decent opportunity to kick-start my career quickly turned into what I believe would&#x27;ve been a dead end job which I would&#x27;ve dreaded every day of my life, so I decided to quit last summer and enroll into a Masters in Data Science. Being used to a monthly salary and not having to ask my parents for money I feared this moment as I knew I would have had to deal back on my QoL quite a bit, but on top of that me and my family have had a string of misfortunes and now money is quite thight (nothing like going bankrupt, but still requires careful management of our finances). All this combined, I find myself starting a new study cycle which will last at minimum two years and almost no money; hence I&#x27;m wondering: how does a student in CompSci make money while studying?\nApart from the obvious part time jobs (retail, fast foods etc.) - which I would like to avoid as I fear they would sap my time and strength without letting me grow as a computer scientist - I&#x27;ve looked into freelance gigs, consulting work and remote companies; unluckily for me, most if not all the opportunities I&#x27;ve come across require a full-time commitment, something I don&#x27;t have the luxury of giving unless I decide to take way more than 2 years to graduate, and freelancing in particular seems to focus on webdev&#x2F;mobile, areas which are not my strong suit and I don&#x27;t even like that much.<p>What would you recommend in this situation? Swallow the pill and learn stacks that sell through freelancing? Find something completely unrelated to CompSci that allows me to work part-time? Start emailing every company offering CS jobs in the area and asking if they&#x27;re willing to take on a part-timer?<p>Thanks in advance for your advice!","time":1538036211,"title":"Ask HN: How do you make money as a Computer Science student?","type":"story"},{"by":"IN4RA3D","descendants":10,"id":18082759,"kids":[18091487,18091440,18091947,18091771,18091740],"score":32,"time":1538035310,"title":"Searching for Tuva: Before the internet and now","type":"story","url":"https://www.blog.google/products/search/searching-tuva-internet-and-now/"},{"by":"ednarga","descendants":6,"id":18082738,"kids":[18082762,18083291],"score":4,"text":"Cannot get past the recruiter&#x2F;HR call, any suggestions?","time":1538035031,"title":"Ask HN: Cannot get past the recruiter/HR call, any suggestions?","type":"story"},{"by":"plvch","descendants":3,"id":18082719,"kids":[18085442,18082787,18092089],"score":4,"time":1538034735,"title":"Ask HN: What are the most annoying things about tech recruiters?","type":"story"},{"by":"YeGoblynQueenne","descendants":206,"id":18082684,"kids":[18083475,18082993,18083353,18083325,18084108,18085233,18084322,18082797,18083133,18085564,18089926,18088495,18083528,18085422,18082867,18082793,18083402,18085447,18091645,18088575,18083794,18082852,18083297,18082859,18083558,18087237,18083748,18088556,18088191,18084545,18083048,18082792,18083690,18082899],"score":481,"time":1538034029,"title":"After century of removing appendixes, doctors find antibiotics can be enough","type":"story","url":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/09/after-century-of-removing-appendixes-docs-find-antibiotics-can-be-enough/"},{"by":"mcenedella","descendants":21,"id":18082604,"kids":[18083037,18086759,18082861,18085445,18085220,18085952,18082840,18086540],"score":143,"time":1538032863,"title":"Profiling CPython at Instagram (2017)","type":"story","url":"https://instagram-engineering.com/profiling-cpython-at-instagram-89d4cbeeb898"},{"by":"lainon","descendants":9,"id":18082465,"kids":[18091855,18093592,18091975],"score":59,"time":1538029891,"title":"Automated PCB Reverse Engineering (2017) [pdf]","type":"story","url":"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/woot17/woot17-paper-kleber.pdf"},{"by":"lainon","descendants":9,"id":18082384,"kids":[18082689,18082636,18084997],"score":82,"time":1538028362,"title":"Ghostbuster: Detecting the Presence of Hidden Eavesdroppers [pdf]","type":"story","url":"https://synrg.csl.illinois.edu/papers/ghostbuster-mobicom18.pdf"},{"by":"janvdberg","descendants":84,"id":18082345,"kids":[18087578,18087044,18087444,18087022,18087036,18086806,18088033,18087612,18087111,18090698,18088613,18088035,18088391,18089365,18089822,18098517,18088533,18089979,18089102,18090531,18086613,18086602,18088906,18086688,18092646,18087743,18087666,18087377],"score":182,"time":1538027651,"title":"Bloated","type":"story","url":"http://fabiensanglard.net/bloated/index.php"},{"by":"erickhill","descendants":20,"id":18082332,"kids":[18088974,18089442,18088372,18088070,18088095,18088318,18088218,18088734,18088666,18089384,18089399],"score":28,"time":1538027372,"title":"Me and My Numb Thumb: A Tale of Tech, Texts and Tendons","type":"story","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/19/technology/smartphone-overuse-numb-thumb.html"},{"by":"kjeetgill","descendants":171,"id":18082295,"kids":[18084563,18082649,18082528,18086295,18083646,18083383,18082996],"score":262,"time":1538026678,"title":"The future of Java and OpenJDK updates without Oracle support","type":"story","url":"https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/09/24/the-future-of-java-and-openjdk-updates-without-oracle-support/"},{"by":"smaili","descendants":30,"id":18082201,"kids":[18084459,18084161,18085707,18087163,18086087,18087319,18085162],"score":66,"time":1538024570,"title":"Crypto mining giant Bitmain reveals heady growth as it files for IPO","type":"story","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/26/bitmain-hong-kong-ipo/"},{"by":"sbr464","descendants":27,"id":18082133,"kids":[18082624,18082469,18082189,18082210,18101186,18082198,18082146,18084076,18082159,18082249],"score":8,"text":"For lack of better words, outside of the concept of electricity.","time":1538023242,"title":"Ask HN: Does programming have any value outside of electronic systems?","type":"story"},{"by":"dfabulich","descendants":3,"id":18082132,"kids":[18082137,18082607],"score":4,"time":1538023210,"title":"Marzipan","type":"story","url":"http://benjaminmayo.co.uk/marzipan"},{"by":"chrisco255","descendants":11,"id":18082102,"kids":[18082498,18084209,18082483,18082459,18082291,18084663,18084580],"score":26,"text":"Having little experience with search engines, I wonder whether it would be possible to create an open source alternative to Google?

Given our backgrounds, we were able to raise a decent angel round, enough to quit jobs and work on our idea.<p>Problem at hand: In the last couple of months, the team has been extremely demotivated and our earliest couple of employees left us citing issues with management. Almost all the issues are related to my cofounder&#x27;s attitude. If I had to summarize them<p>1. Extremely authoritative and a lack of inclination to learn&#x2F;understand - This is very demotivating for the tech team<p>2. Non performance, Lying and erosion of credibility - We hardly get any customer interactions and employees often wonder what my cofounder is doing and some have directly asked me. However, whenever questioned either we get false confirmation of work that never happens or get asked to just wait and be patient as things take time.<p>3. Stingy - My cofounder is penny wise pound foolish. This has led to massive compromises in the hiring as well as internal team frustration due to unnecessary cost optimization<p>Independent of all this, I very much believe in what we are building and hence want to take this to a good logical end at least.

Here&#x27;s what sucks about NYC:<p>1) Home<p>- Apartments are expensive. Can get 4x more space in Chicago for same price.<p>- Difficult to shop for home. Wanted a desk for my bedroom. None of the stores in the city, included Target, offered reasonable-priced desks that could fit. Had to buy online, which came with own issues.<p>2) Services<p>- Services are expensive. Want to get your hair dyed blond from someone you saw on Instagram? It&#x27;s $600 and they ruin your hair.<p>3) Food<p>- Groceries are expensive and inconvenient. Get delivery or Whole Foods and pay 30-70% over Trader Joe&#x27;s price. Or you need to walk&#x2F;Uber to Trader Joe&#x27;s, wait in line, then walk&#x2F;Uber back. Local bodegas? Usually bad quality and high prices (eg watermelon is $25).<p>- Restaurants are expensive. Entree&#x27;s in Manhattan are usually $25-35.<p>- Food isn&#x27;t uniquely great. I recently went to a well-rated David Chang restaurant in Chelsea. Meh.<p>- Grocery delivery is usually done by foot. Sometimes this is great, sometimes it leads to food being delivered hours late, warm, and gross. This happens across platforms.<p>4) Transportation<p>- Can&#x27;t have a car in Manhattan. Parking is $600&#x2F;month in my building. Btw, the doorman gets 50%, so $300&#x2F;month (yay!).<p>- Car rentals are quite expensive in the city. Want to rent a van to go camping? That&#x27;s even worse.<p>- Uber and Lyft is extremely slow in the city. I generally prefer taxi&#x27;s since drivers understand how to get around faster. They&#x27;re also priced competitively.<p>5) Airport<p>- Traffic between airports is quite bad. Usually about an hour. Makes me jealous of the 20 min SFO commute.<p>6) Healthcare<p>- Want to book a doctor or therapist? Go to Zocdoc, enter your insurance, try to book - they call you in a day saying they&#x27;re booked or don&#x27;t take your insurance.

This is due to the nature of Chrome&#x27;s implementation of the policy.<p>If you maintain any WebAudio code the fix is below. For any code that hasn&#x27;t been fixed and isn&#x27;t maintained, expect it to stop working soon in Chrome. :(<p>--<p>Background:<p>This is part of the &quot;no autoplaying&quot; policy that rolled out in Chrome 66, and was reverted for WebAudio a few days later because it broke everything (including Chrome&#x27;s own webaudio demos).

Once that fires, the audioContext will work normally.<p>Basically Chrome&#x27;s implementation of the policy doesn&#x27;t look at when an audioContext <i>plays sounds</i>, it only cares when (a) the context is created, and (b) `context.resume()` is called. If either of those happens inside a user event handler, that context can play sounds. But if you create a context at startup and never call `resume` (like most WebAudio demos), the context will be muted regardless of whether it waits for user input.","time":1537885087,"title":"Tell HN: Legacy WebAudio content will break in Chrome 70","type":"story"},{"by":"daegloe","descendants":221,"id":18066410,"kids":[18066886,18069552,18066758,18070583,18070748,18068347,18071680,18067630,18071209,18083858,18071791,18071648,18071126,18067324,18066892,18069378,18067019,18070265],"score":315,"time":1537884657,"title":"Evidence that addictive behaviors have links with ancient retroviral infection","type":"story","url":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/09/180924174503.htm"},{"by":"tomazio","descendants":10,"id":18066306,"kids":[18066403,18066402,18066399,18066371,18071703,18068268,18066391],"score":27,"text":"I&#x27;ve read a good amount of threads in the last couple months saying getting hired by one of the FAANG companies will get you the best compensation package for an entry level position, while simultaneously seeing many people saying working at one of the FAANG companies isn&#x27;t all it&#x27;s made out to be and some people even saying it made them worse off.

My job starts at 9am and I get up at 8am. Naturally, I&#x27;d sleep until 10am. That means I&#x27;m jet lagged by 2 hours every single day. I go to bed around midnight, but can rarely fall asleep until 1-2am. I use a medical grade light box in the morning.<p>The consequences of all the sleep deprivation are pretty dire. I keep getting fatter and feel terrible. It seems to be messing with my digestion. Of course, I&#x27;m constantly tired at work and have to make up the sleep debt on the weekend, which leaves me little time to actually enjoy my days off.<p>I know that it&#x27;s the sleep because I took a sabbatical and lost a ton of weight - and then gained it all back after going back to work. No changes in diet or workout.<p>I&#x27;ve asked about starting work later, but the response was complete non-understanding - my manager seemed offended that I&#x27;d even ask for that, when everyone else was coming in at the same time as me. I didn&#x27;t want to start a huge debate so I wouldn&#x27;t be &quot;that sick guy who wants special treatment&quot;. But I guess I do want &quot;special&quot; treatment so that my schedule won&#x27;t make me sick.<p>How have other night owls dealt with this? If 30% of us are late risers, there must be huge demand for jobs that start later. I&#x27;ve never even heard of a job that would let me start late enough to wake up at 10am, except maybe a 100% remote job. That would probably severely limit the opportunities and number of jobs available, but I really feel like I can&#x27;t do this to my body much longer - 20s were fine, 30s don&#x27;t seem so fine.

I took a job just before graduation with a small custom software development firm that focuses on custom web and mobile applications for businesses in and around my local area, and in which all employees work remote full-time, which I’ve since learned may not be the best situation for me. During the interview, much of the discussion revolved around mobile experience, and as such I believed that I’d be primarily working on mobile application development, which may have been true had our contracts at the time not all been web applications. I had no real experience with the stack the company used, nor significant experience with web development.<p>I live in an at-will employment area, so I was fired without notice, because I was taking too long to accomplish tasks and milestones on the contract I was assigned. This is an issue that had been discussed with me a 3 or 4 weeks prior to the termination of my employment, and my employers and I agreed to a 2-week probationary period to assess my progress before deciding on continuation of my employment. At the end of this period, I was not proactive in obtaining feedback on my performance, and as such received little-to-none. Today, I was told that my performance was not satisfactory, and I was let go, which seems perfectly reasonable to me.<p>Now I’m unemployed and have no idea what to do next. I&#x27;ve considered looking for freelance work while I find a solid job, but I don&#x27;t really know what to look for. I&#x27;ve reached out to my former employer to receive more feedback on my performance to know exactly what I need to improve on, so I feel that I&#x27;ll have a solid foundation to make the changes

The first time, I already thought I was kind of in a bad shape. But tonight, I reached a new low point. I have been out of a job for a long time. Currently, my only income is from a small remote job that requires no special skills. I can only survive on it, because I moved to a developing country in Southeast Asia. But this is a dead-end. I need to change - everything. I know the best way would be through a job that would allow me to gradually learn new skills. I don&#x27;t really care that much about pay. I can survive on a few hundred dollars a month. Although I would like to say that I&#x27;m willing to do almost anything, I also know my limitations. I previously created some websites on my own using Ruby on Rails. But I&#x27;m probably quite far from a &#x27;real&#x27; hacker who enjoys coding so much, they do it in their free time as well. For me, programming is just a tool to get what I want. Also, I always struggled a lot with front-end development and would often get frustrated when things didn&#x27;t work. I never quite gave up on becoming a real developer - however, at the same time, I never had enough motivation to practice on my own until I would have reached a professional level. I believe the only way would if I could receive a lot of guidance. I did think about attending one of those coding bootcamps, but 1st, they are very expensive, and 2nd, they seem to be high-stress environments - and there is my other big weakness, I really don&#x27;t respond well to stress at all. So, I guess what I&#x27;m hoping to find is some sort of coding internship where I could really very slowly grow into the role - without much pressure. I don&#x27;t know how much sense that makes or if it&#x27;s even remotely realistic. But I just thought I would give it a shot.

started coding about 4 years ago but I feel like I&#x27;m in a bit of a rut lately. I understand the basic building blocks perfectly, but higher level concepts, for example, abstracting the database away through an interface layer so that we may achieve proper unit testing in Go, are much harder for me to figure out. I understand WHY I need to do this, and I understand what is going on on a high level, but I get a bit lost when it comes time to implement. All the unit testing examples out there show examples of how to unit test a function that squares an integer. That has zero real world benefit to me. How would I unit test an http handler func that is the entry point for a RESTful API? I need to do authentication, database access, and return some JSON data. How do I keep the test as one &quot;unit&quot; when I need to do all of these things?<p>I feel like there are some intermediary steps or knowledge that I am lacking, where a more senior engineer would be able to figure out how to do unit testing in a real world app based on the squaring function alone. Again, this is just a singular example, but the theme is pretty consistent across any higher level programming challenge I come across.<p>There are plenty of tutorials out there about how to learn PHP (yuck) or JavaScript for newbies, but there are surprisingly few resources for people interested in becoming experts. I&#x27;m the only technical person at my job currently, so asking senior engineers for help really isn&#x27;t an option. Where do I go to fill these gaps in my knowledge? Are there other engineers out there that felt the existence of a &quot;skills chasm&quot; that they had to cross?

Opinions appreciated. :)<p>Goal: \nTo continue learning how to build companies from a holistic perspective. As a prospective founder, I aim to be well-rounded to be able to understand the diverse challenges from each side of the company. I currently have:<p>- 2 years of iOS dev experience<p>- 2.5 years of product management (B2B2C SaaS)<p>I have spent my whole career in early stage startups (&lt; 30 employees, between Series A &amp; B).<p>Possible Next Step:<p>(1) continuing to dive deeper into product at a larger company to learn how a well-oiled machine operates<p>or<p>(2) jumping to sales&#x2F;bizdev<p>Why #1 makes sense:<p>At this point in my career, I’ve worked on going from 0 to 1, finding product market fit, and wearing lots of hats outside of product.\nIt would be interesting to work on a mature product with an existing, larger user base.<p>Why #2 makes sense:<p>I love interacting with people. I have a personal CRM and host weekly dinner parties in order to bring people together. Reaching out to people while at early stage companies to raise money, talk about partnerships, etc, was a very fun part of the job. When I start a company, I am SO excited about the prospect of pitching my idea to get people to believe in the vision.<p>Closing thoughts:\nIt’s tough to admit this, but I do not think I’m cut out to be a professional developer. I love building things but enjoy having control beyond the implementation process. At least in the development jobs I’ve had, they were not enjoyable because I was always being told what to do.<p>I am intrigued by sales or biz dev, but the two concerns are:\n(1) will I have to take a major pay cut vs. a PM role at a large company? I expect target range for latter to be in $110-130K area. Money is not that important, just want to ensure not a ~50% pay cut.\n(2) is it seen as a step down to go from a PM to an account manager or something similar?<p>A hybrid role is ideal, but realize that roles at larger companies are more clearly defined.<p>Thanks for reading :)","time":1537294095,"title":"Ask HN: Continue as a PM or jump to sales?","type":"story"},{"by":"xx_9_y","dead":true,"id":18017884,"kids":[18019500,18024352,18022824],"score":83,"time":1537295580,"title":"Show HN: Panther – A browser testing and web crawling library for PHP","type":"story","url":"https://github.com/symfony/panther"},{"by":"drjohnson","descendants":5,"id":18017534,"kids":[18032025,18032809,18031587,18030869],"score":47,"time":1537293091,"title":"What Makes a Waif?","type":"story","url":"https://www.lrb.co.uk/v40/n17/joanne-oleary/what-makes-a-waif"},{"by":"drewem","descendants":21,"id":18017463,"kids":[18019024,18018820,18018401,18018298,18019226,18017870],"score":4,"time":1537292634,"title":"Why don’t college students vote absentee?

frontend. I always use CSS &quot;framework&quot; on the frontend like Bootstrap and usually buy some theme when I start a project and start from there.

Sir Isaac Newton, Thomas Edison and Linus Torvalds himself to name a few. Such characters are also common in literature and movies like Sherlock Holmes and Gregory House for example.
